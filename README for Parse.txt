README for Parse.py and mk.test

	mk.test and Parse.py should be in the same folder/directory. Also in this same folder/directory should be the folder/directory TestingMaterials. This TestingMaterials contains an input file with ideal script formatted and a set of six output files with the correct output that should be produced by Parse.py with this input file. The shell script mk.test will compare the output generated by running Parse.py with the given input file against the pre-written ideal output files. If no differences are returned then there are no errors, otherwise there is an error.
