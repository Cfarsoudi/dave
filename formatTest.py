"""
This program that outputs screenplays with the correct format could not be 
tested with traditional unit testing. Of all the methods I wrote to ouput text
to the pdf, none returned anything, so it's hard to use unit testing. Instead,
I wrote a sample script and tested the corner cases like around the page 
break. The acceptance criteria for this test includes: headings, characters, 
action, dialogue, parantheticals, and transitions formatted correctly, no 
awkward page breaks, spacing and indentation is consistent, no text runs off
the page, page numbers are formatted correctly, correct capitalization
