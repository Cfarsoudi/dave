Unit test for Stanley:

      The purpose of Stanley (also called the director algorithm) is to select what kind of text to create next in the script. Screenplay text exists in 6 catagories: Scene headings, actions, dialogue, character names, parentheticals, and transitions. These follow one another in very specific ways (for example: you can have several paragraphs of action following one another, but after a character name you must have either a parenthetical or a bit of dialogue). Because this is complex, it’s extremely difficult if not impossible to automate the test for this module. Therefore we here have a guide to manually test for the correct functioning of Stanley.

	If Parse.py and generator are functioning properly then we can use the output of those programs for input in our test. If not we can manually add a series of lists, one for each format of test (heading, action, etc.) and run Stanley with those as input.

	The correct output will start with a scene heading. All scene headings will be followed by actions. Actions can be followed either by a transition, a character name, a scene heading or another action. A transition can be followed by a character name, a scene heading or an action. A character name must be followed by either dialogue or a parenthetical. A Parenthetical must be followed by dialogue. Dialogue can be followed by either a character name or by action. Any deviation from these is an error.
