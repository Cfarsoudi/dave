 1A EXT: PROLOGUE ON BLACK - NIGHT

 The screen is black, music evoking religion and danger begins.

                                LILLY
                    For three hundred years the great plagues have
                    swept the earth. Diseases created from the
                    experiments of the Alchemists.

 We see death tolls appear through this graphically.

 The plague - 5 million souls. Virulent Small Pox - 10 million.
 Mutated Influenza 30 Million Souls...

                                Lilly
                    Thinking they had discovered Gods secret code for
                    life, the Alchemists experimented with genetic
                    science. They had no idea what they had
                    unleashed.

  We begin to see a strange medallion sweeping through smoke, slowly
  revealing itself.

                                LILLY (CONT'D)
                         (continuing)
                    ...but there was also a miracle. One of these
                    plagues helped nature create a new kind of being.
                    At first they were called Nosferatu, or Vampire
                    and were feared. But they were not supernatural
                    monsters, just a better version of ourselves.
                    They were the Brothers, and their religion and
                    science helped sustain us against the plagues and
                    influenzas that have ravaged Europe and the rest
                    of the colonies. For 300 years our two races have
                    lived in harmony. Until now...


                                          FADE UP:

2 INT: DOCTORS SURGERY - DAY                                2

 We are very close on a bespectacled eye. It stares at us and
 then looks down.

                     GENETIC DOCTOR
                  (off)
           See here. This is what you need to
           look for.

 Cut to the object in the Genetic Doctors hand; it is like an
 x-ray, yet the image looks remarkably like a DNA profile.

                     GENETIC DOCTOR
                  (continuing; off)
           A genetic mutation, we all carry
           it. But we now know a virus
           activates it.
                                                                3

We reveal the genetic Doctor, sitting at his desk, smoking a
cigarette. The surgery and the clothes suggest the year, yet
there are small things that are different, not what you'd
expect to be around at this time. Standing next to him in the
dusty haze of the room is a younger doctor; an apprentice who
looks attentive.

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
                (continuing)
         This Virus plays some unknown role
         in the birth the Brothers. Of
         course the mutation occurs very
         rarely these days. And only in
         males.

The apprentice nods and then looks up. There is someone else
in the room. A woman - who we now see is pregnant. There is
something about her that suggests more a prisoner or
psychiatric patient than a normal pregnant mother.

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
                (continuing)
         Strange isn't?

                    Apprentice   DOCTOR
         Strange?

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
         That God would choose such humble
         vehicle for a miracle. The mothers
         invariably come from the slums, we
         don't know why.
                (to the woman)
         This is your 7th isn't it?
                                                                 4




We see the woman; she's like a hollow person, hardly aware of
where she is. The Doctor shuffles papers. Finds what he wants.

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
                (continuing)
         Yes, her first was successful, a
         Brother was born. Thereafter
         variously malformed offspring. We
         can only hope this one will be
         different.
                (to woman)
         You'll have to try harder this
         time.

The woman now looks up. And tentatively speaks.

                     WOMAN IN THE SURGURY
         Please...

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
         What is it?

                   WOMAN IN THE SURGURY
         Please... I want to keep my baby.
         They always take my babies away.

                   GENETIC DOCTOR
         Don't be stupid woman!

The woman drops her eyes. We see the Apprentice Doctor,
almost pitying the poor woman.

                   Apprentice DOCTOR
                (to woman)
         You won't have to worry. The
         Brotherhood will take him...

We are closer on the woman now. Tears begin to glisten in her
eyes as we drift closer to her.

                   Apprentice DOCTOR
                (continuing; off)
         ...raise him in the church, teach
         him. He's special. You should be
         proud. It's a blessing really,
         he'll want for nothing. Not like
         the rest of us?

We track in closer, closer, to the woman, then continue,
right into her eye, through the fluid, to see the room
reflected upside down at the back of the retina. This
dissolves to an upside view of...
                                                                  5




3 INT: HOSPITAL, OPERATION ROOM - DAY                         3

 POV, baby's view, in an operating theatre.

 Cut to

 The woman we saw earlier with the Genetic Doctor; she has
 just given birth. The baby is placed on linen blankets and
 cleaned by a nurse.

 A man now enters the operating theatre; we can tell the
 Doctor is uneasy. The man is dressed in a perfectly cut suit.
 He does not wear a surgical mask. His eyes are a piercingly
 clear light gray. He enters with two other men who look
 similar to him. By his side there is also a pristine boy;
 perhaps 8 years old, the same piercing eyes. They both
 approach the baby. The man stares serenely at the baby, all
 bloody, lying on blankets.

                     AUGUSTUS
           This is your brother Silus. You
           will teach him.

 The little boy then shares a glance with the woman who has
 just given birth. She seems to recognize the boy.

                     SILUS AS A BOY
           Is that my mother?

                     AUGUSTUS
           No, not any more.

 Augustus then leans forward and gently opens the baby's mouth.

 We see the baby close. In the otherwise baby-like mouth we
 see something strange. There are two tiny fangs protruding
 from the otherwise smooth gums.

 We see Augustus smile. In his mouth too, we see two perfectly
 pointed teeth.

                     AUGUSTUS
                  (continuing)
           Welcome to the world little
           Brother.

 Cut to

 We end close on the baby; its piercing eyes.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:
                                                                   6

                         Perfect Creature

  The title fades. Then another title appears.


               Queen's Imperial Winter Residence,

                        The Pacific Colony

                        100 years later

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


4A EXT: CITYSCAPE - NIGHT                                     4A

  We see a city, seething with smoke from coal fires, steam
  from engines, alien distorted Victorian spires are
  silhouetted against the moody, moonlit sky which is literally
  filled with dirigibles and strange flying machines that seem
  Victorian, of the industrial revolution, but that are also
  strangely futuristic. It is 1969, but not our 1969.


5 EXT: STREET - NIGHT                                         5

  A street. The look - of the film and the night - is silver,
  almost metallic moonlit skies. A hazy mist hangs in the air.
  Wet, steel pools of water on the dark footpath where a man
  stands. He stares up at a zeppelin passing overhead, its
  shadow obscuring him briefly until it passes away. Then we
  see him.

  The man is handsome, in a perfectly cut long wool jacket;
  dark gray. He wears perfectly shiny black shoes and we can
  see the surrounding street reflected in them; Victorian,
  Gothic buildings. This man is Silus. He surveys the street.
  While the houses are beautiful, they're run down.

  Silus - his eyes are the purest light gray you have ever
  seen - takes a long long inhale through his nose, his eyes
  closing briefly as if trying to sense/smell something. He
  stops the breath and opens his eyes. They are clear, full of
  purpose.

  He bends down to the footpath, runs his hand along its
  surface, almost caressing it. He closes his eyes. The camera
  moves in, to end close on Silus' ear. As this happens the
  soundtrack - all the noises in the night - become amplified.
  We see Silus' face, see him concentrating intently. We hear
  several individual noises. First a very quiet pitter patter.

  Cut to

  A cat, stealthily moving between some thorny rose bushes.

  Cut to
                                                                7




Silus again; concentrating even more. Now the distant sound
of trickling water.

Cut to

A drain pipe, leaking.

Cut to

Silus once more. This time we can hear "plop, plop, plop."

Cut to

A pool of water. Then "plop" as a drop hits it. The drop is
not water. The drop is a red liquid, thick, now dispersing in
the water. And another drop, "plop." High speed CRANE UP from

this pool, up up the side of a building to end on a FACE in
the shadows. We can see reflective, gleaming eyes. And a
mouth, with blood dripping from it.

Cut to

Silus again. His eyes flicking open; we see the footpath
reflected in those perfect light gray eyes.

Music - brooding, ancient - begins to hum as Silus slowly
rises, as if his limbs have the power to make him float, so
perfect and powerful are they. A small smile has appeared on
his lips; it is the smile of a man who knows that something
very dark, something very dangerous, is close by.

Slowly his hand slips into his jacket. He holds it there,
watching, surveying the street immediately ahead of him for
the slightest movement. He sees it. On the wall of an old
Georgian Mansion across the road, a shape on the side of the
wall, almost imperceptible, hidden in the shadows and
brickwork. A CREATURE on the side of the wall.

Silus begins to move forward now, everything in perfect
shining silver slow motion. As he moves forward he pulls a
gun from his jacket - it is silver, organic and glass, art
nouveaux styling - and points it ahead of him as he glides
forward.

The creature on the wall senses the movement coming towards
it, moves a little and then, like a spider, scrambles along
the side of the wall, heading away from us.

Silus fires. A bullet of silver explodes from the gun, seems
almost to hang in the air for a moment, reflecting the moon
above, before hurtling at high speed towards its target.

The shell explodes the wall next to the creature, who stops
suddenly in the light so that we can see it.
                                                                 8



 A man. With reflective animal eyes and blood on his purple
 lips. And teeth; the teeth of a vampire. This creature
 immediately dives from the wall to the ground, just avoiding
 another two bullets that crash into the wall.

 LA as the man falls directly towards the camera.

 Silus now rushes forward, holding his gun out in front of
 him; he moves forward gracefully. He can see the man
 skillfully climbing up an adjacent derelict building. Silus
 tries to follow but his way is blocked by wire and fencing.
 He raises his gun towards the man once more, but he is gone.

 Close on Silus' enigmatic face. Those eyes. And in his mouth,
 two perfectly pointed fangs.

6 EXT: CAFE - NIGHT                                          6

 We are outside a cafe; the cafe is a warm glow against the
 cold night. We see past the fine falling rain - through the
 large glass window that has swirling silver art nouveaux
 designs lacing across it - to a table inside, by the window,
 where two pristinely dressed men sit.

 Cut to


7 INT: CAFE - NIGHT                                          7

 We are inside. Closer on the two men. One is SILUS. The other
 man is AUGUSTUS; the man we saw in the operation theatre
 before. Augustus has hardly aged at all.

                       AUGUSTUS
           The girl?

 We see Silus. He remembers.

 Cut to


8 INT: ROOM, FLASHBACK - NIGHT                               8

 Flashback from Silus' memory; a dead girl on a bed, blood
 splattered across her pillow.

 Cut to
                                                                  9




9 INT: CAFE - NIGHT                                           9

 Silus' face. Pull out to reveal we're back in the café.

                      SILUS

           It is taken care of.

                     AUGUSTUS
           This is good.

                     SILUS
           Augustus. We failed this girl. We
           asked her to help us catch him,
           and then we failed her.

                     AUGUSTUS
           Yes. But her death served a
           greater good. Every trap needs
           bait.

 Augustus lifts a beautifully designed glass and silver pipe
 from the onyx table at which they sit, then settles back into
 a fine hardwood chair. The chair's swirling, delicate back
 creeks as he takes a puff on the pipe.

                     AUGUSTUS
                  (continuing)
           Are you sure you won't join me?

 Silus shakes his head, no. The opium in the pipe crackles.

                     SILUS
           Perhaps this is beyond us. Perhaps
           we should inform the authorities.
           The human beings.

 Augustus places the pipe down, blows a smoke ring as a
 Chinese woman, dressed in a sarong, brings over two finely
 cut crystal glasses and sets them before the men, then
 leaves. Silus now lifts the glass and we see what it
 contains. Blood; dark and red and viscous. Silus takes a sip,
 then looks over to the bar.

 There is a young woman there, sitting at the bar, being
 treated with great care by several of the elegantly dressed
 patrons; the young woman laughs, enjoying the attention.
 Tubes run from the young woman's arms. These tubes carry her
 blood into a conch shaped glass bowl. We see the Chinese
 waitress fill another glass from the bowl.

 Silus watches, blood slightly present on his ashen lips. And
 we see two perfectly pointed fangs hanging in his mouth.

                     AUGUSTUS
           For now the Brothers feel we
           should deal with this ourselves.
                                                                  10




                      SILUS
            If they find out we are covering
            up these deaths...

                      AUGUSTUS
            Which is why you must find him.
            Silus.

  Silus now turns to Augustus, still looking unconvinced.

                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            For centuries we Brothers have
            served mankind and them us. The
            great union. But remember your
            history. 300 years ago when our
            kind were first born into this
            world they burnt our children as
            monsters. They had no notion of
            evolution. In another world we
            might all have been slaughtered,
            only to be remembered in myth,
            monsters to frighten the young or
            a puzzle for anthropologists. We
            must refuse to let one aberrant
            individual destroy the balance
            between the two races. The old
            prejudices are still there. Human
            beings are paranoid creatures by
            nature.

                      SILUS
            Perhaps they have good reason.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Silus. Simply concern yourself
            with finding Edgar. Find your
            Brother so that we can help him.
            Before he kills again.

10 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, STREET - DAY                        10

  Close up of a NEWSPAPER. On it we see a banner headline.
  "Influenza Vaccine Shortages lead to Black Market Trade." We
  pull out to reveal the paper is lying on a foot path. Wind
  blows the newspaper out of shot and we tilt up to the street.

  The street is wet, glistening. The rain, rain rain rain. The
  Edwardian and Victorian buildings of the street might seem
  beautiful, but they are not. They are largely derelict. We
  see a woman standing in a doorway out of the rain.
                                                                    11




  She is wrapped in a black plastic jacket that she pulls about
  her. A man approaches her.

                      JONES
            Everyone's ready Lilly.

                      LILLY
            About time.

  They both move to one of the tall buildings; a four story,
  ancient tenement that looks empty, almost derelict.

  They quietly move up the steps of the place and then pause.
  There is the bleep from a strange looking valve powered
  Walkie Talkie; hereafter called an RT.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing)
            On three gents. One, two...


11 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT, HALLWAY - DAY                11

  CRASH CUT to the door of the building swinging open wildly,
  a hand held camera on the shoulder of Lilly and Jones.

  A large, grubby looking woman stands in a long, grim hallway,
  mop in hand. At the far end of the hall another door
  disconnects from its hinges and collapses inwards, two men
  appearing out of the rain.

                      JONES
                   (to the woman)
            Don't you move!

  We see a gun in Jones' hand as he moves towards the woman,
  who has her hands up and is getting down on her knees.

  The camera then pans wildly, left and right. Then Lilly's
  foot kicks in a door to our right, revealing a dank office
  and a man, half naked, reaching for a gun. A woman is lying
  on a cot and she's screaming. She is instantly recognizable
  as a prostitute.

                      LILLY
                   (to the slum landlord)
            Don't you dare.

  From this POV we see Lilly's hand pointing a gun at the SLUM
  LANDLORD, who is now slowly easing back into the scummy
  office.

                        LILLY
                     (continuing)
            Jones!
                                                                   12




  We now finally cut to see Lilly. She is around 25; an
  intelligent, handsome 25. The man Jones appears at her
  shoulder, leering. Jones is the type of guy you just know
  will go to seed at 40. But that's still 10 years away. Jones
  stares at the Slum Landlord who is trying to cover himself.

                      JONES
            God help us. What an appalling
            sight.


12 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT, HALLWAY - LATER             12

  The hallway again. The other two men we saw entering at the
  beginning are talking to the woman with the mop. One of the
  men is taking notes.

  We pan to the office, to see Lilly and Jones standing before
  the Slum Landlord, who is now wrapped in a towel and sitting
  in a chair.

                      SLUM LANDLORD
            I don't know nothing about it. I
            give 'em out. Make sure everyone
            gets 'em.

                      JONES
            That's a lie! We know you've been
            trading influenza vaccine in the
            workhouses!

  Another man now approaches Lilly.

                      FRANK
            Lil'. I think you should see this.


13 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT, HALLWAY - CONTINUING        13

  Halfway down the hall there is a door, Frank opens it
  displaying a set of stairs leading down.

                      FRANK
            I'd use the mask if I were you.

  Lilly pulls a dark surgical-type mask over her face, then
  slowly moves down the steps into the oblivion below.


14 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT BASEMENT - CONTINUING        14

  Cut between Lilly's POV and her face, her eyes glimmering in
  the sub-light as she moves down the stairs very carefully.
                                                                    13




  And finally the horror is revealed. In this basement there
  are 10 or 12 people, lying on the floor. Most of them are
  silent, but a couple moan. One, a woman, pleads to Lilly.

                      WOMAN IN THE BASEMENT
            Help me. Please help.

  The woman extends her arm. It is covered in sweat; grimy. The
  glands at the side of the woman's neck are distended and
  swollen, her eyes bloodshot.

                      WOMAN IN THE BASEMENT
                   (continuing)
            Please. I'm sick. Please.

  The room is a version of hell. Lilly's eyes glisten.

15 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, TENEMENT OFFICE - CONTINUING           15

  Jones has the Slum Landlord by the throat.

                      JONES
            You're a fucking liar!

                      SLUM LANDLORD
            No, no, I swear it, I gave 'em
            their boosters, both of 'em. I'm
            a responsible landlord, I swear to
            god. There must've been something
            wrong with them vaccines.

  Lilly stares at the Slum Landlord; shock in her face, and
  anger.

                      JONES
            This is a civil health violation!
            You're going to the hell house for
            this. You can forget lovely Doris
            here where you're going.

  We see the woman who was screaming before, the prostitute;
  she makes an obscene gesture at Jones. As this is going on
  Frank and the other man we've seen are tearing the place
  apart, looking for something. They don't find it and Frank's
  look tells Lilly so.

  Lilly's face is a mask. She is watching the Slum Landlord
  very carefully. He keeps looking down; strangely, nervously.
                                                                14




                   SLUM LANDLORD
         I don't know what you're on about.
         I've done nothing, I swear to god,
         I've done nothing.

Lilly lets her eyes drift down, all the way down to the chair
legs, which rock unevenly on the floor. Lilly is staring at
the scratched, worn floor boards which MOVE.

Cut to

Frank, prizing back the floor boards. Jones restrains the
Slum Landlord. Lilly watches. Frank pulls the floor boards
away easily. We see that hidden in the floor cavity are
packets of something. Frank pulls them out.

Rips one of the plastic bags open. In it are packets with the
words "Jamestown Borough - Civilian Influenza Vaccination."
Frank holds it up for Lilly to see.

The Slum Landlord is now looking three ways at once.

Lilly slowly begins to approach the Slum Landlord.

                   LILLY
         It is my pleasure to inform you
         that you are under arrest for
         trafficking influenza vaccine.

                   SLUM LANDLORD
         I want my lawyer.

                   LILLY
         This is a violation of the 12/10
         health act, whereby you have
         withheld borough sponsored
         vaccines from your tenants.

                   SLUM LANDLORD
         I want a lawyer!

                   LILLY
         Anything you say will be held
         against you as evidence and, by
         endangering the public good, you
         are not entitled to a lawyer.

The Slum Landlord just stares at her.

                   SLUM LANDLORD
         Fuck you then.

Lilly smiles grimly.
                                                                    15




                       LILLY
             There's only one other thing.

  Lilly gives the Slum Landlord one almighty slap across the
  face that stuns him. Then Jones grabs the Slum Landlord and
  drags him off, but we stay on Lilly. Her face. She stoops and
  lifts something from the landlords desk. A public health
  flier saying "Fight Influenza. Ask your landlord for your
  free vaccine now." Then from the corner of the room, the
  prostitute pipes up, impatiently waving a cigarette at Lilly.

                       PROSTITUTE
             Oi! How about me? He promised me
             some of that. I earned it.

17 INT: POLICE CAR - TWILIGHT                                  17

  Jones is in front, Frank is driving. The car has come to a
  lurching halt. Some kind of cart is blocking the road.

                       FRANK
                    (hitting the horn)
             Come one!

  Jones is eating some kind of pie that is an affront to
  culinary art.

                       JONES
             Lil', you want some?

  Ensconced in the back Lilly shakes her head, no.

                       LILLY
             Smells terrible.

  She is watching the patterns of street lights that play and
  flow over the wet windows of the car. Jones shrugs.

                       JONES
             I'm not letting that scum put me
             off my food. That'd be like a
             moral victory.

                       LILLY
             I'll get out here.

                         FRANK
             You sure?
                                                                      16




   We see Lilly get out. Frank and Jones share a look.

                       FRANK
                    (continuing)
             What's up with her?

   Jones watches Lilly move off; something like compassion
   crosses his features.

                       FRANK
                    (continuing)
             Jones? Is she alright?

                       JONES
             Yeah. Lilly's kid. It died of the
             influenza, didn't it.

                       FRANK
             She's never said anything about a
             kid.

                       JONES
             No. She never says anything.

   Jones stares after Lilly, then starts chomping into his food.


18 EXT: SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUING                             18

   The police car pulls out leaving Lilly outside the subway
   station. Lilly looks exhausted, breathes in deeply. Above,
   power lines blow in the wind and rain and make a clacking
   sound. She moves off and we crane up to see the seething
   smoky city beyond.

20 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               20

   Lilly enters her apartment. It's nice; not opulent, but a
   haven of sorts.

   She stands for a moment in the empty hallway. We see a hall,
   several doors run off it.


20A INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, CHILDS BEDROOM - CONTINUING         20A

   Lilly approaches a room and we see inside it. It is empty
   apart from a stripped bed and some boxes.

   Lilly flips the lid on one of the boxes. She picks up a toy;
   a pink fairy princess with wings, the paint on its face worn.
                                                                    17




  Lilly winds a key and the wings of the doll flutter,
  accompanied by the whining sound of the internal mechanics.

  We see Lilly's face as she stares at the doll. Emotion fights
  to claw its way out from under her skin, but she doesn't let
  it.

  Then in the distance we hear a child's cries. It almost
  sounds like memories wafting through the air, but the
  stamping of feet from the apartment above makes it plain that
  the noises come from there; the sound of children playing.

  Cut to


21 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT                     21

  Lilly enters her bedroom. The place is a mess. She sits on
  the bed. She picks up a framed photo which sits on a
  sideboard next to the bed. It shows Lilly, a man - Lilly's
  age - and a child of 5 years who looks a lot like Lilly. She
  stares at the child. We hear the sound of rain pounding
  against the window of the bedroom.


22 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT                     22

  Pull out to reveal the exterior window. We can see through
  the window into Lilly's apartment again, see Lilly lying
  down, hugging the photo. The rain has become a light mist.


23 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, STREET - NIGHT                         23

  We are close on a poster. It shows a perfect face, serenely
  beaming out; it could be Silus or Augustus, except this man
  is dressed in religious regalia, like a priest. The poster
  says "The Brotherhood loves you. You are divine." We begin to
  crane off the poster which is revealed to be stuck on a lamp
  post. The street is seething, the slums of Jamestown.

  A young boy, perhaps seven; spiked up hair, face
  covered in grime, grime from dragging himself up in this
  hellish place. He carries a bag filled with the detritus he's
  picked from the rubbish bins of the rich. He wears a
  distinctive red t-shirt that is several sizes too big. He
  moves along the street, avoiding a disinterested passersby.
  As he passes an alley he hears something. An animal-like
  growl. He stops.

  Down the alley he can see two figures. One is a male. He is
  clutching another clothed figure; female.

                      KID
            Hey?! Hey!
                                                                    18




  At that instant the man turns to the boy. There, half seen in
  the slick shadows, the most piercing eyes, a bloody mouth,
  with fangs, hissing. The creature drops the woman and scales
  the sheer wall of the alleyway; clutching various handholds,
  up four flights, then gone.

  The kid, frightened, now makes to run off but bangs into a
  passerby. The man grabs the kid roughly.

                      MAN IN THE STREET
            Where are you going in such a
            hurry my little ruffian? Pilfering
            by the look of you?

  The kid struggles and the Man now sees the shape of the woman
  in the alleyway, slumped to the ground.

                      MAN IN THE STREET
                   (continuing)
            What's going on here? What'd you
            do to her?

                      KID
            Don't, I didn't do nothing. It was
            a Brother. It was a Brother did it.

  The man moves forward, dragging the kid. And he sees the
  woman there, deathly white in the alley. Dead eyes staring.

                      MAN IN THE STREET
            Oh dear god...

24 INT: NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DAY                           24

  We track past a sign that says "Museum of Spiritual Selection
  and Alchemistry." In the distance we can see a group of
  people in the hazy light.

  Cut to

  Augustus - the man we saw with Silus earlier - sitting on a
  chair surrounded by various objects. At his feet are a gaggle
  of school children, aged around ten; affluent looking, human.
  Augustus points to a strange, ancient looking glass apparatus.

                      AUGUSTUS
            300 years ago, with these simple
            instruments, the alchemist
            Guiseppi De Angelo discovered what
            we today call genetic science.
                                                                 19




                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            He deciphered that the Brothers
            were a new race of beings, sent by
            god, to serve and protect you.

  We see the faces of the children, rapt.

                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            De Angelo formed the church of the
            Brotherhood. He was a great great
            man, but there were others, bad
            men, who took what De Angelo had
            discovered and experimented
            without concern for the results.
            The science of genetics and all
            its power has been banned ever
            since. Who can tell me what came
            from these bad experiments?

  One child puts his hand up. Behind the child, in the
  distance, Augustus now sees Silus approaching; Silus
  obviously wants to talk to Augustus. Augustus points to the
  child while looking at Silus.

                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            Yes.

                      CHILD
            All the bad things. Like bad germs
            and flu.

  Augustus nods, watching Silus' ominous expression.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Yes. That's right.

  Augustus looks at the child and tries to smile.

                      AUGUSTUS
                   (continuing)
            All the bad things.


25 EXT: SLUM, STREET - DAY                                  25

  The streets are wet. High above several large Zeppelins plod
  across the sky. We crane down to street level to find a
  police car pulling up through the steam. Lilly gets out,
  Jones beside her, wolfing down another bun.
                                                                    20




  There are cops everywhere. An alleyway is cordoned off. The
  dwellers of the slum have floated up and are baying like
  wolves, hassling the cops; some yell obscenities, generally
  along the lines of "where's the police when you need them?"
  Jones stares at the people.

                      JONES
            Someone should flatten this
            cesspool and start again.

  Lilly and Jones move towards the police cordon. Immediately
  a reporter accosts them.

                      STREET REPORTER
            Marm? The Tribune. Do you have any
            comments on the death?

                      LILLY
            No.

                      STREET REPORTER
            They're saying it was a Brother,
            is that true?

  Lilly stares at the reporter, pauses for thought. She
  whistles to one of the cops nearby, who then approaches.

                      LILLY
            Arrest her.

  Jones and Lilly push past as the reporter protests at being
  manhandled.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing; to Jones)
            Find any witnesses and shut them
            up.

  Jones nods and moves over to a policeman guarding the alley.
  Lilly ducks under the crime scene tape, moving into the alley.


26 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - DAY                         26

  The alleyway is full of forensics personnel. Lilly moves
  deeper into the alleyway. We see her POV moving forward,
  finally revealing the body of the young woman who is
  surrounded by various forensics staff. Lilly talks to one.

                      LILLY
            Can I step in?

                      FORENSIC GUY
            With the traffic. What's it matter.
                                                               21




Lilly moves forward. She can now see the woman more clearly.
The woman is obviously dead; her pale white skin like wet
shining alabaster in the dark alley. Flashes from
photographic machines light the scene, almost blinding Lilly
and briefly revealing the true horror of the scene.

Lilly kneels and carefully begins to examine the body.

Another man now walks up and kneels next to Lilly; young,
good looking, obviously takes pride in himself.

                     DOMINIC
         Lil'.

                   LILLY
         Hello Dominic.

                   DOMINIC
         Have you seen it?

Dominic bends down and moves the dead woman's head,
displaying the side of her neck. A bite has torn the skin on
the side of her neck. The wound extends down, the carotid
artery sliced in two.

                   DOMINIC
                (continuing)
         It's a bite. If you know what I
         mean?

Lilly nods, then looks down at the woman's dead, cockeyed
stare. Lilly closes the woman's eyes.

                   LILLY
         Any identification?

She is passed a bloody ID. Lilly stares at it.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Tanya Garfield.

Jones now arrives.

                   JONES
                (to forensics team)
         Where do you get a cup of tea
         around here?

No one answers. Jones shrugs.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         There's a kid who saw it, down
         there.
                                                               22




Lilly sees the red shirted street urchin in the distance
being talked to by two uniformed policemen.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Says it was a Brother. And they've
         got another fellow, that's all who
         saw it.

Lilly nods.

                   LILLY
         Alright, we'll close this down
         gents. None of you are to say a
         word, not even to your old mother.

All the police officers stare at her; they know what she
means alright.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Jones. Make sure.

Jones shrugs and nods. Lilly gets up and moves towards the
street kid who is being talked to by two burly, grumpy
policemen. The boy is shaking.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         He saw what happened?

                   POLICEMAN 1
         Now he wont talk. Didn't see
         anything.

Lilly looks at the boy. So young.

                   LILLY
         What's your name?

The kid doesn't answer and gets a whack around the ears from
one of the policemen.

                   LILLY
                (continuing; to the
                 policeman)
         Stop that.

Lilly stares at the kid, as if the way he looks has keyed a
memory in her. She squats and looks him straight in the eye.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         What's your name then?
                                                               23




                   KID
                (nervous)
         Albert.

                   LILLY
         You live around here?

The kid looks nervous. Lilly moves some of the bedraggled
hair out of the kid's eyes.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         I grew up 3 streets from here.
         Matheson Lane. The Skrummers
         Workhouse.

                   KID
                (surprised)
         You did?

                   LILLY
         Or should I say, I crawled out of
         here.

The kid smiles. Lilly focuses on him now.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         No one else will do anything about
         this, you know? They just think
         this is a slum. No one really
         cares what happens to the people
         here. Except for you. And me.

The kid stares at her; she's a magician and he's a believer.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         What did you see?

                   KID
         A man.

                   LILLY
         What kind of man?

                   KID
         A Brother.

                   LILLY
         You're sure it was a Brother?

                   KID
         He had teeth and everything.
                                                                    24




                      LILLY
            Where did he go?

  The kid turns and points to the shear wall of the alley.

                      KID
            He went straight up there.

  Lilly stares at the wall.

                      LILLY
            Alright, you go with these men,
            they'll look after you. I promise.

  She rises.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing; to the
                    Policemen)
            Get him to describe it all. And
            keep him away from everyone.

  The Policemen grunt and begin to lead the kid off.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing; to the
                    Policemen)
            And get him some food.

  Jones, now standing next to Lilly, moans.

                      JONES
            Now they'll all want feeding.

  Lilly looks at Jones's callous face; she's not amused.

27 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, BUILDING ABOVE ALLEYWAY - CONTINUING   27

  High angle POV of Lilly and Jones moving off. Someone is
  watching them from the roof above. The POV belongs to Silus,
  who stares down at them. In particular he watches Lilly. We
  see Lilly pause and then look up as if feeling she's watched.

  We see Lilly's POV of the building above. There is no one
  there.

  HA of Lilly looking up.

28 INT: POLICE STATION, HOWARD ANDERSON'S OFFICE - LATER      28

  A device flies toward the camera, sharp needles eject from it
  slamming into skin.

  Seated at the desk is a harassed, balding man (ANDERSON)of
  about 55. He's just finished vaccinating himself, wincing at
  the needle jabs on the soft skin of his arm. There are many
  other needle marks on his skin.

                        LILLY
                     (off)
              I've quarantined the neighborhood.

  Lilly stands before the man's large desk, which is lit by
  only a desk lamp.

                        LILLY
                     (continuing)
              As far as anyone knows we have a
              new influenza outbreak.

                        ANDERSON
              What about the telephonic
              companies?

                        LILLY
              They're cooperating, closing all
              phone lines in and out except
              directly to us.

  Anderson nods.

                          ANDERSON
              Sit, sit.

  She does.

                        ANDERSON
                     (continuing)
              You've done well Lilly. The
              reporter is more of a problem. We
              have 2 days by law before we have
              to release her. Then it's out.

  Anderson lays down the medi kit and stares at it as he
  motions for her to sit. She does.

                        ANDERSON
                     (continuing)
              I hate these things. I'm like a
              pin cushion.

                        LILLY
              It's better than the alternative,
              sir.
                                                                  26




  Anderson stares at her; a moment of tension.

                      ANDERSON
            I need you to stay with this,
            Lilly. You know Jamestown better
            than anyone, how to handle the
            people.

  Lilly acknowledges the compliment.

                      ANDERSON
                   (continuing)
            The Brothers have requested to be
            involved with the investigation.

                      LILLY
            That's nice for them.

                      ANDERSON
            You have a problem with it?

                      LILLY
            Not particularly.

                      ANDERSON
            Good. I think they can help. And
            I don't want someone working on
            this whose got something against
            the Church.

                      LILLY
            How do you know I don't?

                      ANDERSON
            Lilly, you're the least prejudiced
            person I know. In fact, you're the
            only one I know. That's important.
            The church is powerful, but more
            than that, people's faith in the
            Brotherhood is about all they've
            got these days. And the government
            knows it. Even the Queen herself
            is involved. This is political.

29 INT: POLICE STATION, COMMUNAL OFFICE - DAY               29

  Lilly enters, drinking a coffee. She begins to top it up from
  the coffee stand when Jones comes up to her.

                      JONES
            Lil'. He's here.
                                                                    27




  Lilly's expression becomes taut. She peers towards her
  office. She can clearly see an exceptionally well dressed man
  in her office with his back to us. It is Silus. A young
  female cop - Steph - is in there and we can see her kissing
  a ring on Silus' hand and Silus placing his hand on her head
  as if blessing her.

  Steph then exits the office and approaches Lilly and Jones;
  her face is flushed with excitement.

                      STEPH
            Do you know who he is? That's
            Brother Silus. They say one day he
            will lead the Brotherhood. He's a
            great man.

                      JONES
            I think I hear choir music.

  Steph flashes Jones a resentful look.

                      STEPH
            Do you respect anything?

                      JONES
            Hey. My old mum goes to church
            four times a week and gives blood.
            She's happy as a lark. Just don't
            expect me to kiss him, that's all
            I'm telling you.

  Cut to


30 INT: POLICE STATION, LILLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS            30

  Close on the enigmatic ring on Silus' finger.

  We see Lilly is seated on one side of her desk, Silus on the
  other. Lilly is staring at the ring, then she studies a
  Photostat in front of her. There is a picture of a man, a
  rather perfect looking man.

                      LILLY
            Senior Brother Edgar... How long
            have you known about this?

  Silus opposite Lilly, his perfect, serene appearance an
  anathema in the grunge of the Jamestown police station. He
  watches her very carefully, listens to the way her finger
  taps the sheet in front of her, the sound of her chair
  swiveling, all the sounds very acute to him; she has a
  physical ease about her.
                                                                28




                   SILUS
         A matter of weeks.

Lilly smiles.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         Is there something wrong?

Lilly stops smiling. For the first time she is still.

                   LILLY
         Yes. Withholding evidence.
         Covering up two murders. And no
         one's worried. If me or one of the
         people in Jamestown did that
         they'd be in the hell house with
         the key thrown away. It seems the
         church is able to do whatever it
         wants.

Silus nods.

                   SILUS
         You're right to not like it. It is
         political.

Lilly becomes more interested at this; at the bald honesty of
the statement.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         We thought we could find Brother
         Edgar ourselves. We were wrong.
         But now any debate is pointless.

Lilly stares at him. There is already something between them
even though they stand on opposite sides of a huge gulf. She
nods, accepting his point.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         The greatest danger is if this
         were to become public knowledge.

                   LILLY
         Wouldn't want anyone criticizing
         the church I suppose.

                   SILUS
         It's more than that Captain. This
         is about prejudice, or rather the
         nature of it. As a female surely
         you would understand.
                                                                 29




                      LILLY
            Really.

                      SILUS
            How many other Captains in this
            borough are female?

                      LILLY
            None?

                      SILUS
            How are your actions judged, the
            same or differently from the men.

  Lilly stares at Silus; he is an incredible being.

                      LILLY
            Differently.

                      SILUS
            Exactly. If a white man kills,
            then he is just a killer. If a
            black man kills, then all black
            men are suspect. That is the
            nature of prejudice. Those who are
            different are grouped together. If
            only one Brother does a bad thing
            then all Brothers are suspect,
            because we are different. And then
            what would this world be like, if
            there was no hope?

  Lilly nods, acknowledging the truth of it.

                      LILLY
            Alright then. So what do you
            suggest?

                      SILUS
            First, there is something you
            should hear.

  Cut to


31 INT: POLICE STATION, BRIEFING ROOM - LATER               31

  Scummy, large briefing room. There are seven cops in here,
  perched on desks and chairs. Jones, Dominic, Frank plus four
  others. Lilly is also there. So is Silus, sitting, perfectly
  still, calm. Several of the cops look at him suspiciously.
                                                                30




                   LILLY
         Ok, ok, quiet down.

Everyone nods and shuts up as Lilly stands in front of the
men.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Gentlemen, there's no other way to
         put it. We have only 2 days to
         find the suspect.

There are guffaws from most of the policemen.

                   JONES
         There's no chance. Not a hope in
         hell.

                   FRANK
         He's right. We don't even know
         where to begin.

                   LILLY
         Quiet!

Lilly is angry. There is silence in the room. Lilly seems
more angry than she should be.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         What you are about to hear will
         not leave this room. Everyone
         understand? Jones?

Jones shrugs.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         I would suggest anyone with a weak
         stomach leave now.

No one moves. They all stare at Lilly.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         This is Brother Silus.

She motions to Silus, who rises, watching the glares from the
cops who eye him like a suspect.

                   SILUS
         Thank you Captain. Could we have
         the plate?
                                                                31




An old slide projector heats up as the main lights are turned
off. The projector sprays an image up on the wall. The face
of a killer, before he became one, the serene gaze of a
Brother.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         Senior Brother Edgar. Until 3
         weeks ago, he was a trusted and
         talented theologian and scientist.

                   DOMINIC
         What'd he do?

                   SILUS
         He was personally responsible for
         developing the most recent
         influenza antivirals. It is
         because of him that most of you
         are alive today. His behavior
         appeared normal. Next.

3 photos come up. The victims.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         The victims. John Anderson. Julie
         Danes. Tanya Garfield. All in
         their early 20's, but beyond that
         no obvious connection. Next.

A Map.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         There is no precedent for Brother
         Edgar's behavior. No Brother has
         ever taken a human life, not in
         the 300 years since we began. Not
         one. Our role has been to preserve
         and maintain the human life. Not
         take it.

                   JONES
         Next he'll be wanting an fucking
         medal.

Silus stares directly at Jones now. Their eyes lock. Silus
continues, perfectly calm.

                   SILUS
         What I am saying to you is that
         Brother Edgar's behavior is
         aberrant. We
                                                                32

                        SILUS
                        (cont)
         don't understand it. And therefore
         it's difficult to predict. The
         only thing we know is where he
         will strike next.

                   DOMINIC
         How do you know?

Silus moves to the desk next to him. He passes something to
another cop who now sits at the desk. We see Lilly now. The
look on her face tells us that she knows what is coming and
she's not looking forward to it.

We see what Silus gave the cop. An audio tape. The cop places
the tape in a tape deck. He then switches it on. He then
turns the volume knob on an amplifier which now directs
static hiss to two big speakers.

We see the faces of the cops, all listening in the dim light
coming from the slide projector.

Above the level of the hissing tape there is another noise.
It is a wet sound. Like a cat would make if it were lapping
up milk. An another sound. Like an animal, moaning with
pleasure.

We see the cops; some of them are beginning to twig. And
there is another noise. It is a man; moaning.

                   MAN ON THE TAPE
                (off)
         Please. Please don't hurt me.

We see Jones and Dominic. Their glares say it all. And then
another voice.

                     EDGAR
                  (off, like to a lover)
         Quiet.

                   MAN ON THE TAPE
                (off)
         Please...

                   EDGAR
                (off)
         I said shut up!

Then we hear a punch and then noises which can only be
described as sounding like a dog killing something.

Jones springs out of his seat.
                                                                33




                   JONES
         Fuck!

                   LILLY
         Jones, sit down.

                   JONES
         Why are we listening to this?!

                   LILLY
         Quiet!

Jones stands there enraged. Dominic pulls him down back into
his chair. All the cops are appalled by what they have heard.
And then a voice.

                   EDGAR
                (off)
         Good. Now you're quiet.

We can hear Edgar moving around.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing; off)
         Did you hear that Silus? I hope so.

We see Silus, listening as intently as everyone else.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing; off)
         The next one will be tomorrow.
         There is a square, Bridge Square
         it's called. I will take the next
         one from there. You should try
         harder this time. Please try
         harder...

More moving around, then the sound on the tape cuts out. We
are left with only tape hiss. Everyone stares at Silus.

                   FRANK
         He sent this to you. Specifically.

                   SILUS
         We share the same mother. There is
         a bond.

The cops all stare at Silus' emotionless response.

                   LILLY
         There will be two teams. Frank, I
         want you and Abernathy up in the
         buildings around Bridge Square.

Frank nods.
                                                                   34




                      LILLY
                   (continuing)
            I'll lead the other team with
            Dominic, Jones and Queen's
            Imperial Guard in support. No
            guns, batons only.

                        JONES
            What?

                      LILLY
            You heard me. He's to be taken
            alive.


32 EXT: JAMESTOWN, BRIDGE SQUARE - NIGHT                      32

  It has rained. The small square is dimly lit. At it's center
  is a small park with distorted trees. And a rundown
  playground. A rusty swing creaks. We see a figure there. It
  is Lilly. She watches the rusty swing creak. Then she looks
  up to the surrounding buildings.

  We tilt up to one of the buildings which is perhaps eight
  stories high; like the others around the square it is an
  apartment building. There is movement at the very top.

  Cut to


33 EXT: JAMESTOWN, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOF - NIGHT                33

  POV from the top of the building, observing Lilly below enter
  a black, unmarked van. Then there is buzz from an RT. We
  reveal POV belongs to Silus.

                        SILUS
            Yes.


34 INT: POLICE VAN - NIGHT                                    34

  Lilly is in a police van. Jones and Dominic are there with
  her; both of them trying to come to grips with the strange
  stun weapons they've been given. And there are three huge,
  dark eyed soldiers there, dressed in the ominous black
  uniform of the Queen's Imperial Guard, cocking their electric
  batons; which fizz in the half light.

                        LILLY
            Anything?

  We cut between Lilly in the van and Silus on the roof.
                                                                 35




                      SILUS
            No.

  Silus surveys the scene. He can see an Imperial Guard sniper
  over the square on the roof of a building. Below, in the
  street, we can see the silhouettes of several Brothers;
  unmoving, watchful sentinels.

                      LILLY
            It's getting late.

                      SILUS
            He will come.

                      LILLY
            Ok. We'll sit tight.

  Lilly closes the com. Jones is staring at her.

                      JONES
            This is a dud.

  Lilly ignores Jones and talks into the RT again.

                      LILLY
            Frank?

  Cut to


35 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE - NIGHT           35

  Frank is inspecting a stairwell of the building. He has
  Abernathy with him. He talks into his RT.

                      FRANK
            Yeah Lil'.

                      LILLY
                   (off)
            Anything?

                      FRANK
            Not a thing.

                      LILLY
                   (off)
            Check each floor again.

  Frank motions to Abernathy, who is already sighing.
                                                                    36




                      FRANK
            You heard her. Once more for the
            empire.

  Low Angle from the floor of the two men beginning to climb
  the stairs, their guns out.

  The shot stays where it is. We can see the stairs and the
  wall. We pause. The soundtrack is almost dead quiet, apart
  from the buzzing flouro above us. And then the CAMERA begins
  to advance, like a POV, heading for the wall ahead. It
  reaches the corner and then advances along cables running up
  to the roof. As it climbs we can see a ventilation shaft in
  the corner with no grill. The camera approaches it and moves
  into the shaft, continuous.


36 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, VENTILATION SHAFT - CONTINUOUS     36

  The shot continues to track through the man-sized shaft. As
  we move through the shaft - turning corners, going up
  floors - we pass grills. Some of them show light coming from
  the apartments within. We can hear an argument in one room.
  A crying child in the next. A TV blaring in another (playing
  porno). But mostly the rooms are dark. And as we move up and
  along, there is a scuttling NOISE, growing louder, as if we
  are approaching it.

  Then the NOISE stops.

  The camera halts, stares down the long ventilation shaft.
  Silence. Dead silence. The camera starts to move again and
  then turns a corner to run into the leering face of Edgar,
  the vampire, his teeth bared, his eyes reflecting in the half
  light. Then he smiles.

                      EDGAR
            Shoo.

  Cut to

  A rat, staring back at Edgar. The rat turns and streaks off
  back whence it came.

  A slight smile appears on Edgar's face; a smile that can
  chill the blood in your veins.

  Then he begins to move forward. We hear his breathing; low,
  but excited. He moves with the precision and strength of an
  insect. His eyes glisten and reflect light like an animal's.
  His skin is flesh white and milky in the metal shaft.

  Cut to
                                                                    37




  His POV approaching a grill. A subdued light comes through
  it. The POV approaches and sees into the apartment below.


37 INT: ROOM, SAME BUILDING - NIGHT                            37

  A woman, around 20, attractive, brushing her hair. She has
  just had a shower. She sits.

  Cut to

  The shaft. We see Edgar's hand enter shot. His hand grips the
  bottom of the grill and tries to open it. It doesn't budge.

  Cut to

  Inside the room, the woman turns and looks up at the grill.
  She thinks she's heard something. She stares; waits. She gets
  up and moves towards the grill high above on the wall. She
  places a chair under it, then gets up on it, standing on tip
  toes, trying to see if there's anything behind the grill. Her
  hand reaches out and tries the grill, to see if it's secure.

  Then she leans closer to it. Her face pressed right up
  against it. Closer. Closer.

  Cut to

  Edgar's white face, lurching into shot. Staring, staring.

  Cut to

  His POV. He is now looking through a different grill. This
  time there is a young man inside an apartment. Doing
  exercises.

  Edgar watches. And again that chilling smile.

  We see the man again, who gets up and preens himself in front
  of a mirror.

  Close on Edgar's eyes, devouring the sight of this pumped up
  flesh. The young man exits the room, going into a bathroom.

  We see Edgar's hand trying to open the grill. It moves.

  Cut to


38 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, HALL - NIGHT                       38

  Frank and Abernathy are on fifth floor, finishing a sweep of
  it. As they move they hear a CRASH. They stop. Then another
  crash, coming from the floor up. Then a SCREAM.
                                                                      38




   They look at each other, then begin to run to the stairwell,
   as Frank talks into his RT.

                       FRANK
             Lil'! Lil'!

   Cut to


38A INT: POLICE VAN - CONTINUING                                38A

                         LILLY
             Frank.

                       FRANK
                    (off)
             He's on the sixth floor! He's on
             the sixth floor!

                         LILLY
             Let's go.

   Everyone fires into action and begins to exit the van.


39 EXT: JAMESTOWN, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOF - NIGHT                  39

   Silus watches from his vantage point. He can see Lilly and
   her team below rushing into the building adjacent to him. And
   then he sees, through one of the windows on the sixth floor,
   the flashes of gunfire.

   Cut to


40 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIR WELL - NIGHT                  40

   Handheld camera with Lilly and her crew rushing up the
   stairwell; up up.

   Cut to


41 OMITTED                                                      41


42 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, HALL - NIGHT         42

   Lilly and her crew entering the hall. They are confronted
   with a view of the long hall. Halfway down there is a door
   with blood smeared on it. We can see Abernathy, lying in a
   pool of blood outside the door.
                                                                    39




  The cops stop. A door opens close to them. A large greasy man
  pokes his head out the door and gets the cops guns on him
  immediately. Lilly motions with her hand.

                      LILLY
                   (whispering)
            Police. Get back inside. Get back.

  The man returns and closes the door. The Imperial Guards now
  swing into action. They move forward towards the room, to the
  closed door. Lilly and her crew follow. The Imperial Guards
  get ready outside the door batons ready. One of them motions
  for Lilly and her crew to wait. Jones is nearest them. He
  goes down on one knee. Dominic moves past them and positions
  himself on the other side.

  Lilly kneels where she is.

  Beat.

  Then the Imperial Guards kick open the door and enter.

  Lilly waits, watching. There's no sound. Dominic begins to
  move forward, then enter the door to the apartment, his baton
  raised. Jones now moves forward, keeping his eyes on the
  door. There is no sound coming from the room.

  Cut to

  Lilly, kneeling in the hall. Also staring at the door. Too
  late to realize the door next to her is opening. Before she
  can react, she's staring into the face of Edgar; the eyes,
  the bloody mouth. Edgar is on her in an instant, moving with
  ferocious speed, whipping her like a rag doll into the room.

  Meanwhile Jones is edging towards the room Dominic entered.

  Cut to


43 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOM - NIGHT        43

  Lilly, trapped, held by Edgar, who stares at her. Then, in
  one swift movement, he lurches down, tearing her neck with
  his teeth. She cries out.


44 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, HALL - NIGHT        44

  In the hall, Jones is looking into the room Dominic went
  into. The lights come on. The room is empty. Just the cops
  and Frank's bloody corpse on the floor.

                      JONES
            Lil'.
                                                                   40




  Jones turns to see Lilly, but she's not there. The hallway is
  empty. He sees the door Lilly was pulled through. Then looks
  down. Blood is seeping from under the door.

                        JONES
                     (continuing)
            Fuck!

  Cut to


45 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, BRIDGE SQUARE, ROOM - NIGHT       45

  Lilly being embraced by Edgar, she can't do anything. Then a
  loud crash on the door, as if someone is trying to break in.
  Edgar stops feeding, stares at Lilly.

  Beat.

                      EDGAR
            You're so strong.

  Then another crash on the door. Edgar drops Lilly. He propels
  himself towards a ventilation grill on the wall.

  Cut to

  Jones and the cops kicking the door in. It swings open to
  show Lilly on the floor. Jones stoops down.

                       JONES
            Lilly!

  Jones gets close to Lilly, starts squeezing the side of her
  neck, trying to stop the arterial blood from squirting her
  life away.

                      JONES
                   (continuing)
            Oh shit shit.

  Dominic enters and sees the scene. He yells into his RT.

                      DOMINIC
            Lilly's hurt. She's hurt!

  The other cops are now scanning the room. Meanwhile Dominic
  has found the ventilation shaft, blood smeared around the
  opening.

                      DOMINIC
                   (continuing)
            He's in the ventilation shaft!
                                                                  41




Jones then stares down at Lilly pressing one hand against the
wound. Close on Lilly, going into shock. She's shivering.

                   JONES
         She's dying! She's fucking dying!

At that moment SILUS appears at the door.

Silus stares at Lilly, bleeding to death in Jones' arms.
Silus immediately bends to her. With his free hand Jones
pulls out a vicious knife which he points at Silus.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Get away from her!

But Silus ignores the knife and moves closer to Lilly.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Get away or I'll stick you!

                   SILUS
         Do you want me to save her?

Jones wavers.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         She is dying.

Jones backs the knife away. Silus whips   his hand to the blade
of the knife, slashing his wrist, blood   immediately issuing
from the wound. He presses his bleeding   wrist to Lilly's
mouth. At first resistant, Lilly begins   to suck at the wrist.
Jones is appalled.

Silus then leans close to Lilly and whispers in her ear. All
the other noises in the soundtrack drop out.

                   SILUS
                (continuing)
         Lilly. Stop fighting now. Fall
         back, fall back...

Slowly she does. Silus removes his wrist from Lilly's mouth.
She is silent, comatose.

A medical team now scramble through the door, pushing past
Silus and the bloody Jones and begin to work on Lilly. For a
moment Silus and Jones stare at each other. Then Silus turns
to the ventilation shaft in the corner. He closes his eyes.
Listens.
                      42




          DOMINIC
He's getting away!!

         SILUS
Quiet.
                                                                      43




   The cops are silent. Stare at Silus who opens his eyes.

                       SILUS
                    (continuing)
             He's going up.

   We move in on Silus' ear. Closer, closer. Into his ear.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:


46 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT           46

   The long shaft and in the distance Edgar approaching, his
   eyes reflective, moving with the speed of an insect through
   the shaft, his bloody mouth.

   Cut to

   Silus, now also in the shaft, his gun out, moving forward. He
   turns a corner. The shaft is empty. He waits, watching,
   listening. He hears a scuffling.

   Cut to

   Edgar, the same, turning a corner to see Silus approaching
   him. Silus raises his gun. A puff emits from the end of his
   gun. The projectile hurtles towards Edgar, who just ducks out
   of the way in time.

   Edgar turns. There is a grill next to him. He smashes it with
   his foot.

   Cut to

   Silus approaching the junction, turning the corner, just in
   time to see Edgar's legs pass through the hole.


46A INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, HALL - CONTINUING                  46A

   We see Jones move into the hall, looking at the roof,
   searching. Then he looks at Lilly's blood which covers his
   hands. He pockets his stun weapon and pulls out his own
   dangerous looking gun.

   Cut to


47 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, DIFFERENT FLOOR - NIGHT             47

   A door bursts open. Edgar - in slow motion - crashes through
   the door and into the hall. The sound track is a huge driving
   slab of choral orchestral music.
                                                                    44




  The camera tracks back as he starts to mount the wall, his
  momentum carrying him diving towards the camera.

  Cut to

  Silus enters the empty hall. No Edgar. Then he sees in the
  roof, a manhole cover, slightly ajar.

  Cut to


48 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, CEILING CAVITY - NIGHT             48

  Silus' POV as he climbs into the crawl space, its ceiling
  following the pitch of the roof. It is dark and extends for
  a long way. Silus squats in the sub light like a beautifully
  dressed animal.

  What he can't see are two blinking eyes above him in the
  rafters of the dark roof. It is Edgar. Edgar drops, Silus
  turns too late as the weight of Edgar drives into him,
  sending both of them through the floor of the ceiling cavity
  and down...


49 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, ANOTHER HALL - NIGHT               49

  ...to fall, a dead weight, crashing down onto the floor of
  the hall in a hail of debris. Edgar is on top of Silus and
  strangling him, and then he stops and turns.

  He moves just in time to avoid a bullet from Jones' gun which
  glances Edgar's cheek, sending off a wisp of burnt colored
  smoke.

  Cut to

  Jones. Gun smoking, standing at the other end of the hall.

  Edgar screams the scream of something from the animal
  kingdom. Then turns and runs.

  Cut to

  Silus rising, pulling out his gun. Jones points his gun, but
  Silus is obscuring his view.

  Cut to

  Edgar runs away down the hall.

  Then on Silus. Very still, very silent. Close on his finger
  pressing the trigger.
                                                                45




The camera zooms right into the interior of the gun to see
the projectile entering the gun's chamber and the hammer
igniting it.

The projectile explodes out the end of the gun.

High Angle of the projectile flying towards its target, the
ceiling lights above streaking past on its reflective
surface, cruel mechanical claws suddenly slide out from the
side of the capsule.

Then Edgar, camera tracking back at high speed.

Slow move in on Silus' cool gray eyes.

Then whack! The projectile stabs into Edgar's back, the claws
springing forward to hook onto Edgar's flesh, we see the
fluid within the transparent projectile flow into Edgar, see
Edgar's eyes widen, see his POV of the approaching window
then...

Crash. Edgar's head implants itself in the wall below the
window, the dust and debris from the wall board drifting over
Edgar's numb stare.

In the background Silus stands. Motionless.

We see Jones walking forward, gun still pointing, heading
towards Edgar. Silus turns and steps in front of him.

                   JONES
         Get out of my way.

                   SILUS
         No.

Jones stares at Silus and contemplates firing.

                   JONES
         He killed Lilly.

Silus doesn't move. He stares calmly at Jones.

Jones points the gun in Silus' face.

Beat.

                    JONES
                 (continuing)
         Bang.
                                                                     46




   Jones lowers his gun. We end close on Silus' serene face.

                                            SLOW DISSOLVE

   Black. Voices in the dark, quiet at first, then growing more
   frightening; then the hint of a face, in negative - Edgar -
   then screams, like the screams of an animal on the hunt. And
   another face, alternating with Edgar's. Silus.

                                            CUT TO:


51 INT: HOSPITAL, LILLY'S WARD - DAY                           51

   High Angle of Lilly asleep, lying on a hospital bed. We drift
   down. Again there is rain, pounding against the window. Her
   body flinches; she is in a dream, a nightmare. As we drift
   closer to her, her eyes open, staring straight up and then to
   the left. Then grim recognition.

   Cut to Low Angle on Silus standing above her, examining the
   tube that runs a clear fluid into her in a slow drip.

                       LILLY
             Antibiotics. They say it's like an
             animal bite.

   Silus nods. He slowly sits on the bed.

                       LILLY
                    (continuing)
             I want to thank you.

                       SILUS
             We all caught Edgar.

                       LILLY
             I don't mean that. The blood, they
             say it saved my life. Is it true
             that people who go to church are
             given your blood?

                       SILUS
             Sometimes the rituals call for it.
             Some say they have visions from
             it. That it restores their health.
                                                               47




Silus regards her and she him. She reaches out and touches
his hand, almost retracts at the smooth texture of the skin.

                   LILLY
         So smooth.

She turns over his hand to reveal the wrist; the scars are
almost gone from where Silus cut himself.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Healed already.

                   SILUS
         In some ways my body is like a
         human embryo. The cells regenerate
         quickly. It is why we live so
         long. Will someone come for you?
         Your family?

She releases his hand.

                   LILLY
         I don't have one. Not any more.

                   SILUS
         I see.

                   LILLY
         Influenza. My husband was quick.
         But my daughter, Mary, her little
         body fought it for a long time. So
         I just waited. Hoped. But then you
         realize how cruel hope is. And you
         just want it to end. Not to stop
         her suffering, but to stop my own.

                   SILUS
         I am sorry.

                   LILLY
         Do we seem pathetic to you?

                   SILUS
         No. Fragile. Worn down by nature.
         But you fight back.
                                                                      48




                       LILLY
             Yes. We're good at that.

   Lilly stares up into Silus' serene face. Silus smiles. Then
   stands.

                       SILUS
             I think yours will be a good life
             to watch, Lilly. Goodbye.

   Lilly tries to smile as Silus turns and walks off down the
   ward.

   Close on Lilly who looks grim. Then she turns to the window.
   Rain again, blowing hard against the pane.


52 INT: HOSPITAL,LILLY'S WARD - CONTINUOUS                      52

   As Silus leaves the ward he passes Jones, who's been standing
   there as if he's been watching them. A beat. Then Jones
   shoves a newspaper into Silus' hands.

                       JONES
             Nicely done. You're more human
             than I thought.

   Jones unceremoniously pushes past Silus and moves into
   Lilly's room. Silus reads the newspaper. The story tells of
   the recent deaths in Jamestown, explaining that it was an
   insane man who thought he was a Brother. The man's picture is
   shown; it is actually one of the victims.

   Through the window in the doorway Silus watches Jones
   approach Lilly. We are close on his enigmatic face.

                                              DISSOLVE TO:


52A EXT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, FOYER - DAY- Establisher         52A

   We tilt down a grand building.
                                                                    49




53 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, FOYER - DAY                      53

  A huge foyer, shinning marble floors. All done in perfect
  taste. We see Silus cross the foyer and enter an elevator.
  The elevator doors close.


54 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - DAY      54

  Silus enters the room. There are several technicians at work
  at a console; again the organic nouveaux stylings of the
  Brothers. Augustus is also there. Next to him, someone who is
  obviously human. His lack of perfection stands out; the
  balding hair, dark rings under his eyes. Silus joins them.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Silus. You know Professor Liepsky.

  Silus shakes the Professor's hand. We see the hands touching,
  then slide apart with a wisping sound that makes the
  Professor wince a little.

                      SILUS
            How is he?

                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
            See for yourself.

  He taps one of the men at the console on the shoulder. The
  man hits a button and we see that in front of the console
  there is a huge glass window and beyond it a room which is
  now lit.

  Edgar is in there. And Edgar is not pleased. Even from here
  his glowering stare penetrates everyone in the room. From
  this distance we can't make out much, beyond the fact that
  Edgar is seated in a chair, in an otherwise plain white room.
  Around his chair is a strange "brace" of sorts, that seems to
  be holding Edgar in place.

                      SILUS
            Is the brace necessary?

                      AUGUSTUS
            He decapitated a guard as they
            brought him in. Even though he was
            sedated. He said he will drink us
            all dry.

                      SILUS
            Insane then.
                                                                    50




                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
            Not quite.

  Silus now turns to the Professor.

                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                   (continuing)
            He's become infected.

                      SILUS
            With what?

  The Professor looks to Augustus, as if worried he's said to
  much.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Go on, Brother Silus will soon be
            part of the inner circle of the
            Brotherhood. He should know this.

  Cut to


55 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, LABS - CONTINUING                55

  POV approaching a curved, glass and metal door. On the door
  we see the words "Biological Containment Area."

                                           DISSOLVE TO:


56 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, BIO CONTAINMENT WARD -           56
   DAY- Establisher

  POV continues. There are 3 beds in here. In them, strapped
  down, 3 young woman. They are all insane, monstrous; the
  whites of their eyes are blood red.

  We see Silus observe them, but there is no horror in his
  eyes, just compassion. He moves to one of the woman and
  slowly grasps her hand. She lurches towards him.

                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
            If she wasn't restrained she would
            try to kill you. Don't worry, it's
            only transmissible through their
            blood. We designed it that way.

  Silus quietly turns to the Professor.

                        SILUS
            Designed?
                                                              51




                   PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
         Genetically designed. Edgar was
         experimenting with the virus that
         created you. It was sanctioned by
         the government.

                   SILUS
         Since when do they sanction such
         things?

                   PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
         Since not one Brother has been
         born in 70 years. And never a
         female of your kind from which we
         could breed. And we need to breed
         more Brothers. You give the world
         hope. To the people you're like
         gods walking the earth.

                   AUGUSTUS
         This is what Edgar was doing
         Silus. Trying to genetically
         control the birth of Brothers.

Silus is now turns back to the poor creature on the bed.

                   PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
         And Edgar was successful. Each of
         these women carried a Brother, for
         a time. But, the virus... changed.
         Most of them have died and these
         will die soon.

Silus places his hand on the poor creature's head, blessing
her.

                   PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                (continuing)
         And Edgar may be the first Brother
         to ever die.
                                                                    52




                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                   (continuing)
            Before that, his brain will wither
            like these women. Containment will
            be the issue.

                   (off)
            The police officer. Lilly. Did he
            infect her with this?

                      PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                   (off)
            No. She was lucky. But it is in
            Edgar's blood. It always will be.

  ...and another door in front of Silus clicks, then slides
  open to reveal...


58 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL - CONTINUING                58

  Edgar, sitting in the chair. He immediately turns to the
  door, his eyes burrowing straight into Silus.

  Silus moves forward. We track, Silus' POV, toward Edgar and
  the reality of his predicament is revealed.

  There are metal rods extending from the cage around him. Two
  at the sides. Two from the front. They strategically pointed
  at Edgar's chest and sides. If he was to try to get up, they
  would pierce him.

                      SILUS
            Hello my Brother.

  We can now see Edgar for the first time in something
  approaching a normal state. He looks similar to Silus,
  perhaps not quite so perfect. He radiates confident primeval
  power; less a man captured than an animal waiting. Edgar is
  smiles. He shifts a little, we see the rods piercing his
  flesh.
                                                             53




                   EDGAR
         Do you like what they've done for
         me Silus?

He moves again, as if enjoying it.

                   SILUS
         You are sick. We will help you if
         we can.

                   EDGAR
         Help me? I am being what I was
         meant to be. How can you help me
         from that? Or do you want to tame
         me? Brainwash me? Animal or
         vegetable, are those the two
         choices, Silus?

Edgar leans closer to Silus.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         I want to share the feeling with
         you. To feel their blood flow
         until every last drop is yours,
         until that weak, pointless little
         pump finally stops.

They are staring at each other very intently now. Edgar
smiles gently.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         The one I had, the police woman.
         She was so strong. I found it hard
         to leave her.

Edgar moves.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         Is she dead?

                   SILUS
         She survived.

                   EDGAR
         Good. I will have her again.

For perhaps the first time, we see a real hint of anger on
Silus' face.

                   SILUS
         You won't touch her.
                                                                  54




  Edgar looks at his brother for a moment. Edgar's features are
  a paradox; almost sympathy for Silus followed by
  understanding. Then he smiles.

                       EDGAR
             You've chosen to watch over her.
             You want her don't you? I can see
             it in your eyes. You are like me.

  Silus' control has returned now.

                       SILUS
             I will pray for your cure, Brother.

  Silus then turns and leaves.

                       EDGAR
             I wont be able to forgive you for
             this you know? Not ever. In fact,
             when I get out of here...

  He moves violently, blood seeping from his wounds now.

                       EDGAR
                    (continuing)
             I will make you see. I will show
             you the way. I will see you drink
             your little police woman right
             through.

  By now frightening music has hummed into existence. Silus has
  paused at the door to the cell. Without looking back he
  passes through the door, leaving Edgar to his prison.

  Edgar, slowly turns back to the window in front of him. He
  sees himself reflected in it. The Camera moves into Edgar's
  eyes. The lights go out. All we are left with are his strange
  reflective eyes. Waiting. Waiting.

                                           FADE OUT:

60 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL - NIGHT                      60

   A smooth, white walled cell. Flash edits of Edgar. Standing,
   posing, balancing literally on his fingertips, doing
   sensuous, slow gymnastic yoga. His hair has changed so we
   know time has passed. Finally he stands there; poised tensile
   steel. He slowly draws his finger nails against the shining
   floor of the cell, it almost looks like he's sharpening them.
   A tube comes from his arm for taking blood samples.

   Then Edgar begins to run directly at the glass window of the
   console room and then dives for it, smashing his head against
   it; blood and saliva left smeared there. Behind the glass
   window the console operators jump.

60B INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL - CONTINUING                60B

   We see Edgar, slowly pulling himself up, blood and bruising
   apparent on his face. He smiles.

   We zoom in close to the glass, see Edgar's infected blood run
   down it until it congeals a little, caught in a tiny, almost
   imperceptible, hairline fracture.


61 EXT: JAMESTOWN CLUBLAND, STREET - NIGHT                      61

   Rain on the streets. A man, covered in tattoos - an affluent
   hood, is in a doorway snorting snuff

   Dominic, Jones and several other cops emerge from hiding
   places, pointing their guns at the man who puts his hands up.
   Hand held cameras follow several other cops and Lilly as they
   move into the building, again catching various hoods unaware.

   Lilly moves forward quickly, down a hallway and finds what
   she is looking for. In a room she discovers a harem of
   prostitutes, none of them older than ten years old. She
   stares at their doll-like faces, then lowers her gun.
                                                                    56



  We see Lilly, the scars from Edgar's attack now healed but
  still apparent on her neck. Her hair is shorter; she seems
  more worn down.

  Jones appears on her shoulder.

                       LILLY
             Take them away from here.

  Jones nods as Lilly walks off.

                       JONES
             You don't feel like a drink?

  But Lilly doesn't respond, she just walks off. Jones watches
  her leave. Then he stares at the round faces of the children
  in front of him, something approaching compassion there.

                       JONES
                    (continuing)
             Now my girls, anyone hungry?


62 EXT: JAMESTOWN CLUBLAND, STREET - CONTINUING                62

  Lilly exits the building into the rain, wrapping herself up
  against it. Then she stops, feels she's being watched. She
  looks up at the surrounding buildings. But there's nothing
  there. She pulls out an amulet with the symbol of the
  Brotherhood on it from under her jacket, and then after a
  beat, kisses it, a little smile comes to warms her lips
  against the cold. She leaves.

   Edgar's cell   is very dimly lit. Edgar is in front of the
   glass window   to the console room. He is repeatedly banging is
   head against   it. And his fingernails slide across the shiny

   it drums eerily.

65 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                 65

   We track through Lilly's apartment, silently. We enter the
   lounge to see Lilly sitting on a couch watching a strange
   looking valve powered globular Television-like device. We
   track ominously up behind her. Then stop.
                                                                58




                   JONES
                (off)
         I knocked.

Lilly turns to Jones.

                   LILLY
         You nearly gave me a heart attack.

Steph now emerges from the kitchen, dressed in a t-shirt and
shorts and carrying some food. Jones looks at her coldly.

                   JONES
         What's this then?

Lilly and Steph smile at the inference Jones is beginning to
draw.

                   STEPH
         My apartment was condemned, keep
         your hair on, what's left of it.

Meanwhile Lilly shushes them and turns back to the murky gray
images emitting from the television.

                   TV PRESENTER
         ...the ascension through the ranks
         of the Church has been fast for
         Brother Silus. He will now be the
         highest ranking cardinal outside
         the ruling council of the
         Brotherhood. This is largely seen
         as a reward for his handling of
         the last influenza pandemic.

Jones and Lilly watch as Silus is seen on the television in
an interview. Steph stares at the screen with awe, she
involuntarily kisses the symbol that hangs from a chain
around her neck; it resembles a Brother's ring.

                   STEPH
         Isn't he amazing?

Jones sneers under his breath.

                    JONES
         A saint.

                    LILLY
         Quiet.

We move over their shoulders to track closer to the black and
white TV screen.
                                                                59




                   TV PRESENTER
         You have been an opponent of those
         who want an easing in the ban on
         genetic research.

                     SILUS
         Yes.

                   TV PRESENTER
         They would say you're denying
         legitimate research into a science
         that would change the world.

                   SILUS
         The church does not deny the
         potential. Only the motivations of
         those who want to exploit it. And
         the fact that we understand so
         little of its power.

                   TV PRESENTER
         With the elimination of influenza,
         are we approaching a new era where
         disease might be a thing of the
         past?

As she is saying this we are now close on the TV's speaker.
We then begin tracking out. We reveal the speaker is not part
of the TV, but the speaker in Edgar's cell. Edgar, smiling
coldly as he listens. As he listens he is gently gliding his
finger nails against a sharp edge of the chair; sharpening
them.

                   SILUS
         Disease is part of nature, it will
         always be a part of our lives.

Close on Edgar.

                     EDGAR
         How true.

                   TV PRESENTER
                (off)
         Brother Silus' confirmation
         ceremony will be held today in the
         sacred Chapel of St. Augustine
         where all the Brotherhood will
         gather.

Edgar listens, smiles.
                                                                        60


 66 INT: CEREMONIAL CHAPEL - DAY                                 66

    An ornate door; ancient, with strange, beautiful dark symbols
    carved into the old wood, like something out of a castle in
    Prague. The doors open and we see a large chapel. And within
    the large dark interior, lit by great long candles, the
    Brotherhood have gathered. They all stare at the camera,
    which we reveal is Silus' POV.

    We see SILUS. Unchanged, still the perfect creature he has
    always been. But for now the suit has gone and instead he
    stands draped in fine ropes, robes that carry his life on
    them; achievements, his rank, which is now high.

    In the distance, at an alter, stands AUGUSTUS. He is also in
    his gowns. A gong sounds and the Brothers, in unison with the
    music, begin to chant; it is eerie, it sounds like Tibetan
    monks.

 70 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, SECURITY CONTROL ROOM -           70
    CONTINUING

    Professor Liepsky, looking more aged, worn, enters the
    control room. Alarms are sounding. At the console is a human
    male who looks terrified.

                         CONSOLE OPERATOR
               I turned off the lights to try and
               calm him...

    Liepsky hits a button and it floods Edgar's cell with light.

    Edgar is right there, staring at them, his hands plastered
    over the glass window. He is covered in blood. In the
    background a bloody corpse on the floor. Edgar bangs his head
    against the glass, making Liepsky flinch. On Edgar's forehead
    we see scars from this kind of repeated banging.

                         CONSOLE OPERATOR
                      (continuing)
               We gassed him as usual. We waited
               10 minutes. He must have held his
               breath.

    The look on Liepsky's face says it all. We see Edgar. We had
    thought he was looking at the Professor. But he's not, his
    gaze is focused past the Professor to the dimly seen back
    wall of the control room.

    On it is a schematic, showing this room, other rooms on the
    level, the elevator shaft. Edgar is talking it all in.
                                                                   61




70A INT: CEREMONIAL CHAPEL - DAY                             70A

   Silus, on one knee before Augustus. Augustus now places a
   ceremonial sword at the back of Silus' neck, then draws it
   gently across the skin. Below, a Brother holds out a bowl to
   catch the drops of Silus' blood.

                       AUGUSTUS
             The blood flows, through them, to
             us and we preserve them, preserve
             the blood we are bound to protect.

   Silus raises his head. We see his face. He takes the bowl,
   drinks and then stands, holding it up to the other Brothers.

                       SILUS
             Let the blood be one and the two
             races join, as the Perfect
             Creature.

71 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, CELL - DAY                       71

   Close on Edgar, smiling. Calm.

                       EDGAR
             Today my brother enters the
             history books, Professor.

                       PROFESSOR LIEPSKY
                    (over the tannoy)
             Move back!

   After a moment, Edgar slowly walks backward in perfectly
   smooth movements.

                       EDGAR
             Tonight all the Brothers will be
             with him. A perfect day for me to
             celebrate.

   From the far wall Edgar begins to glide forward, first in
   slow motion then ramping up to full speed, launching himself
   at the glass window. He bounces off it, leaving blood and
   saliva there.

   The Professor and the console operator share an unsettled
   glance.

   Edgar slowly stands. He stares very intently at the glass
   window in front of him. We zoom in on the glass. The small
   hair line fracture we saw previously now begins to lengthen
   before our eyes.

   Edgar's face. A smile. Then he is forward at high velocity
   before anything else can happen, smashing once more into the
   glass window, this time shattering it into a thousand tiny
   pieces.


71A INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUI71A

   Horrified the console operator begins to make an escape. But
   Edgar is on him before they're a few paces towards the door.
   Edgar's long fingers sink into his neck like the flesh and
   bone were clay. He screams.

   The Professor makes it to the door, pulls himself through and
   shuts it, but on Edgar's hand. Edgar doesn't flinch, but
   kicks the door open.


72 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, HALL - DAY                       72

   The Professor is now scrambling, half falling in slow motion
   as Edgar advances. As normal motion returns he kicks Liepsky
   in the head; the sound of impact has a nasty fatality to it.
                                                                     63



   Cut to

   Edgar. A door further down the hall is being unbolted. Edgar
   immediately runs towards it, then launches himself at it, his
   fingers extended like knives which enter the eyes of a guard
   who's coming through the doorway. The guard falls back on
   another two guards behind him.

   A round from a shotgun goes off, taking a small chunk from
   Edgar's side, but it's nothing more than a bee sting to him.
   His speed and precision is that of a creature who knows he
   only has one chance. He kicks the second guard under the
   chin, instantly snapping his neck, while flicking the third
   in the eyes with his sharpened fingernails. This guard falls,
   his eyes leaking orbs.

   Beat.

   Edgar crouches like a dark god of destruction, a siren
   sounding, the lights all going off, then flicking to red
   emergency lights. Edgar's eyes reflect in the half-light.
   Then he bares his teeth. At the end of the hallway he can
   hear the elevator arriving on this floor. Edgar smiles.

   The gleaming surfaces of the ground floor of the Brotherhood
   building. We hear the elevator begin to arrive. We pan off
   this to a desk where a receptionist sits.

   Cut to

   The Receptionist; she's trying desperately to place a call.
   We see the shadow from a figure cast over her and she turns
   and looks up, fear making her shake now.

   Cut to

   Edgar, staring down at her.

                        EDGAR

76 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, HALL - LATER                    76

  Slow steadicam along the underground halls. We see the bodies
  of Edgar's victims being cleaned up by personnel. We stop. In
  the distance we see the door to Edgar's cell open.

  Cut to Silus, observing the scene. The lighting is
  intermittent, flickering. Augustus is standing next to Silus,
  the weird light of the hallway reflecting in his eyes.

                      AUGUSTUS
            Now he carries this thing out into
            the world. Can you imagine what
            will happen if he infects others?
            Or if the experiments were known.

  We are left with Silus' beautiful, reflective eyes.

                      SILUS
            The question becomes what will he
            do next? He said he would kill us
            all. But especially the police
            officer. Lilly.

77 INT: JAMESTOWN SUBWAY - SUNSET                             77

  Flashing lights of subway trains screaming through subway
  tunnels, wheels screeching as metal grinds on metal.


78 INT: JAMESTOWN SUBWAY EXIT - CONTINUING                    78

  The streets are flooding like Bangkok in the monsoon; rain
  pouring off awnings that hang out over the street. The
  streets are full; prostitutes, drug peddlers, apothecary
  shops, the industrial revolution low down and dirty. There is
  a fight breaking out between two men who are dressed like
  punk rockers.

  Several people are alighting from a subway exit; the exit has
  "Jamestown/Brougham" on a nouveaux styled sign that might
  remind you of a Paris or Barcelona metro, only dirtier.

  We see Lilly in the distance, in her dark jacket, emerge from
  the subway. She begins the short walk to her apartment. The
  streets are crowded and there are plenty of Maori people in
  this area, so there's plenty of food stalls; the air is
  filled with the sound of evening prayers. Lilly stops at one
  of the food stalls and starts picking up vegetables. A Maori
  man comes out and smiles and they start talking in the local
  dialect. She buys a live eel.

  Across the street, in a doorway, we see a very weedy, sick
  looking guy - this is Freddy. Standing next to him is a
  Prostitute, swaying from the effects of laudanum.

                      PROSTITUTE
            Come on governor, you going to pay
            me or not?

                      FREDDY
            Soon enough my cherub. I've not
            finished with you yet.

  He sucks on something that looks like a ventaline inhaler,
  then pockets it, licks his lips and begins heading off down
  the street, the drunk Prostitute dragged along.

  Cut to

  Again, Lilly from a distance, walking along the street which
  is more deserted, now carrying a bag full of groceries. As
  she walks we begin to hear voices; violent, arguing. Lilly
  approaches an alleyway, the raised voices becoming louder.
  She slowly places her bag on the ground and then pulls out a
  revolver. She edges into the alleyway.


79 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - CONTINUING                  79

  Lilly's POV down the alleyway. It seems empty. The POV moves
  in a little and there in an offshoot of the alleyway we can
  see Freddy. He is standing over a woman who cowers; she's

  plainly a prostitute. Freddy points a gun at her head.

                      FREDDY
            You've been ripping me off! I
            should blow your dirty little
            brains out!

                      STEPH
                   (off)
            Police! Put the gun down now!

  And now we see, it's not Lilly we've been watching, but
  Steph. She points her gun at Freddy. Freddy turns to Steph.
  He slowly raises his arms.

                      FREDDY
            It's ok. I'm complying officer,
            see.

                      STEPH
            Put the gun on the ground and step
            away!
                                                                66




                   FREDDY
         I'm doing it.

Freddy puts the gun down. The Prostitute on the ground now
scrambles to her feet and heads towards Steph.

                   PROSTITUTE
         He's crazy! Fucking crazy!

She gives Freddy the finger then heads off.

                    STEPH
                 (to the prostitute)
         Wait!
                (to Freddy)
         Down! Right now, down on the
         ground!

Freddy gets down.

                   FREDDY
         I'm getting wet now.

Low Angle on Steph approaching. Behind her a FIGURE is
descending the wall behind him.

                    STEPH
         Shut up!

Steph is over Freddy now. He's staring up at her. He can see
that a shape has appeared behind Steph. EDGAR, his eyes
gleaming. Steph pulls out some handcuffs.

                   STEPH
                (continuing)
         Put your hands behind your back.

                   FREDDY
         Sure. Anything you say.

But before Steph can move forward, Edgar has her gun hand in
a vice-like grip. She cries out in pain as her wrist
disintegrates. As a reflex she stamps on Edgar's foot and
kicks him in the groin with her other.

He does not flinch. He smashes Steph into a down pipe on the
wall of the alley so that wet grit is ground into her face.
We then see Edgar's face at her shoulder.

                   EDGAR
         Nice to meet you again.

Edgar pulls back the jacket at Steph's neck to find no scars.
He pulls Steph's face towards him brutally, staring at her
profile.
                                                                67




He then smashes her head against the pipe so that she falls
unconscious to the ground.

                   FREDDY
         What's wrong?

                   EDGAR
         You brought me the wrong one.

                   FREDDY
         Does it matter, one's as good as
         the next?

Edgar's stare makes Freddy shut up and avert his eyes. Edgar
then turns on the tube on his arm so that blood drips into
the unconscious Steph's mouth; making her gag.

                   FREDDY
                (continuing)
         You promised me some of that.

Freddy's licking his lips.

Edgar studies Freddy, then raises his arm. Freddy just
stares. We see the tube on Edgar's arm that connects to his
veins. And in a moment Freddy has latched onto it and is
sucking like some kind of human leech.

                   EDGAR
         What do you see Freddy. Visions?
         Can you see your future?

For a moment Edgar strokes Freddy's hair, then rips the tube
away.

                   FREDDY
         Hey!

Freddy moves forward, but is pushed back by Edgar.

                   EDGAR
         Don't be a greedy little pig
         Freddy. You have to earn more.

Close on Edgar, his repellent features under the hood. He
looks up. Far above, through the falling rain, past the high-
rise slum around them; we see the moon hanging like a pearly
crescent in the sky. The moon is slowly obscured by clouds.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         We have more to do.

Cut to
                                                                    68




80 EXT: JAMESTOWN CLUBLAND, STREET - NIGHT                     80

  We see a figure exiting the subway. This time it is Lilly,
  following the same path that Steph took.
                                                                 69




Making her way through the crowded street. The rain has given
way to a fine mist.

Then, as Lilly moves forward she senses something; that
feeling again, that she is being watched. She stands for a
moment as people push past, looks up at the gothic Victorian
buildings that loom out of the drifting mist. But there is
nothing.

Lilly begins to make her way through the drifting mist,
casting glances at the odd passerby.

Then, ahead of her, there is one pedestrian in particular,
taller than the rest, wearing a great hooded jacket, who
stands out. He is immediately suspicious to Lilly. He is
slowly moving through the crowd towards her. From under the
hooded jacket we see the glint of the approaching figure's
eyes; an intense stare hidden in the shadows. The man now
puts his hand in his pocket as if he's reaching for something.

Lilly now slowly slips her hand into her jacket, her gun a
cold hard presence in her hand. She stares ahead at the
approaching figure, who has now stopped, after bumping into
a pedestrian. Lilly continues forward, closer, closer. From
under the hooded jacket the glistening eyes of the man ahead
catches hers for a moment. The man now begins to approach
her, his hand pulling something from his jacket, going for
something. A gun.

Lilly immediately pulls her gun. The mist beads on the
shining barrel of her gun. The man is raising his hand
towards her.

                   LILLY
         Police. Put your hands where I can
         see them!

The man now lurches forward, his hand rising towards Lilly,
her finger begins to caress the trigger of her gun, as the
man looms closer. And then he is gone.

Cut to

The man slamming against the wet wall of a building, grasping
at the hands that now threaten to throttle him.

And we see Silus, his hands on the man's throat, and for only
the second time, we see anger in Silus' eyes.

People in the street scatter as more Brothers emerge with
guns pointed. And Lilly, shaking, pointing her gun at the man
Silus is holding. On the ground, next to the man, she sees
what he had in his hand. A pamphlet. Asking people to come to
church service; a picture of a Brother priest serenely
beaming out from it.
                                                                 70




Meanwhile the man that Silus has is gagging on the ground,
Silus' hand still on his throat. He's begging.

                    PARISHONER
          Holy brother, please...

Lilly grabs Silus' shoulder.

                    LILLY
          Let him go.

She shows Silus the pamphlet.

                    LILLY
                 (continuing)
          He's harmless. Let him go.

The man now pulls back his hood. He is black, his large,
watery eyes stare up in awe at Silus. He grabs Silus' hand
which now relaxes and draws Silus' ring to his lips, kissing
it, in tears.

                    PARISHONER
          Forgive me. I've offended you...

We see Silus' dark stare.

A beat.

Then Silus reaches out and places his hand on the man's head.

                    SILUS
          No. You are divine. It is the
          world that offends me.

Silus rises, the Parishioner just lays there in awe. Silus now
turns to Lilly who is on his shoulder. And now Lilly realizes
for the first time that it is Silus.

                    LILLY
          Brother Silus. What's going on?

We then hear a police siren and a car pulls up through the
rain. The door opens and Jones emerges, taking in both Lilly
and Silus. A grim smile of realization comes to Jones' face.
He pulls something from his jacket.

Cut to
                                                                   71




81 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, LOUNGE - NIGHT                     81

  Steph's ID is tossed down on a table.

                      JONES
                   (off)
            A shopkeeper heard yelling. Went
            to see, found this. One witness.
            A prostitute.

  Jones tosses down a photo. It is Freddy, looking suitably
  scummy in a police identikit photo.

                      JONES
                   (continuing)
            She identified this lovely
            citizen. We thought maybe he had
            a grudge or was crazy. I guess we
            were wrong.

  Silus stands by the window; lights make patterns on his face.

                      SILUS
            It is Edgar.

                      LILLY
            And now he's got Steph. Why does
            he want her?

                      SILUS
            She is not what he was after.

  We see Lilly slowly getting it.

                      LILLY
            Steph was staying with me. She was
            wearing my coat. It was me he was
            after. Wasn't it?

  Silus now turns, slowly moves towards her,   coming out of the
  shadows. Lilly finds it hard to return his   gaze,
  involuntarily touches her neck where it is   scarred from
  Edgar's attack. Jones is watching all this   very carefully.

                      SILUS
            Yes. He will come for you Lilly.

                      JONES
            Right, then we put you somewhere
            safe and set up this place.
            Shooters on the roofs. And when he
            comes we blow his fucking brains
            out.

                      SILUS
            He will know. He will see and hear
            it.
                                                                  72




  Lilly is staring at Steph's ID.

                      LILLY
            It has to be me. That's what he
            wants. It's the only chance
            Steph's got.

                      JONES
            What are you talking about, she's
            probably dead already...

                      LILLY
            Jones! And we can't make it too
            hard. He has to be able to get in.
            He can't suspect anything.

  Jones is shaking his head. Silus just stares at Lilly.

                      LILLY
                   (continuing)
            That's the way it will be. I'm the
            bait.

  Close on Silus.


82 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - SUNSET                    82

  We are in a large, derelict warehouse; detritus and stacked
  and smashed wooden crates. Music is playing somewhere in the
  distance from a phonograph. We track through the space.
  Daylight comes through cracks in the blacked out windows high
  above, creating tiny shafts of laser light that flicker from
  the dust.

  We pass through the stacks of crates that are like a high
  walled maze. Music emits from a stereo, loud. We continue to
  move down a hall. Through the detritus, towards a door. A
  hand opens the door.


83 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          83

  In the corner of the room, huddled, chained to the floor, is
  Steph. She does not look good. In fact she looks very sick.
  There are tubes coming off her arm.

  Freddy stoops down and begins to check the tubes running from
  her arm. There are small taps on the tubes. He turns them on.
  Blood begins to flow from her into a cup that is already
  stained red. As he turns it off Steph shivers, her eyes open.
  The whites of her eyes are blood red; she is sick. She
  speaks, weakly.
                                                                  73




                      STEPH
            Help me. Please, I'm sick. Help me.

  She reaches for Freddy, but he pulls away. Freddy's not
  looking too hot either.

                      FREDDY
            Don't fucking touch me.

  He picks up the half filled cup and leaves. Steph stares
  after him. Tears welling in her eyes, beginning to shake now,
  moving against the chains that bind her. But they stay fast.


84 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - CONTINUING                84

  Freddy moves into the large warehouse space, the music still
  echoing. Freddy looks around, searching for Edgar.

                       FREDDY
            Hey!

  His voice echoes through the empty space.

                      FREDDY
                   (continuing)
            Where've you gone now?


85 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                           85

  A POV, wavering slightly, the hint of a whispering breath. We
  see Lilly's apartment. The shot zooms in at high velocity,
  searching the windows, zooming in here to check the lock on
  this window, then on that. Then the shot wildly pans and
  twists to the street below. Again it zooms in, to the
  entrance of the building, to a couple walking past in the
  night, as if searching for any sign of something out of the
  ordinary. We can hear the couples voices, talking about inane
  things.

  Cut to Edgar's face in the shadows. His eyes reflective, his
  whole being readied and concentrating. He closes his eyes. We
  move around to end close on his ear, the soundtrack becoming
  stark as the sounds of the night become eerily separated and
  distinct. One sound in particular, a kind of metal sound,
  scratching slightly, growing louder.

  Edgar's eyes open.

  Cut to

  A zoom speeding towards Lilly's bedroom window, then swooping
  at the last minute to end on an apartment one floor down.
                                                                    74




  And there, gently moving in the night air, a partially open
  window, the latch grinding in the breeze.

  Cut to


86 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUING                         86

  A whiz pan POV, ending on the lounge of Lilly's apartment;
  as if we just caught the last part of someone turning their
  head, as if alerted. All the lights are out. We slowly begin
  to move forward, dipping and gliding silently, into the
  hallway. Slowly we approach a doorway and creep into...


87 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUING                87

  We can see Lilly lying on the bed, her skin alabaster in the
  moonlight that comes through the window blinds. Closer closer
  until we halt above her.

  Cut closer to see Lilly asleep; her hand grips her service
  revolver which protrudes from under her pillow.

  We see Silus standing above her, his eyes glisten in the
  sub light. As he watches, Lilly moves, as if she's having a
  dream, her hand grips the gun beneath her pillow.

  Silus slowly bends down, close to her. Watching. Then he
  reaches out, as if to gently wake her, then stops as Lilly
  stirs. She turns, curling up into the fetal position. Silus
  is confronted with the old scars from Edgar's attack.

  For a moment Silus stares at her. Stares. Then very quietly,
  smoothly, he moves his head down, very close to her arm. He
  sniffs it, as you would something very delicate, very
  complex. Then he closes his eyes.

  We see Lilly, her arm. Silus slowly enters frame, moves his
  face close to Lilly, moves along her arm as if taking in her
  scent. Slowly her arm raises, as his face moves up her body
  to her neck, her hand now embracing Silus' head. Closer as
  his face is near hers and still with eyes closed her face
  turns towards him, his dark lips and hers are close.

  Cut to

  Silus, back where he was, smelling her arm. His eyes open and
  he moves back a little, as if shocked by the daydream he has
  just indulged in.

  We see Lilly, as she was before, curled up in the fetal
  position. Then a sound.
                                                                    75




  Silus immediately pivots, his gun immediately pointed at the
  figure who stands silhouetted in the doorway. Jones.

                      JONES
            What are you doing?

  The camera immediately drops, through the floor of Lilly's
  apartment to the apartment below to find...


88 INT: APARTMENT BELOW LILLY'S - CONTINUING                   88

  ...Edgar, standing in the apartment below, immediately
  freezing. We zoom into his ear as he listens.

  Flash cuts of sound and image; a large man turning in his bed
  and groaning, a tap drips in an apartment, a fluorescent
  colored mosquito catcher vaporizing a mosquito with a zing,
  then a woman's lips; whispering...

                      LILLY
            What is it? Jones?

  Cut to


89 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - CONTINUING                89

  Silus above Lilly, his hand up to silence her, Jones stock
  still in the doorway. Waiting, waiting...

  Bang, Silus rushes to the window of the apartment, ripping it
  open, pointing his gun below. But there is no one there. Then
  Silus spots it. On the floor below the window is open, a
  curtain gently wafts out of the window in the breeze. Silus
  turns to Jones and Lilly.

                      SILUS
            Stay here.

  Silus immediately drops out of the window.

  Cut to

  Lilly rushes to the window and looks out expecting to see
  Silus dead on the pavement below, but the street is empty.
  And then she sees it; the window below her apartment is open.


90 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - CONTINUING                90

  Lilly, gun extended, moving forward towards her apartment
  door, Jones behind her, trying to grab her.
                                                              76




                   JONES
         Get back here, Lilly!

But Lilly shoves him off, opens the door and moves into the
hall and waits.
                                                                    77



  She hears more smashing from the other side of the building.
  She turns to Jones.

                        LILLY
            Cover me.

  And she's off, smashing the apartment door in front of her
  with her foot and moving into the apartment, towards the
  window beyond. Jones can only curse, lift his gun and move
  after her.


91 INT: APARTMENT ADJACENT TO LILLY'S - CONTINUING             91

  Lilly's POV crashing through the apartment and reaching the
  window, pulling it open to see...


92 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, REAR - CONTINUING                   92

  ...Lilly's POV of the city below. We see her search with her
  eyes, and then she sees it.

  Cut to

  Lilly's POV, closer, looking down on Edgar running over a
  roof.

  Cut to

  Edgar running towards us as we track back, then he launches
  himself...

  Cut to

  Low angle, Edgar jumping from above us, to land almost on the
  camera, stopping himself by grabbing iron piping protruding
  from the side of the building.

  Edgar turns, smiles, thinking he's escaped; then shock comes
  across his face.

  Cut to

  Edgar's POV as Silus flies through the air and crashes
  straight into the camera. Silus' hands go straight for
  Edgar's throat, stopping Edgar from falling. The two
  Brothers eyes lock.

                      EDGAR
            You saved me...

  Then Edgar's smile. He pushes off the wall with his legs,
  sending both of them tumbling over the railing.
                                                                78




We see them fall, Silus hitting a railing which sends him
spinning out of control, whilst Edgar manages to clasp onto
it.

Cut to

Silus' POV, tumbling wildly out of control, heading for the
ground, finally coming to a jarring stop, the view of the
alleyway upside down.

We now reveal Silus, only just conscious, caught in wire
netting, hanging upside down in the alleyway.

And there, landing, is Edgar, poised, watching. Edgar slowly
approaches so that he is near. He bends down to Silus.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         When will you admit it. You're
         just like me.

Edgar's nose is bleeding. He dabs some on his fingers, then
raises his hand to Silus.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         Maybe you need some encouragement.

He brings the dripping blood closer to Silus, closer...

Then an explosion; the sound of bullets whistling through the
air. Then Edgar is gone.

Cut to

Lilly and Jones entering the alleyway to find Silus still
hanging from the railing.

                   LILLY
                (to Jones)
         Get him down.

Lilly then moves into the adjacent alleyway to search for
Edgar.

                   JONES
         Lilly, wait! Damn you. Lilly!

She turns and gives him a final quick look.

                   LILLY
         If he escapes then Steph is dead.
         Just follow me when you can, hurry!

Cut to
                                                                79




Lilly moving through a slick wet alleyway; water plops and
dribbles from leaking pipes. She swings her gun towards
movement; water crashing out of a pipe. Lilly's shaking,
terrified, but she keeps on going. And then another sound and
she swings her gun to find Edgar, standing in the shadows,
waiting.

                   EDGAR
         The little policewoman.

                   LILLY
         Don't move!

Edgar purposely raises his hand so that she fires; the bullet
going through the flesh of Edgar's arm; his arm now smoking.

                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         I said don't move. Where is she,
         where's the girl?

Edgar can only smile.

                   EDGAR
         Oh, I've killed her already.
         Essentially.

Then he moves, she fires, but he's too fast, spinning,
diving, in an instant he has the gun, twisting it and Lilly's
arm behind her back. She fires, once, twice, the bullets and
smoke rising up from Edgar's side. He twists harder, the gun
then falling to the ground. Edgar is now behind her. He moves
his face close to hers.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         Has he tasted you yet, little
         policewoman?

Lilly tries to twist out of his grasp.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         He's just the same as me, you know
         it, you can feel it too.

                   LILLY
         He's nothing like you.

Edgar's face twists into a smile.

                   EDGAR
         We will see. You will be my tool.

                                         JUMP CUT:
                                                                  80




  A cat, hissing, screeching.

  Cut to Silus and Jones entering the alleyway, the cat tearing
  away from them in fright. Jones moves forward and we tilt
  down to see Lilly's gun lying on the wet cobblestones, smoke
  wisping from the barrel. Jones stoops down and picks up the
  gun, then turns to Silus. After a beat, Jones throws the gun
  at Silus' head. Silus dodges it easily and it clacks onto the
  cobblestones.

                      JONES
            You happy now?

  Cut to


93 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, TOILET - DAY               93

  Close on Freddy's face, looking at himself in a mirror. He's
  pulling back his eyelid; his eyes are bloodshot and he's
  sweating. Freddy then pushes the mirror shut and we see
  Edgar, silhouetted in the bathroom doorway.

                      FREDDY
            You scared the shit out of me.
            Hey, the police woman. She's real
            sick. To tell the truth I don't
            feel so hot myself.

  Edgar approaches, still silhouetted.

                      EDGAR
            I want you to take her and put her
            where they'll find her.

                      FREDDY
            But I'm sick. She's given me
            something...

  Edgar moves incredibly fast, we can't quite see what he has
  done but we suspect he has just buried his hand in Freddy's
  chest. We see Freddy's face, stunned, deathly white.

                      EDGAR
            What have I said to you?

  Freddy falls, leaving Edgar's hand in mid air; we can't see
  clearly, but it likes frighteningly like he has one of
  Freddy's internal organs in his hand.

                      EDGAR
                   (continuing)
            I hate arguments.

  Cut to
                                                                    81



94 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, ALLEYWAY - DAY                         94

  Close on a pendant; the symbol of the Brothers.

  We pull out to reveal Steph, very sick now. Edgar is has her
  wrapped in a sheet and is half carrying her along a decrepit
  alley. Ahead of him is a street; we can see several passersby.

  Edgar sits Steph up against the wall of the alley, propped
  up. She really is sick. She coughs.

  Edgar looks at her for a moment. Then after consideration,
  takes her hands and crosses them, and places an envelope in
  her limp hands. Happy with the composition he moves off.

  Cut to

  A close High Angle on Steph looking up, her bloodshot, dazed
  eyes staring blankly. We drift up and away from her. Already
  the rats are beginning to come out and sniff her.


95 INT: HOSPITAL, HALLWAY - DAY                                95

  There are several nurses running towards us, they turn and
  move down a hallway. We reveal Jones and Dominic. They move
  to the nurses station and Jones flashes his ID.

                      JONES
            Stephanie Richards, you just
            brought her in.

  And then a scream. Blood curdling; the sound of someone
  insane, screaming their lungs out, hurling abuse. We see the
  faces of the cops and the terrified nurse in front of them
  who points down the hall where the noise is coming from. The
  Cops move off. The nurse then sees someone else arrive. She
  raises the pendant that hangs around her neck and kisses it.

                      NURSE
            Thank god you're here.

  We see who has entered. It is Silus. Near him there are
  several people sick. They look sick; like Steph and Freddy
  looked.

  Cut to


96 INT: HOSPITAL, ISOLATION WARD - CONTINUING                  96

  Jones and the Dominic move through an anteroom. Nursing staff
  and doctors are madly running about. The screaming we heard
  before punctuates the noisy clutter of medical procedures.

  Jones approaches a door; it has the words "level 4 isolation
  unit" on it. A large Guard blocks his way.
                                                                   82



  Jones shows his ID. A figure brushes past them and enters the
  door; the figure is fully decked out in something like a
  spacesuit.

  Jones and Dominic are ushered sideways, to another room. This
  room has a glass viewing window which looks into the adjacent
  room. A middle aged Doctor stands there, his thumb nail in
  his mouth, looking thoughtful. When he turns towards Jones,
  we can see there is fear in his eyes. Jones shows his ID.
  Screaming from within the adjacent room draws his attention
  and that of Jones.


97 INT: HOSPITAL, STEPH'S ROOM - CONTINUING                   97

  In the adjacent room two nurses are trying to put in a line
  to Steph's arms which are restrained by straps. Steph lies on
  a bed. She looks truly sick; her hair matted, her skin
  blotchy. Her eyes are also blood red, the tiny blood vessels
  hemorrhaging. And she is screaming abuse at the nurses and
  Doctors who work on her.

  Close of Jones, staring at the scene.

  Silus now enters the room. Almost immediately Steph stops
  screaming. She is staring directly at Silus; even this
  deranged, she is still in complete awe.

                      JONES
            Will she recover?

  The Doctor turns to Jones; the Doctor looks puzzled.

                      DOCTOR
            No. Containment is the issue now.
            She is... insane. And we've had
            more cases, 10 in the last hour.

  The Doctor leaves.

  Jones turns to Silus.

                      JONES
            What is this? What is it?

                      SILUS
            It comes from Edgar. He has shared
            his blood with them.

                      JONES
            You're telling me that he's out
            there spreading this around?

  Jones gets close to Silus, intimidating.
                                                                        83




                         JONES
                      (continuing)
               He'll give it to Lilly!

    Dominic gets in between.

                         DOMINIC
               Jones! Back off.

    Dominic pushes Jones back and then stares at Silus.

                         DOMINIC
                      (continuing)
               This is spreading.

    Silus doesn't speak, just stares at Steph.

                         DOMINIC
                      (continuing)
               Brother Silus?

                         JONES
               That's it, Lilly's dead.

                         SILUS
               No. He will keep her alive.

                        DOMINIC
               Why?

                         SILUS
               So that I will come for him.
               That's what he wants.

    Dominic pulls an envelope from his jacket and passes it to
    Silus, who opens it to discover a beautifully handwritten
    letter.

                         DOMINIC
               It says, "Everything flows from
               me. My blood will change the
               world." What does that mean?

    Silus stares at the two men. Then turns to Steph, her eyes,
    creepy, still locked on Silus.

103A EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM BUILDING, ROOF - NIGHT                  103A

    Jamestown, from above. We drift down so that we see the
    buildings, see fires breaking out, hear screams echoing
    through the night. We continue down towards the rooftop of
    one building in particular. We see one of the infected
    citizens of Jamestown standing on the roof, screaming out
    into the night like some crazed animal.

    We continue past the creature, then travel through a
    ventilation shaft on the roof. We hurtle down this, down,
    down to the depths of the building and out the shaft into a
    subterranean basement. We drift through a doorway in the wet
    stone wall, down a tunnel, to finally enter a room.

    And we see Lilly. She is covered in grime, her hands bound
    above her head with chains to an ancient, ornate pipes that
    twist through the place. She looks up at us.

    Cut to


103B INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING             103B

    Edgar, now standing above Lilly. He bends down, checking the
    chains that bind her. His face moves close to her so that he
    can smell her. Hear her heart pounding. See the scars from
    his previous attack. Then a noise, echoing through the
    tunnels. The sound of the mad infected denizens of the
    containment zone, screaming out into the night. Edgar smiles.

                        EDGAR
              It almost sounds like children
              playing, don't you think?

                        LILLY
              No.

                        EDGAR
              I looked at your body. You have
              borne a child.

    Lilly's features tense.

                        EDGAR
                     (continuing)
              Did you abandon it? Your kind are
              good at that.

    Even though her position is impossible, Lilly won't show
    Edgar fear.

                        LILLY
              Why don't you just kill me?

    Edgar just smiles. Lilly spits in his face and screams at him.
                                                               85



                   LILLY
                (continuing)
         Kill me!

Edgar grabs her by the throat, for a moment anger boils out
of Edgar, but he restrains himself.

                   EDGAR
         I can see why he likes you. But I
         have a better use for you. To save
         you, Silus will take my blood.
         Join me.

                   LILLY
         You're insane.

                   EDGAR
         The world is insane. I am better
         than you. But they force me to
         serve you. Does that happen in a
         sane world? Forced to watch you
         waste the most precious thing you
         have. Life.

Then Edgar's face changes; he stares at her with pity, for a
moment we see a hint of the noble creature he used to be.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         Do you know what they do to us
         when we are born? They take us
         from our mothers. Force us into a
         life of loneliness, and denial.
         Can you imagine a life like that?

Lilly senses an opening.

                   LILLY
         You don't have to do this. You can
         change things.

Edgar places his head in his hands, he seems to be weeping.

                   EDGAR
         You have reminded me of something.

When he looks back up at her, he is terrifying to behold.

                   EDGAR
                (continuing)
         I must search out my mother, if
         she still lives. And kill her for
         what she did.
                                                                      86




   Edgar smiles quietly, rises and exits.

   We are left with Lilly bound to the rusty pipes. She strains,
   tries to pull her hands from the chains, but they won't move.
   Above her on the pipe there is a old rusty bracket. Lilly
   blinks through the sweat running into her eyes. She moves the

   chains that bind her hands closer to the bracket and begins
   rubbing the chains against the bracket in the vain hope that
   she may be able to cut her way through the chains. She
   strains harder and harder, fighting back the tears, the fear,
   she just grinds at the chain repetitively.

   Cut to


104 INT: HOSPITAL, STEPH'S ROOM - DAY                           104

   Steph, in the hospital bed, her eyes staring up, hollow. A
   bed sheet is drawn over her dead face.

   Cut to


105 INT: HOSPITAL, VARIOUS - CONTINUING                         105

   We see Silus. Staring through a window into an office. In
   there we can see Jones. Jones is talking in a very animated
   manner to someone who is obviously a reporter. The reporter
   stares, like Jones, through the window towards Silus. Jones
   turns away, looking guilty.

   Cut to

   Bedlam in the hospital corridors. People screaming, being
   restrained. What is clear is that the virus Steph had has now
   broken out into a plague of biblical proportions. We see a
   DOCTOR standing in the middle of the hospital corridor, blood
   over his smock, in a state of pure shock.

   And we see Silus there. A perfect creature observing the
   chaos. As he stands there he can see a small child; a girl,
   maybe around five. Silus stares at the child. The girl is
   holding her mother's hand. Her mother lies on a cot, strapped
   down; there are many other cots filling the crowded hallway.
   Her mother is dead. The girl's dirty face is stained with
   tears. For a moment Silus wavers.

   Then he moves over to the girl. She    stares up at him with her
   tear stained grimy face. Silus goes    to place his hand on her
   forehead as blessing, but the child    cringes, then jumps up
   and escapes down the hallway. Silus    can only stare at the
   horror of it all.

    On a dirty, stained valve radio. We slowly track in on the
    speaker, hearing an interview coming from it.

                         REPORTER
                      (off)
               Some say this plague is the result
               of genetic experimentation, by the
               Brothers. Do you have a comment?

               Jamestown now under quarantine.

    Armed, gas masked guards stand with their guns at the ready.
    Beyond the blockade is Jamestown. Fires burn, bodies lie on
    the streets.

                         REPORTER
                      (off)

               They say the Queen has left the
               city... Is this martial law?

    A figure is stumbling towards us. One of the guards fires and
    the figure drops.

110 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, FOYER - DAY                     110

   There is an angry mob, banging on the locked doors of the
   brotherhood building. Their placards tell the tale. "Brothers
   have brought the plague." "No to Genetic experimentation."

                        EDGAR

              Do you like the world I am making

              little policewoman yet. But I will
              soon. You'll just have to find me.
              You know where I am. Everything
              flows from me. Remember that...

   Human police stand ready with guns. It's a disaster. Silus is
   there. He watches the faces of the mob, baying for blood. He
   sees them burning the emblems of the brotherhood.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


111 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, AUGUSTUS' OFFICE - CONTINUING   111

   We are in a beautifully ornate office. It is like a private
   chapel. We see Silus enter. He is grim. Augustus is kneeling
   in prayer. He senses Silus.

                        AUGUSTUS
              The infection is spreading. Each
              day he shares his blood with more
              of them. Even though they are
              locked in their homes.
                                                                89




                   SILUS
         He is somewhere in the quarantine
         zone. I will find him.

Augustus turns to Silus. Augustus moves closer to him, stares
into Silus' strange, pale eyes.

                   AUGUSTUS
         Clear. So very clear your eyes.
         The way they were when you were
         born. There will be no search.

Augustus moves off to his desk. Silus is shocked.

                   SILUS
         No search?

                   AUGUSTUS
         The Queen has instructed the
         government to evacuate the city
         around the quarantine zone. In
         another day they will take action.

                   SILUS
         What kind of action?

                   AUGUSTUS
         Eradication. Of everything within
         the area. They will burn it all.
         Including Edgar.

                   SILUS
         And the innocents there, who are
         not infected?

                   AUGUSTUS
         It is a necessary step. We cannot
         let this escape.

                   SILUS
         No!

Augustus looks up at Silus; this is perhaps the first time
Silus has refused anything that Augustus has decreed.
                                                                     90




                       AUGUSTUS
             Is it the policewoman? Is this
             affecting your thinking? There is
             no love for our kind Silus. Only
             service.

                       SILUS
             We have done this. Released this
             thing into the world. We have
             betrayed their trust in us, more
             than once. I won't do it again.

                       AUGUSTUS
             There is no debate. They will be
             sacrificed, so the rest will be
             pure.

   Silus shakes his head.

                       AUGUSTUS
                    (continuing)
             This policeman, Jones. He talked
             to the press. Told them this came
             from Edgar.

   Silus watches Augustus very carefully.

                       AUGUSTUS
                    (continuing)
             There are members of the inner
             circle who question the way you
             have handled this. Blame you for
             this man's actions. I have made it
             clear that you will fix this. That
             you will silence him.

   Augustus moves close to Silus now. Gently touches his face.

                       AUGUSTUS
                    (continuing)
             These are hard things we do. But
             you must think of the greater
             good. And of your own future.

112 INT: JONES APARTMENT, HALL - NIGHT                         112

   Jones exits an elevator. The light above him flickers and
   dies. He stands in the dark.
                                                                      91




                       JONES
             Great.

   Jones begins to stomp down the hall, towards the part of the
   hall that is lit. Then pop, that light goes out as well.

   Jones stops. He pulls out his big gun from his armpit
   holster. He checks over his shoulder, and then with the gun
   extended he moves slowly forward. He approaches an area that
   opens up a little. He pauses, then under his breath.

                       JONES
                    (continuing)
             Come on then...

   He launches himself around the corner and fires his gun. He's
   lucky that his misses his target.

   A small, dirty, cowering boy with his fingers on the bank of
   light switches. The wall next to the boy's head has exploded;
   dust and wall board now drift down like snow.

   Jones can only stare at the quivering child whose dirty face
   blank with fright.

   Then Jones turns. He can make out a figure in the dark hall.
   A patient, quiet sentinel.


113 INT: JONES APARTMENT - NIGHT                                113

   Jones opens the door to his apartment and enters. Silus
   follows. The place is a dump. Lounge and kitchen all one
   area, bedroom off to one side, dishes in the sink, clothes
   everywhere. Jones heads into the kitchen and turns on a
   coffee machine, then grabs a dirty glass, pours a drink.
   Silus watches him.

   Jones comes into the lounge. He still has his gun in his
   hand. He stares at Silus, whose perfect outline makes Jones'
   life seem even more abysmal.

                       JONES
             What do you want?

                       SILUS
             I want to help you. They know you
             talked to the press.

                       JONES
             They can fuck off. For that
             matter, so can you.

   Jones takes a slurp on his drink.
                                                                92



                   JONES
                (continuing)
         You'd be the last person I'd trust.

                   SILUS
         Why?

                   JONES
         I saw you. Remember. Watching
         Lilly, when she was asleep.

Silus doesn't answer now. Jones moves forward.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Maybe you're just like your
         Brother. Maybe you're helping him.
         Now there's a thought.

Jones prods Silus' shoulder with the gun.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         Do you know where she is?

Jones prods again and finds Silus' elegant steel fingers
around his wrist. The two men face off.

                   JONES
                (continuing)
         You've changed. Not the outside.
         But inside. I know you. You know
         what, I can see myself?

Jones tries to wrench his wrist free, but Silus holds it
tight. Jones swings his free arm and smashes Silus on the
side of the face.

For a moment Silus doesn't move, then his hand is around
Jones' throat. Squeezing. Squeezing. His other hand wrenching
the gun from Jones' hand. There is silence in the room, apart
from Jones' choking gags. Then Silus pushes Jones back so
that he flies into a chair. Jones stares up at Silus now,
fear in his eyes. Silus watches him. Then a sound attracts
his attention.

Cut to

Water hisses from Jones' coffee machine in the kitchen.

                   JONES
                (continuing; sneering)
         Coffee's ready.

   Silus, turning, listening, focusing on the water dripping
   from the coffee machine. Silus is concentrating. Realization
   comes into his eyes.

   We zoom close to Silus' ear. The soundtrack becomes enhanced.

   Cut to

   The tap in Jones' festering sink, dripping; plop plop plop.
   We see the water in the bottom of the sink reflecting the
   room. We see Silus approaching; reflected there. His hand
   enters frame and touches the water. And we hear Edgar's
   voice, the words we heard him say in Augustus' office.

                       EDGAR
                    (off)
             You know where I am. Everything
             flows from me...

   We see Silus staring at the water. We see a giant drop of
   water hanging from the tap, hanging, hanging, then falling...

   Cut to


114 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - NIGHT                     114

   We are under water, liquid drops down into the water; red
   liquid, blood. We can see a figure distorted in the water;
   the figure is bleeding himself into the water. It is Edgar.

   Cut to

   We see a subterranean water system. We see Edgar at the edge
   of a pool, bleeding himself into the water supply. Edgar
   looks up. His eyes reflect at us, blinking like an animal's.

   Cut to

   Lilly in her cell, still grinding away at the chains that
   bind her hands. She stops, as if she's heard something,
   expecting Edgar to walk through the doorway. He doesn't. She
   begins desperately grinding away at the chains once more.

115 INT: JONES APARTMENT - CONTINUING                        115

   Back on Silus who now turns to Jones.

                       SILUS
             Do you have a map?

   Cut to
                                                                   94



   Jones laying out a map of the city on his kitchen table;
   empty booze bottles roll out of the way. Jones has a pen and
   he's marking off an area.

                       JONES
             There's the quarantine zone. It's
             a pit. Slums.

                       SILUS
             The water supply. Where is it?

   Jones searches and then pin points an area in the center of
   the quarantine zone.

                       JONES
             There, all the old suburbs are
             supplied by their own artesian
             wells. Mineral springs. That's why
             it hasn't broken out of Jamestown,
             it's the water. Jamestown's water.

   The two men stare at each other, both reaching the same
   conclusion.

                       SILUS
             He is there, with Lilly.

   We see the Map.


116 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - NIGHT             116

   Cut to a crane down to reveal Silus and Jones observing the
   guards at the blockade.

                       JONES
             You'll never get in, they've
             circled the whole borough.

   Silus turns to Jones.

                       SILUS
             I will get in. You must go to the
             press. Tell them about the water.
             Tell them what the government will
             do.

                       JONES
             You're dead after this. You know
             that? Whatever happens.

   Silus smiles.

                       SILUS
             Watch for me, Officer Jones.
                                                                     95




    Silus exits. Jones watches him leave, then Jones leaves too.


117 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS         117

    We see Silus, close. It's as if he is meditating. We pull out
    to reveal he is kneeling on the roof of a building; he looks
    as if he's preparing himself for something.

    He then rises, all fluid concentration, and runs towards us
    and then the camera is on his shoulder as he jumps off the
    roof.

    Cut to

    Silus' POV falling down down, falling towards a window then
    smashing through it.

118 INT: APARTMENT BUILDING, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS     118

    Silus exploding onto the floor of the apartment. For a moment
    there is silence, just glass tinkling, Silus poised. Then
    Silus turns and is gone.

    Cut to


119 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - CONTINUOUS         119

    The slums are wrapped in smoke and haze from fires that burn
    there; an eerie dead zone, made all the stranger by the
    gothic spires that climb out of the haze.

    Then Silus hears something. It is the wailing of a new born
    child. Silus moves towards the cries, then up ahead he sees
    a figure, kneeling on the ground. As Silus moves through the
    haze he sees what it is. It is a Brother Priest, kneeling
    beside someone. The Brother is holding the hand of the person
    on the ground who is in the last throws of death. When Silus
    is next to him the Priest looks up at him. Tears wet his
    cheeks. For a moment they just stare at each other.

                        PRIEST 2
              Who has done this, Brother?

                        SILUS
              We have. To our shame.
                                                                        96




    The Silus hears the babies cries again. Closer now. The
    Priest stares at the dying creature on the ground in front of
    him. Drops the limp hand he was holding. Then rises and turns
    squarely to Silus.

                        PRIEST 2
              I have something to show you.

    The Priest moves off towards a building and Silus follows.

    Cut to


119A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE, HOVEL - CONTINUING    119A

    We see Silus and the Priest enter. The Priest leads Silus
    into the dark place. As he moves forward Silus can hear a
    strange gurgling sound; not of the sick or dying, this is a
    more innocent sound. The sounds of a newborn.

    We See Silus approach a filthy, roughly made crib. In it is
    a baby; it's eyes stare up at Silus with wisdom beyond their
    years.

                        PRIEST 2
              It is a miracle my Brother. She is
              a female, the first of our kind.

    Silus watches the baby carefully.

                        SILUS
              She must be protected.

    He then turns to the Priest.

                        SILUS
                     (continuing)
              I would ask for your help Brother.
              The Church can no longer be
              trusted...


119B EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - CONTINUING                   119B

    Edgar, atop the roof of the building that sits above the
    water treatment plant. He is watching his handiwork; the
    screams in the night, the burning fires, the haze rising up,
    cloaking the city. Then down below, he sees a figure
    approaching. He knows who it is. Silus is coming to him.

    Cut to
                                                                   97




120 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          120

   Lilly, in her cell. She is working the chains that bind her
   hands against the pipe. She's rubbing them desperately,
   harder, harder. Then she stops. She can hear someone
   approaching.

   Edgar appears in the doorway; still and poised. Then he
   turns, listening. A creaking echoes through the tunnels as if
   an iron door, somewhere above, has been opened.

                       EDGAR
             He's coming little one. He's
             coming for you.

   Edgar takes one more blinking look at Lilly and then leaves,
   slamming the large iron door behind him.

   Lilly pulls at the chains, hoping against hope that they'll
   break. They don't.

                       LILLY
             No.

   She now looks above. The pipe her chains are connected to
   runs up towards the roof, then takes a bend to disappear into
   the wall near the door. She bangs on the pipe. There is a
   little movement where it goes into the wall. Just enough to
   give her some hope.

   Lilly struggles now to her feet. She slides the chains up. To
   get the chains over the bend she'll have to jump. She does,
   sliding the chain over the bend. Now she hangs from the pipe,
   the chains cutting into her wrists viciously, making her
   groan. She then gets her hands on the pipe and begins sliding
   along the pipe until she is near the door. She then reaches
   up with her feet and kicks at the wall, pushing, trying to
   dislodge the pipe. It moves, water leaks from it. But it does
   not give way.

   A desperate beat. Then she reaches down to the door with her
   foot. She tries to force down the door handle, her foot wet
   and slippery. Finally she gets the handle down, opens the
   door so that it clangs against the wall.

                       LILLY
                    (continuing)
             Hello! I'm down here. Silus...

   Her hands slip from the pipe and again the chains bite into
   her wrist. She cries out in pain.

   Cut to
                                                                     98


121 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT - CONTINUING                 121

    Above we see Silus, stopping. Lilly's cries echo through the
    place. It is a wet maze of grease and rust, ornate twisting
    pipes built long ago and now decrepit. Silus waits, listens.
    Then something.

    Cut to

    Feet, moving fast, splashing in a pool of black water.

    Silus turns, just catching a movement, a flash of someone
    moving off through the distorted piping. He moves to where he
    saw the figure, to catch sight of a person moving to an open
    iron doorway.

                        SILUS
              Lilly?

    But when the woman turns it is not Lilly. It is one of the
    infected; the red eyes, mad and staring at him. And both he
    and the creature hear it. Cries, of someone in pain. Lilly.

    Cut to


121A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STAIRWELL - CONTINUING     121A

    Lilly's cries echo up the stairwell, up towards the surface.

121C INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT                             121C

    The creature moving through the doorway towards the sounds of
    Lilly's cries. Silus now moves forward to get to the
    creature, flying towards the doorway. We see him approaching
    the doorway and then from nowhere Edgar slams into Silus,
    sending them both careening over a railing.


121D INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STAIRWELL - CONTINUING     121D

    Low Angle looking directly up at the two Brothers fall,
    bouncing and crashing off the rails on the way down.
                                                                       99




121E INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STEAMROOM - CONTINUING       121E

    They both hit the wet stone floor. They are in the pipe room
    where subterranean mineral springs rise up from deep in the
    earth and where the boroughs water supply is sterilized.

    Silus is stunned, rises, blood issuing from his mouth. Silus
    pulls his gun from his coat, but Edgar's kick is too fast,
    whipping the gun away so that the glass instrument smashes
    against some dripping pipes. Edgar then squares off against
    Silus.

                        EDGAR
              It is a maze down here. But given
              time, that thing will find her. Do
              things to her. I'll show you where
              she is, if you take some.

    Edgar stalks forward. He holds up his arm to Silus.

    Silus stares at the tube coming from Edgar's arm. Edgar moves
    towards Silus, twisting on the tube so that his infected
    blood drips onto the ground.

                        EDGAR
                     (continuing)
              You're almost there anyway.

    And then Silus' face, intense, a dark smile, his hand now
    gripping Edgar's hand; surprise in Edgar's eyes.

    He pulls Edgar toward him with all his might, his hand
    clamping onto Edgar's throat - the power of the entwined
    bodies immense - then Edgar whipping his body, breaking
    Silus' grip, smashing Silus on the side of the head, but then
    only to get a kick from Silus directly in the stomach that
    sends him smashing into several protruding pipes, ripping
    into his back. Edgar screams.
                                                                   100



122 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          122

   Lilly. Half conscious now, hanging from the pipe above her,
   twisting. The sound of Edgar's screams makes her groan,
   awaken a little, dazed. Then there is a loud clang. She
   cranes her head to see down the tunnel that leads to her
   cell. She catches sight of a shadow, movement in the tunnel.

                        LILLY
             Silus...
                                                                101


Then the figure moves into the tunnel, shuffling, the legs
not completely following the brains instructions, but doing
enough to propel the person forward, then a stumble. And in
a shaft of light Lilly can see a hand slapping at the wet
wall. But it is less a hand than a claw. And the face that
follows the hand; the red, reflective eyes of one of the half
mad, the infected. The thing catches sight of Lilly, then
propels itself towards her.

We see it's POV, approaching faster, faster.

And Lilly reaching out with her foot, to the door, struggling
to hook it with her foot, trying to close it, almost catching
the door handle, but her foot is so slippery and the thing is
almost on her. Then she stretches out with her foot, just
catching the door and slams it in the face of the thing that
is about to attack her.

The thing on the other side of the door is now screaming
wildly and the door handle is jerking down as the creature
tries to activate it and Lilly has her feet on it, trying
desperately to keep the door shut, but her feet keep
slipping. And then she realizes that the pipe from which she
hangs is beginning to wobble - water is now coursing from the
hole in the wall, beginning to flow faster and faster. Her
feet slip more and more on the door.

Lilly tries to keep the door closed, but her feet are too
slippery and the thing is pushing through the door. In the
dark space only its eyes and slavering mouth are clear, hands
grasping for Lilly legs, scratching at them, Lilly twisting,
the creature's nails searching for purchase on her legs.
Lilly hauls herself up, wrapping her legs around the pipe
she's attached to. The thing below her is groaning
incoherently, reaching up, its hands grabbing at her, Lilly
pulling herself just out of reach, then seeing the eyes below
her, wanting her. Lilly tries to pull herself higher. And
then she feels it. The pipe she's attached to is shifting,
where it joins the wall. Water is now flooding from it, the
pipe jerks down, some of the old wall giving way.

The creature's fingers are now able to grasp Lilly's t-shirt,
drag at it, pull at her, screaming, the pipe grinding, water
flowing and then the whole thing comes down, the pipe
bursting out of the wall.

Lilly and the pipe falls, right on top of the creature.

For a moment neither of them move, then the creature is
grabbing at Lilly's hair, pulling her head back. In a flash
Lilly pulls the pipe to which she is attached right into the
face of the creature. This gives her time to stagger upright.

She's still chained around the pipe; she can see the end of
the pipe near the door.
                                                                        102




    She begins to slide the chains back as the creature begins to
    rise and advance towards her. Lilly desperately slides the
    chain along the pipe. It catches on a protrusion, while the
    creature advances. Lilly frees it just in time, falling
    backwards as the creature jumps at her, Lilly lifting the
    chain up to hold the creature back. The creature strains to
    get at Lilly. Lilly now has the chain at the creature's neck.
    She begins to tighten it around the creature's neck, her only
    hope now. The creature changes now, from frightening to
    pitiful as it realizes it can't breath, it's fingers
    desperately moving over Lilly's face, almost pleading. Tears
    form in Lilly's eyes as she tightens the stranglehold; there
    is no anger there, just desperation, and behind that, pity.

    The creature breathes it's last breath then collapses onto
    Lilly.

124A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STEAMROOM - CONTINUING        124A

    Edgar and Silus stalk each other in the steam room. Edgar
    launches himself towards Silus, but Silus is now too quick.
    Silus slams Edgar sideways into a pipe, an imprint of Edgar's
    face left on the pipe.
                                                                103




Stunned Edgar releases his grip, stumbles back, Silus rising
now, he has him. Again, Silus slams Edgar's head into another
pipe. And now Silus has Edgar's throat in his fist and the
look on Silus' face tells Edgar he will not escape.

We see Edgar, beginning to lose consciousness now, dying.
Steam now rises all around them from broken pipes. Then
behind Silus, Edgar can make something out. An old, corroded
tank, steaming, with the words sterilizer on it. There are a
series of long shafts connected to the sterilizer via a tube
and held in position by clamps; they look like they're for
sterilizing bottles.

With a last effort Edgar propels Silus backwards onto one of
the shafts, making Silus grimace and clutch his back where
he's been pierced, then slide to the ground. The piercing has
operated some lever so that steam now also drifts from the
wound on Silus' back.

Cut to

Silus looking up, clutching his back with the pain of it.

And now Edgar above him. He removes one of the sterilizer
shafts from the bracket that holds it. He clutches a lever on
the side which makes viciously hot steam pulse from the end
of the shaft. Edgar moves slowly towards Silus.

We see Silus, unable to rise, crawling back, until bang, he's
stopped by more pipes behind him. Nowhere to go.

And Edgar ready to pounce. He does, driving the shaft towards
Silus' head. Silus manages to raise one hand to Edgar's wrist
to stop the shaft from piercing his skull. Now the shaft is
right in Silus' face, the lightly steaming hole staring back
at Silus. Edgar's finger moves to the lever on the side of
the shaft, ready to get some steam going.

                   EDGAR
         If I burn the skin from your face,
         I wonder how that would be. If you
         looked like a monster...

Cut to

Edgar's finger moving over the steaming lever. The steaming
end of the shaft right in Silus' face.

Then Edgar's face as he watches his brothers face for the
last time.

The blasting sound of steam and a steaming blast from the
shaft drifts into our frame.

Cut to Silus. His face is not scolded.
                                                                     104




   Cut back to Edgar, his expression getting tighter, his face
   redder, the whites of his eyes becoming bloodshot. Then he
   goes to speak, but now words come out, only a swirling puff
   of steam.

   And then he falls and we see behind him, standing there is
   Lilly, one of the other sterilizing shafts in her hand; steam
   still rising from the sharp end of it.

   Cut to Edgar, prone, on the wet floor of the pipe room; steam
   rises from both his mouth and the back of his head.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


125 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - NIGHT               125

   POV steadicaming through the streets of the Quarantine zone.

   The POV belongs to Lilly who moves down the street, half
   carrying Silus who limps. Lilly takes in the devastation.
   Then Silus pulls up.

                       LILLY
             What is it?

                         SILUS
             In there.

   Silus is pointing to a fallen down building through the haze
   and the rain.

                       LILLY
             Is there something wrong?

                         SILUS
             No.

   He gently touches her mud smeared face.

                       SILUS
                    (continuing)
             There is something very precious.
             You must take it, keep it secret.
             Don't let them touch it.

                       LILLY
             I don't understand.

                         SILUS
             You will.
                                                                      105




   And then they both hear it. A wail, distorted, echoing; it
   sounds like a hurt animal. Lilly looks at Silus.

                         SILUS
                      (continuing)
             Hurry.

   Lilly turns towards the building. She slowly moves towards
   it, into the doorway as Silus watches her go. Silus turns to
   the sunrise, it reflects in his eyes.

   Cut to


126 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE, BUILDING, NIGHT       126

   Lilly moves through the derelict place, past fallen beams. It
   seems empty. Then Lilly hears it again. A wail. This time she
   knows what it is; we can tell from the way her eyes glisten.

   She moves forward, closer to the sound. And finally she sees
   the Brother Priest we saw before, who kneels in front of a
   crate. He looks up at her as she approaches.

   As Lilly moves forward she sees what lies with the crate.
   Wrapped in dirty sacking, there is a baby.

   In the corner Lilly can see a woman - the child's mother -
   dead from the infection.

   The baby cries and Lilly can see the tiny fangs of a Brother
   in the baby's mouth.

                       PRIEST 2
             The first female of her kind. The
             first daughter given to us.

   Lilly moves forward. Emotional music rises in the soundtrack;
   evoking memory, the circle completing. Lilly reaches out,
   letting the baby girl grip her hand. Lilly reaches into the
   crate, drawing the baby into her arms, staring down into the
   baby's face; a face somehow already wise, already serene.
   Broken tears run down Lilly's cheek as she presses the baby
   to herself, all the pain of the past flooding over her, the
   baby's tiny hands reaching out, clasping onto her.

                       PRIEST 2
                    (continuing)
             Come. Before they find her.

   Cut to
                                                                      106




127 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - DAWN                 127

   Lilly exits the building. She looks around for Silus, but he
   has gone. She pauses. Through the mist and drifting smoke
   from the fires we can see that in the distance a tarnished
   sun is lighting the horizon.

                       PRIEST 2
             We must go.

   After a final pause Lilly moves off with the Priest, carrying
   the tiny bundle with her.

                         LILLY
                         (VO)
              For me, everything has changed now.
              Because of Silus I see the world
              through new eyes.

                                            FADE OUT:


128 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              128

   Silus, on a fire escape, in the shadows. Gone are the clothes
   of the Brotherhood, rather he is dressed as someone who does
   not want to be seen.

   Cut to his POV. We see Lilly's building. We see through the
   window, into her apartment; a beacon of warmth in the night.

   In Lilly's bed we can see the baby, its hands happily making
   patterns before its eyes.

                        LILLY
                        (VO)
              Now I see hope, and I see a child,
              the first female of her kind.



   Silus scans the apartment.

   He can see the lounge. Jones is there with Lilly. Lilly is
   dressed to go out; to leave. Jones and Lilly hug. Then Jones
   picks up two suitcases and moves towards the door.

   Silus watches as Lilly moves into the bedroom and reaches
   down for the tiny baby, its tiny arms clasping onto her as
   she lifts it.

                       LILLY
                       (VO)
              Perhaps Edgar got what he wanted
              after all, because it time this
              child will truly change our world.
                                                                107


We see Silus, closer, watching.

Cut to

Lilly, pausing, moving to the window of her apartment,
staring out into the night, almost directly toward Silus. She
raises her hand, as if in a gesture of goodbye and then she
leaves.

Cut to

Silus, close, nodding.

FADE IN ON

that most persistent summer SOUND: crickets in high grass--
ree-ree-ree-ree... This in dark which slowly

						DISSOLVES TO:

EXT.  A GRAVE MARKER  SUMMER DAY

It's a plywood cross leaning aslant. Written on the crossarm in 
black paint which has faded: SMUCKY  HE WAS OBEDIENT. The letters 
are faded. They are also straggling and ill-formed--the work of a 
child.

MAIN TITLES BEGIN.

EXT.  ANOTHER GRAVE MARKER

A child's printing again, this time on a chunk of warped crating: 
BIFFER BIFFER A HELLUVA SNIFFER UNTIL HE DIED HE MADE US RICHER  
1971-1974.

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE

EXT.  TWO MARKERS

I think all these shots are LAP DISSOLVES. All is silence but for 
the crickets and the wind stirring the grass. Around the markers 
themselves, the grass has been clipped short, and by some markers 
there are flowers in cheap vases. Crisco cans, Skippy peanut 
butter jars, etc.

These two markers: IN MEMORY OF MARTA OUR PET RABIT DYED MARCH 1, 
1965 (on a wide flat board) and GEN PATTON (OUR! GOOD! DOG!) APRIL 
1958 (another board).

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE

EXT.  FIVE OR SIX MARKERS

We can't read all of them; some are too faded (or the 
"gravestones" themselves too degenerated), but we can see now that 
this woodland clearing's a rather eerie -- and well-populated -- 
animal graveyard.

We can see: POLYNESIA, 1953 and HANNAH THE BEST DOG THAT EVER 
LIVED. HANNAH'S tombstone is part of an old Chevrolet hood, 
painstakingly hammered flat.

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE.

EXT.  ANGLE ON THE PET SEMATARY

From here we can see most of the clearing, which is surrounded by 
forest pines. We can see that the graves--maybe 80 in all--are 
arranged in rough concentric circles. On the far side of this 
clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard 
clearing. The end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which 
hold up a crude arch. We can see no writing on this side -- the 
words on the arch face those arriving along the path.

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE

EXT.  THE ARCH, FROM THE PATH SIDE, CU

MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE. Written on the arch in faded black paint is 
the work of some long-gone child: PET SEMATARY.

THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO, THEN PANS SLOWLY 
DOWN to look through the arch. From this angle we are looking 
across to a deadfall--a tangle of weather-whitened old dead 
branches at the back of the graveyard. It's maybe twenty-five feet 
from side to side and about nine feet high. At either end are 
thick tangles of underbrush that look impassible.

AS MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE, THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the 
deadfall. And as it does, we realize that there is a horrible 
snarling face in those branches. Is this an accident? Coincidence? 
Our imagination? Perhaps the audience will wonder. THE CAMERA 
HOLDS ON IT and then we

							DISSOLVE TO:

BLACK. And a white title card: MOVING DAY.

EXT.  A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY  EVENING

SOUND of crickets: ree-ree-ree-ree...

To the left of this house: a big empty field. Behind it: the 
woods. Before it: a wide two-lane road.

The house is a pleasant two-story New England dwelling with a 
shed/garage attached. In front of it is a sign which reads QUINN 
REALTORS 292 HAMMOND STREET, BANGOR. A big SOLD strip, like a 
bumper sticker, has been plastered across it diagonally.

GROWING SOUND: the rumble of a truck. A big, big truck. It belts 
between the CAMERA and the house -- a tanker truck with a silver 
body and the word ORINCO written on the side in blue letters. Its 
short-stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke. Behind it 
comes a Ford wagon, which slows, signals, and turns into the 
driveway of the house we've been looking at.

EXT.  REAR OF THE WAGON

As LOUIS CREED brings it to a stop we get a good look at the 
license plate (Illinois) and a bumper sticker (HAVE YOU HUGGED 
YOUR M.D. TODAY?)

The ENGINE SOUND stops. For a moment or two we hear only the ree-
ree-ree-ree of crickets. Then:

				ELLIE CREED (voice)
		Is this our new house, daddy?

				LOUIS CREED (voice)
		This is it.

EXT.  THE WAGON, A NEW ANGLE

The two front doors and one back door open. LOUIS CREED, about 32, 
gets out from the driver's side. RACHEL CREED, his wife, gets out 
from the passenger side. From the rear door comes ELLIE CREED, a 
girl of 6. They are staring, fascinated, at the house.

They come together, the three of them, by the front of the wagon, 
still staring at the house. LOUIS is clearly nervous.

				LOUIS
		So...what do you think?

RACHEL begins to smile. She turns to LOUIS and hugs him.

				RACHEL
		It's gorgeous!

				ELLIE
		Am I really gonna have my own room?

				LOUIS
		Yes.

				ELLIE
		Yaay!

She looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging 
down from the bough of a tree.

				ELLIE (to RACHEL)
		Is that a swing?

				RACHEL
		Yes, but the rope might be--

				ELLIE
		Yaay!

She goes running toward it. RACHEL gives LOUIS a tired smile.

				LOUIS
		Let her go. It's cool.

				RACHEL
		Louis, the house is beautiful.

They kiss--gently at first, then more passionately. As he draws 
her more tightly against him, a baby--GAGE--begins to cry from the 
car. LOUIS and RACHEL break the clinch.

				RACHEL
		The Master of Disaster awakes.

This SOUND is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent-up tomcat.

				LOUIS
		And Buckaroo Banzai.

				RACHEL
		Come on--let's parole 'em.

They walk to the car, RACHEL going to one of the back seat doors, 
LOUIS to the rear of the wagon.

INT.  THE FRONT SEAT, WITH RAHEL AND GAGE

GAGE is sitting in his car seat, not exactly crying but certainly 
yelling to be let out. The seat, dash, and floorboards are 
littered with roadmaps, soda cans, Big Mac boxes, and similar 
crud. These folks have driven all the way from Chicago to Maine in 
this station wagon, and the wagon looks it.

				RACHEL
		Decided to wake up and see what home
		looks like, huh?

She begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses. GAGE is just 
wearing a t-shirt and a diaper. He's fifteen months old.

EXT.  THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS

He opens the doorgate and lifts out a cat carrier. We see a big 
tomcat inside--mostly what we're aware of are shining green eyes.

				ELLIE (voice)
		Daddy! Mommy! I see a path!

LOUIS, cat carrier still in hand, turns toward:

EXT.  ELLIE IN THE TIRE SWING

She's got it penduluming back and forth in long wide arcs.

EXT.  THE VIEW UP TOWARD THE WOODS, ELLIE'S POV

We see the field, and a clearly marked and mown path leading up 
its flank and into the dark woods.

THE CAMERA DIPS AND PENDULUMS as ELLIE swings.

EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE (FRONT OF THE CAR)

				RACHEL (irritated)
		Not so high, Ellie! You don't know
		how strong that rope is.

She puts GAGE down. He totters a bit on his little legs and then 
stands there, looking at his sister.

EXT.  THE ROPE AND THE BRANCH, CU

The bark has rubbed off the branch--it looks like a bone peeping 
through decayed flesh. The rope is old, discolored. And it is 
fraying away as we look at it. Soon ELLIE, like Humpty Dumpty, is 
going to have a great fall.

EXT.  LOUIS (REAR OF THE CAR)

He's set the cat-carrier down and is straightening up.

				ELLIE (raptuous voice)
		Wheee!

				LOUIS
		Ellie, you heard your m---

His eyes widen.

EXT.  ELLIE

				ELLIE
		Wh--

SOUND: A heavy twang! as the rope breaks. The tire swing--with 
ELLIE still inside it--goes crashing to the grass. ELLIE screams 
and begins to cry--a little hurt and a lot surprised.

LOUIS and RACHEL run to her.

			LOUIS				RACHEL
	Ellie! Are you all right?	Honey? Are you okay?

EXT.  ELLIE, RACHEL, LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT

ELLIE'S parents reach the tangle of tire, rope, and six-year-old 
girl.

				ELLIE
		Hurrts! It hurrrrts!

				LOUIS
		Anyone who can scream that loud isn't
		ready for intensive care just yet--
		looks like she just skinned her knee.

Nevertheless, he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from 
the tire. RACHEL helps.

EXT.  GAGE

He's standing in the driveway by the front of the car, utterly 
forgotten in the heat of the moment. His diaper is sagging quite a 
bit; the boy needs a change.

He stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit, then loses 
interest. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he walks down the side of the station 
wagon, little bare feet slapping on the asphalt. He stops for a 
moment at the back, looking at the cat-carrier, which LOUIS never 
got around to opening. CHURCH is staring hopefully out through the 
mesh.

				GAGE
		Hi-Durch!

				CHURCH
		Waow!

GAGE bends down and tries to open the cat-carrier's door. No soap. 
Either he can't solve the latch or his fingers don't have the 
strength. Anyway, he stops trying after a moment.

SOUND: Growing thunder of an approaching truck - a big one.

EXT.  THE ROAD (GAGE'S POV)

A big tanker truck--silver body, ORINCO written on the side in 
blue letters--blasts by.

EXT.  GAGE, BY THE CAT CARRIER

The windlash if the passing truck blows GAGE'S hair back from his 
forehead. We should be scared here--not by the truck, but by 
GAGE'S lack of fear. He's smiling, happy.

				GAGE
		Druck!

He starts down the driveway toward the road.

EXT.  LOUIS, RACHEL, ELLIE (AT THE SWING)

ELLIE has been disentangled from the swing. She's sitting by the 
wreckage at the end of the driveway, weeping hysterically (as much 
from tiredness as from pain, I think) as LOUIS and RACHEL examine 
her scraped knee. The wound doesn't look too serious.

				LOUIS (to RACHEL)
		Would you get the first aid kit?

				ELLIE (screaming)
		Not the stingy stuff! I don't want the
		stingy stuff, daddy!

RACHEL suddenly looks around toward:

EXT.  THE FRONT OF THE WAGON (RACHEL'S POV)

No one there.

EXT.  RACHEL, ELLIE, LOUIS, BY THE SWING

				RACHEL
		Gage's gone!

				LOUIS
		Jesus, the road!

They get up together.

EXT.  GAGE, AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD

A truck is coming. A great big one.

EXT.  ANGLE ON THE TRUCK, CU

The grille looks like a tombstone that's learned how to snarl.

EXT.  GAGE

He takes a step into the road...and then big, gnarled hands grab 
him.

GAGE looks rather surprised at this, but not worried--this kid is 
used to being picked up and treated humanely. To GAGE strangers 
are as interesting as...well, as interesting as Orinco trucks.

EXT.  GAGE AND JUD CRANDALL

The fellow who has picked GAGE up is a man of about eighty in old 
blue jeans, a faded Bruce Springsteen t-shirt. Over this he wears 
a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons. His face is deeply 
wrinkled and kindly.

				JUD CRANDALL (to GAGE)
		No you don't, my friend--not in
		that road.

But he softens this with a grin. GAGE grins back at him.

				GAGE
		Drucks!

				JUD (low)
		No shit, Sherlock.

JUD carries him up the driveway to the station wagon. Here he's 
joined by LOUIS and RACHEL, out of breath and really scared. ELLIE 
brings up the rear. She's still sniffling.

				RACHEL
		Gage!

				JUD (hands him to her)
		He was headed for the road, looked
		like. I corralled him for you, missus.

				RACHEL
		Thank you. Thank you so much.

				LOUIS
		Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.

He sticks out his hand and JUD shakes it. LOUIS takes it easy--no 
crushing JayCees grip, or anything like that--the old guy looks as 
if he might have arthritis.

				JUD
		Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.

				RACHEL
		I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving
		the wandering minstrel boy, here.

				JUD
		No harm, no foul. But you want to watch
		out for that road. Those damn trucks go
		back and forth all day and most of the
		night.

He leans over toward ELLIE.

				JUD
		Who might you be, little Miss?

				ELLIE
		I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642
		Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. (Pause)
		At least, I used to.

				JUD
		And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow,
		and your dad's gonna be the new doctor
		up to the college, I hear, and I think
		you're going to be just as happy as a
		clam here, Ellen Creed.

				ELLIE (to LOUIS)
		Are clams really happy?

They all laugh--even GAGE.

				RACHEL
		Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to
		change this kid. It's nice to meet you.

				JUD
		Same here. Come over and visit when
		you get the chance.

As RACHEL, carrying GAGE, moves away:

				ELLIE (worries)
		Daddy, do I really have to have the
		stingy stuff?

				LOUIS
		No-I guess not.

				ELLIE
		Yayyy!

She goes belting off.

				JUD (amused)
		I guess your daughter there ain't
		going to die after all.

				LOUIS (also amused)
		I guess not.

				JUD
		House has stood empty for too long.
		It's damn good to see people in it again.

SOUND: A truck engine, gearing down.

EXT.  A MOVING VAN

It blinks and comes lumbering into the Creed's driveway.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

				LOUIS
		Hey--they actually found the place!

				JUD
		Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I
		usually sit out on my porch of an evening
		and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner.
		Come on over and join me, if you want.

				LOUIS
		Well, maybe I----

				RACHEL (voice)
		Louis, what's this?

EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE

GAGE has been changed, and RACHEL is following him as he explores 
the nearest edges of the new homestead. They are fairly close to 
the wreckage of the tire swing, and here is the head of the path 
ELLIE has already glimpsed.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

They cross to the van. The FIRST and SECOND MOVERS are just 
climbing out of the van.

				FIRST MOVER
		You Mr. Creed?

				LOUIS
		Yes. Just a second.

EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH

She's holding GAGE on her hip now, and both of them are looking at 
that strange (and oddly enticing) path which disappears into the 
deepening twilight. LOUIS and JUD join them.

				LOUIS
		The movers--

				RACHEL
		Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does
		it go?

				LOUIS
		I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw
		the house, this field was under four feet
		of snow.

				RACHEL (smiling)
		I bet Mr. Crandall knows!

JUD nods. He smiles, too, but underneath the smile we sense that 
he is serious.

				JUD
		Oh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and
		a good walk, too. I'll take you up there
		sometime, and tell you the story, too--
		after you get settled in.

He smiles at them and they smile back--it is a look of 
understanding and real liking, in spite of the age difference 
between the CREEDS and JUD.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT

SOUND: Crickets. Ree--ree--ree-ree... 

There's one light upstairs, one downstairs. Perhaps we see the 
path, glimmering away into the field? Either by virtue of it being 
mown, or by virtue of some gentle optical trick? Maybe.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

There's a light on in the kitchen, but it just casts a dim glow in 
here. The room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor. It's 
going to be nice, but now it's just a big bare box with movers' 
cartons stacked all over the place.

LOUIS is drinking a can of Pepsi, and he looks pretty damned 
tired--anyone who's ever moved house and can remember the first 
night in the new place will understand.

He finishes the last of the Pepsi and surveys the living room. He 
sits on one of the bigger boxes, takes cigarettes from his pocket, 
and lights one. He drops the spent match in the empty can, and 
taps into the can during the scene.

SOUND: Feet coming down the stairs. The door on the far side of 
the room opens and RACHEL comes in, wearing a nightgown.

				RACHEL (crossing to LOUIS)
		Kids are asleep, doc.

				LOUIS
		Great.

He hugs her. She hugs him back warmly--for a moment they are just 
two good people in all the big darkness of their new house.

				RACHEL
		You're not really going over to have a
		beer with that old guy, are you?

				LOUIS
		Well, I've got a million questions about
		the area, and---

				RACHEL
		---and you'll end up doing a free
		consultation on his arthritis or urinary
		problems and---

				LOUIS
		Did you see his shirt?

				RACHEL (giggles)
		Sure. Bruce Springsteen.

				LOUIS
		I really do have a million questions
		about the area...but the thing I'm
		really curious about is how come this
		octogenarian Yankee is decorating the
		slumped remains of his pecs with the
		Boss.

She laughs.

EXT.  THE PATH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE  NIGHT

Pervasive SOUND of the crickets as LOUIS comes rather hesitantly 
up the crazy-paved path from the road's edge.

				JUD (voice)
		That you, doc?

EXT.  THE SCREENED-IN PORCH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE

We hear the SQUEAK of a rocker; we see the dim red fitful glow of 
JUD'S Pall Mall. We see by its glow that he is wearing Walkman 
earphones.

EXT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS
		It's me.

INT.  THE PORCH, WITH JUD

The Walkman is in his lap. He switches it off and puts the 
headphones casually around his neck, like a kid.

				JUD
		Well, come on up and have a beer.

INT.  THE PORCH, A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT

LOUIS comes on up. JUD has got a pail of ice beside his chair with 
some cans of beer in it. He opens one and hands it to LOUIS.

				JUD
		You need a glass?

				LOUIS
		Not at all.

				JUD
		Good for you.

LOUIS drinks half the can at a draught.

				LOUIS
		God, that's fine.

				JUD
		Ain't it just? The man who invented
		beer, Louis, that man was having a
		prime day for himself.

				LOUIS
		What were you listening to?

				JUD
		Allman Brothers.

				LOUIS
		What?

				JUD
		The Eat A Peach album. God, they were
		good before drugs and bad luck caught
		up with them. Listen to this, Louis.

He passes the headphones over. LOUIS puts them on. JUD presses the 
Walkman's PLAY button.

SOUND: Ramblin' Man blasts us out of our seats.

LOUIS winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head.

				JUD
		I'm sorry. Wait.

He turns it down.

				JUD
		Try that.

LOUIS puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments. 
It's the instrumental break. Gregg and Duane Allman dueling hot 
Fenders. LOUIS takes the earphones off.

				LOUIS
		Nice.

				JUD
		I like rock and roll. No...I guess
		that's too mild. I love it. Since
		my ears started to die out on me,
		it's the only music I can really hear.
		And since my wife died...I dunno, some-
		times a little rock and roll fills up
		night. Not always, but sometimes. (Pause)
		One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope
		your time here will be a happy one.

				LOUIS (great sincerity)
		Thank you, Mr. Crandall.

He drinks again--they both do. There's a moment of companionable 
silence here, broken by the SOUND of a big truck. They look 
toward:

EXT/INT.  THE ROAD (THROUGH THE PORCH SCREEN)

One of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by--now there are 
little amber running lights on top of it. It's going fast, too-- 
sweeps by in a blast of air.

INT.  THE PORCH, WITH LOUIS AND JUD

				LOUIS (wincing)
		Jesus!

				JUD (lights a cigarette)
		That's one mean road, all right--you
		remember that path your wife commented on?

				LOUIS
		The one that goes into the woods--sure.

				JUD
		That road--and those Orinco trucks--
		are the two main reasons it's there.

				LOUIS
		What's at the end of it?

				JUD (smiles)
		Another day--after you get settled in a
		bit. Meantime, doc---

Here JUD raises his glass in a toast.

				JUD (continues)
		Here's to your bones.

LOUIS clinks his glass against JUD'S.

				LOUIS
		And yours.

They drink.

EXT.  ROUTE 9  NIGHT

LOUIS crosses from the CRANDALL side to his own, and the CAMERA 
FOLLOWS as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon. He 
pauses for a moment, looking thoughtfully--hopefully--at his new 
house. Then something--the CRY of an OWL, perhaps--draws his 
attention the other way...toward the path.

He walks to its head and stands looking out at it--it glimmers in 
a wide cut swath that's a bit ghostly in the dark.

A SHAPE suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him, and LOUIS 
recoils with a startled, muffled cry.

EXT.  CHURCH

The cat, sure; who--or what--else? We see his big green eyes in 
the dark as he cries his strange feline hello: Waow!

EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH

				LOUIS
		Church! God, you scared the life
		out of me!

				CHURCH
		Waow!

LOUIS bends and picks up the cat. As he does, that truck SOUND 
comes again and he looks toward:

EXT.  THE ROAD, LOUIS'S POV

Another Orinco tanker drones by, fast.

EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH

				LOUIS (to the cat)
		I know one thing that will keep you
		home, good buddy.

He starts toward the house.

BLACK. And in that blackness, we see a second title card: THE DEAD 
SPEAK.

INT.  A KITCHEN BLACKBOARD, CU  DAY

Written on it is: MONDAY 1.) CHURCH SPAYED 10 A.M. QUENTIN 
JOLANDER, D.V.M. And below, in even bigger letters: 2.) ELLIE'S 
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!!

THE CAMERA PANS LEFT, showing us the kitchen. There are still a 
few cardboard cartons around, but the place is getting in shape.

We look out the window and see the CREEDS, led by JUD CRANDALL, 
climbing the path toward the woods. LOUIS has got GAGE in a 
Gerrypak.

EXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH CREEDS AND JUD

They are also at the edge of the woods. JUD stops and lets them 
catch up.

				JUD
		Take a look behind you.

They turn around, and their faces express their wonder.

				LOUIS
		My God!

				RACHEL
		It's beautiful!

EXT.  THE VIEW

It is indeed beautiful. The CREED house is in the f.g., Route 9 
just behind it (with one of the ever-present Orinco trucks droning 
along), but behind that is the great sweep of the Penobscot river 
valley, dozing under a fall sky of clear blue.

EXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH JUD AND THE CREEDS

				JUD
		You folks ready to go on?

				LOUIS
		Sure.

				ELLIE
		But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?

				JUD
		You'll see soon enough, hon.

They go into the woods, still following the path.

EXT.  FOREST  DAY

These are old woods indeed--huge trunks with dusty sunlight 
shafting through them. It looks as though man has never made his 
mark here.

THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN to them, on the path. Here it is 
carpeted with pine needles, but it is just as clearly marked.

JUD stops. LOUIS looks glad of the rest; he's sweating and there 
are wide dark patches under his arms where the Gerrypak's straps 
are.

				LOUIS
		Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper
		companies?

				JUD
		Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up
		ahead is all that's left of their
		tribal lands.

				ELLIE (giggling)
		Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac.

				JUD (smiles)
		Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it?
		You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc?

				LOUIS
		Not yet...how much further is it?

				JUD
		Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.

He starts off again, fresh as a daisy. ELLIE scampers after him. 
LOUIS rolls his eyes at his wife and RACHEL rolls hers back. Then 
they press on.

EXT.  THE ARCH READING PET SEMATARY

EXT.  JUD AND THE CREEDS, ON THE PATH

				JUD (stopping)
		This is the place, honey.

ELLIE is of course second. Se tries to read the words on the arch 
but can't. She whips around to look at her mother.

				ELLIE
		What's it say, mommy?

A strange expression has come over RACHEL'S face--she doesn't like 
this. Not a bit.

				RACHEL
		It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's
		misspelled, but...that's what it
		says.

She runs for the arch. RACHEL starts; looks more uneasy than ever.

				RACHEL
		Ellen--!

EXT.  ELLIE

She's almost under the arch. She looks back, questioning.

EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD

				RACHEL (a bit lame)
		Be careful.

EXT.  ELLIE

She goes racing into the Pet Sematary.

EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD

JUD lights a cigarette with a wooden match, using his thumbnail.

				JUD
		I told you it was a bad road,
		Louis--it's killed a lot of pets
		and made a lot of kids unhappy.
		But at least something good come
		of it. This place.

				ELLIE (excited voice)
		Mom! Dad! Y'oughtta see it!

EXT.  ELLIE, AT THE EDGE OF THE SEMATARY

She surveys the rude markers with puzzled delight, then runs 
toward the center, pausing to investigate some of the markers as 
she goes. We clearly see the symmetrical pattern of rings.

EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD

They are walking slowly toward that rude archway. LOUIS is 
extremely interested in all this, but it's becoming clearer and 
clearer that RACHEL is troubled. They stop and look in.

				RACHEL
		How can you call it a good thing?
		A graveyard for pets killed in the
		road! Built and maintained by broken-
		hearted children!

				JUD
		Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't
		quite that way, deah!

				LOUIS
		I think it's rather extraordinary.

				RACHEL
		Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.

She's growing more and more upset. JUD looks at her curiously.

				JUD
		Well...they have to learn about death
		somehow, now don't they, Missus Creed?
		The little ones?

				RACHEL (coldly)
		Why?

				JUD
		Well...well, because--

				ELLIE (voice)
		Mommy! Daddy! Look at me!

EXT.  ELLIE, ON THE DEADFALL

She has begun to climb it, and this looks like an extremely 
dangerous proposition. ELLIE, however, is having the time of her 
life. A branch breaks under one of her feet and she switches 
nimbly to the next one up.

EXT.  THE GROWNUPS, AT THE ARCH

				JUD (alarmed)
		No, honey! You don't want to go
		climbing on that! Come on down!

He hurries in.

EXT.  ELIIE, ON THE DEADFALL

She looks back at JUD.

				ELLIE
		It's okay, Mr. Crandall--

EXT.  ELLIE'S FOOT, CU

The branch she's on breaks with a dry CRRRACK. Her foot drops down 
suddenly.

EXT.  ELLIE AND JUD

She totters backward, pinwheeling her arms, and JUD catches her as 
she falls. Not much of a catch because she wasn't too far up.

LOUIS joins JUD and ELLIE. GAGE jounces along on his back.

				LOUIS
		Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?

				ELLIE
		Well, I thought it was safe--

				JUD
		Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns
		like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.

				ELLIE
		Bite?

				JUD
		Ayuh.

EXT.  RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH

Her discomfort makes one thing very clear--she doesn't want to 
come in.

				RACHEL (calls)
		Is she all right, Louis?

EXT.  LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE

				LOUIS (calls back)
		Fine! Come and see!

EXT.  RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH

				RACHEL (calling)
		I think I'll sit this one out, doc.

EXT.  LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE--BY THE DEADFALL

				ELLIE
		I want to look around, daddy--
		may I?

				LOUIS
		For a little while.

JUD looks toward:

EXT.  RACHEL AT THE ARCH (ELLEN IN F.G.)

RACHEL has retreated a bit. She sits on the pine needle carpet of 
the path, opens her purse, and draws out cigarettes.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

JUD looks at LOUIS as if to say "What's all this about?" LOUIS 
looks away.

				ELLIE (voice)
		Dad! Daddy! Look! A goldfishie!

EXT.  ELLIE

She runs from one tombstone to the next, cheerful as maybe only a 
kid could be in such a place. She looks at BIFFER'S tombstone; at 
SMUCKY'S.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

They are walking slowly toward her. LOUIS is looking at the 
tombstones.

				LOUIS
		I can hardly read these.

				JUD
		Ayuh--they get older as you go
		toward the middle. (Points) Pete
		LaVasseur's dog is buried there...
		(points) the Stoppard boys' racing
		pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat 
		got...and I think that's the cat 
		himself right there, although it's
		been so many years I can't tell for
		sure.
				(calling)
		Missy Ellen! Come over here just a 
		minute!

EXT.  ELLEN

She runs amid the tombstones--they have worked their way near to 
the center and there are quite a few of them--and joins the 
adults.

				JUD
		I see you're quite a reader for such
		a little girl. Can you read that?

He points again, and Ellen goes over for a look-see.

EXT.  ELLEN, AT THE GRAVE MARKER

It is a small slate marker slanted to one side. ELLEN reads the 
words laboriously, tracing them with her finger.

				ELLEN
		"Spot a good fellow we love you boy."
		(Pause) "Owned by Judson...Judson..."
		Gee, I can't read the rest.

EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS

				JUD
		Last name's Crandall, little missy.

LOUIS looks at him sharply as ELLIE rejoins them.

				JUD
		That's where I buried my dog Spot
		when he died of old age in 19 and
		14. Dug it good and deep. By the
		time I finished, I had blisters all
		over my hands and a hell of a crick
		in my back. Soil's stony up here.

ELLIE looks awed. LOUIS looks a little awed, too.

JUD sweeps a hand around, indicating the whole sematary, but is 
still looking at ELLEN.

				JUD
		Do you know what this place is,
		Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a
		boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing
		and even a whole pile of 'em don't
		amount to much. Do you know what a
		graveyard really is?

				ELLIE
		Well...I guess not.

				JUD
		It's a place where the dead speak,
		Missy.

He sees her startled, uneasy expression and laughs. He ruffles her 
hair reassuringly.

				JUD
		No--not right out loud. Their stones
		speak...or their markers. Even if the 
		marker ain't nothing but a tin can
		someone wrote on with a Magic Marker,
		it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?

				LOUIS
		I think it is so, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		What if you can't read what's
		written on there anymore?

				JUD
		Well, it still says some animal got
		laid down here after, don't it?

				ELLIE
		Yes--

				LOUIS
		And that someone cared enough about
		that animal to mark the spot.

				ELLIE
		To remember.

				JUD (smiles)
		Yes. To remember. This ain't a scary
		place, Ellie. It's a place of rest
		and speaking. Can you remember that?

				ELLIE (a little awed)
		Yes, sir.

They start to walk slowly back toward the arch.

EXT.  RACHEL, OUTSIDE THE ARCH

It's clear she's impatient and out-of-sorts with the whole thing.

				RACHEL (calls)
		Louis, can we go? I'm tired!

EXT.  LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD

				ELLIE
		Mommy! This is a place where dead
		animals talk! Mr. Crandall said so!

EXT.  RACHEL AND ELLIE

But RACHEL is not amused. She doesn't like any of this.

				RACHEL (soft)
		Did he.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

				LOUIS
		My wife is not crazy about cemeteries
		of any kind. As you may have noticed.

				JUD
		Me neither. But I believe in knowing
		your enemy.

LOUIS looks at him, startled, then decides this is a joke. He 
laughs. JUD smiles, a trifle thinly.

EXT.  THE ARCH, A NEW ANGLE

The men rejoin RACHEL and ELLIE.

				LOUIS (voice)
		Did we take too long?

				RACHEL (curt)
		Well, if supper's burned, I'm not
		the one going out for pizza.

They move away.

EXT.  THE DEADFALL, FROM THE ARCH

The face we saw at the beginning of the movie wasn't there when 
the visitors were there...but it's sure there now, leering at us.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TRASH CAN  NIGHT

There are two greasy boxes poking out with NAPOLI PIZZA stamped on 
them. Guess dinner was burned.

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK and we se LOUIS sitting at the kitchen 
table. The table is covered with newspapers. On it, LOUIS is 
putting together a complicated model boat, using glue and 
tweezers. He's wearing glasses.

ELLIE comes in, wearing a nightgown. She watches him for awhile.

				LOUIS (not looking around)
		Hi, babe.

				ELLIE
		Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there
		because of the road, isn't it?

LOUIS looks around at her, surprised.

				ELLIE
		That's what I think. I heard
		Missy Dandridge tell Mom when
		Church was fixed he wouldn't
		cross the road so much.

				LOUIS
		Well, it's always better to take
		precautions--but I'm sure Church
		will be all right, honey...

INT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN DOOR

RACHEL is coming along with some dirty dishes. She hears voices 
and stops, listening, her face troubled and afraid.

				ELLIE (voice)
		No he won't! Not in the end! He won't
		be all right in the end no matter how
		you fix 'im!

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

Ellis has started to cry.

				ELLIE
		In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?

				LOUIS
		Lovey...Church might be still alive when
		you're in a high school...and that's a
		very long time.

				ELLIE
		It doesn't seem long to me. It seems
		short. I think the whole thing about
		pets dying s-s-sucks!

Poor kid's bawling her eyes out now. LOUIS folds her into his arms 
and she hugs him tightly, wanting his comfort.

				LOUIS
		If it was up to me I'd let Church live
		to be a hundred...but I don't make up
		the rules.

				ELLIE (muffled)
		Well who does? God, I suppose. But he's
		not God's cat! He's my cat! Let God get
		His own, if He wants one! Not mine! Not
		mine! Not--

She breaks down completely, sobbing, and LOUIS rocks her back and 
forth.

INT.  THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL

She is crying silently.

INT.  ELLIE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

She is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness. An oblong shaft of 
light falls on her, illuminating her more clearly. She's asleep 
with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her 
mouth.

INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH RACHEL

RACHEL looks at her daughter with infinite love and then quietly 
closes the door.

INT.  LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

LOUIS is in his pajamas, propped up on pillows on his side of the 
bed. There a number of medical books scattered around him and he's 
making notes from one as RACHEL comes in.

				RACHEL
		She's finally asleep.

				LOUIS
		She was a little over-excited,
		that's all. Poor kid.

				RACHEL
		It was that place. That creepy cemetery
		up in the woods. Whatever disease the
		kids in this town have got, I don't want
		Ellie to catch it.

				LOUIS
		Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?

				RACHEL
		Do you think I didn't hear her tonight,
		crying as if her heart would break?
		Here she is thinking Church is going to
		die.

It should be clear to us by now that, despite her words, RACHEL is 
much more upset than ELLIE was. LOUIS slowly puts his notebook 
aside and caps his pen.

				LOUIS
		Rachel...someday Church is going to 
		die.

				RACHEL (whirls on him)
		That is hardly the point! Church is
		not going to die today, or tomorrow--
		Never mind. I can see you don't have
		the slightest idea what I'm talking about.

She stalks to the bathroom, which adjoins. LOUIS follows. She goes 
in and slams the door. He goes for the knob.

				LOUIS
		Rachel--!

SOUND: CLICK OF THE LOCK.

LOUIS stares at the door, bewildered and upset.

EXT.  ROUTE 9  NIGHT

Here comes a big Orinco truck, droning along, headlights glaring.

INT.  LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM

The headlights of the truck illuminate the room and we see LOUIS 
and RACHEL asleep, each as far over to his/her own side as he/she 
can get, with a big empty space in the middle.

Lights and TRUCK SOUNDS slowly fade.

INT.  GAGE  MORNING

Cheerful little clots of scrambled eggs are scattered all the way 
across the tray of his high-chair--it looks a little like a map of 
the Pacific islands done by a guy who only had a yellow crayon. 
Now he scoops up a handful and throws them.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE

Splat! Eggs on the serving plate of toast.

				ELLIE
		Yee-uck! Gross!

INT.  THE KITCHEN, A WIDER SHOT

RACHEL is at the sink, doing dishes (we see the blackboard with 
its message near her).

LOUIS comes in, wearing a sport-coat and slacks, ready for his 
first day on the job...and ELLIE is in a pretty first day of 
school dress.

				LOUIS
		He can't help it, babe. Emily Post is
		going to be beyond him for a few years.

INT.  BY THE KITCHEN DOOR

Here is the cat-carrier with CHURCH inside it. He waows unhappily.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE AND GAGE

ELLIE gets down and goes across to the cat-carrier.

				ELLIE
		I don't want him to get his nuts
		cut, daddy! What if he dies?

INT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK

LOUIS looks shocked and amused by ELLIE'S colorful choice of 
words.

				LOUIS
		Good God! Where'd you hear that?

INT.  ELLIE

				ELLIE
		Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a
		operation!

INT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK

LOUIS tries to kiss RACHEL'S mouth. She turns her head slightly so 
he gets her cheek instead. She's still mad. LOUIS'S amusement 
dies.

				RACHEL
		Honey, Church will be fine.

INT.  ELLIE, BY THE CAT CARRIER

				ELLIE
		But what if he dies and has to
		go to the Pet Sematary?

INT.  LOUIS AND RACHEL, BY THE SINK

She gives him a look as if to say: "There! Now do you understand 
what you did?"

				RACHEL
		Don't be silly. Church is not going
		to die.

				LOUIS
		According to what Mr. Crandall says, the
		road's a lot more dangerous than the
		operation. Church will be just the same.
		Well--almost the same--and we won't have
		to worry about him getting turned into
		catburgers by one of those damn Orinco
		trucks.

At this RACHEL tightens up still more in that funny way--she's 
actually angered by LOUIS'S reference to catburgers--but under the 
anger we sense she is deeply shocked, as a prudish woman might be 
shocked by a dirty joke. For RACHEL, that's just what death is.

				RACHEL
		That's enough of that kind of talk!

				LOUIS
		I just said--

				RACHEL
		I know what you just said. Ellie,
		clear your place.

ELLIE goes slowly back to the table.

				ELLIE (sets the plate down)
		I'm scared. What if school here isn't
		like in Chicago! I'm scared and I want
		to go h-h-home!

ELLIE bursts into loud tears and puts her hands over her face.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, A NEW ANGLE (FEATURES LOUIS AND RACHEL)

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they go to the table to comfort ELLIE.

				RACHEL
		You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be
		excused. Go and wash your face.

				LOUIS
		And Church will be fine.

				ELLIE (anxious)
		Do you promise, Daddy?

				LOUIS
		Well, honey...you know that...

				RACHEL
		Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give
		the little girl her promise.

				LOUIS (reluctantly)
		Church will be fine. I promise.

				ELLIE
		Yayyyy!

She runs off, cheered up. And RACHEL is cheered up, too.

				RACHEL
		Thank you, Louis.

				LOUIS
		Oh, you're welcome. Only if some-
		thing should go wrong while he's under
		the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot,
		but it happens--you explain to her.

He gets up and leaves the table. She looks after him, stunned and 
a little frightened.

INT.  GAGE

				GAGE (conversationally)
		Here, Durch!

He picks up a large glob of scrambled eggs from his tray and 
throws it in the direction of the cat-carrier.

INT.  THE CAT-CARRIER

CHURCH is close to the mesh, looking out. Scrambled eggs hit the 
mesh, driving him back, surprised.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING

The school bus pulls up, red lights flashing. ELLIE runs toward it 
across the lawn, with her lunch-box.

EXT.  LOUIS, RACHEL, AND GAGE, IN THE FRONT DOORWAY

				RACHEL
		Have a great day!

LOUIS grabs GAGE'S hand and makes him wave it.

				GAGE
		Bye-bye!

EXT.  THE BUS

ELLIE climbs aboard. The red flashers go out and the bus pulls 
away.

EXT.  THE CREED DRIVEWAY  MORNING

The station wagon is parked there. LOUIS comes out with a heavy 
briefcase in one hand and the cat-carrier in the other. He opens 
the wagon's doorgate.

A small car turns into the CREED driveway and parks beside LOUIS. 
A rather sour-looking middle-aged woman gets out and crosses the 
front of her car. Her color is bad. This is MISSY DANDRIDGE. She 
looks at the cat-carrier.

				MISSY
		Gonna get his--

				LOUIS
		--nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy,
		for introducing that colorful phrase
		into my daughter's vocabulary.

				MISSY
		Don't mention it.

She opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat 
pile of folded sheets. She reaches for them, then winces and 
presses her hands against her midriff for a moment, as if with an 
attack of indigestion.

				LOUIS (sees this)
		How's that belly-ache of yours?

				MISSY (gets the sheets)
		No better and no worse.

				LOUIS
		You ought to see a doctor about it.

				MISSY
		It'll pass. They always do.

She starts toward the house with the sheets.

EXT.  THE SIDE YARD  MORNING

RACHEL hurries past MISSY, who turns to look and then goes on into 
the house. LOUIS has just put the cat-carrier into the back of the 
wagon and closed the doorgate as RACHEL reaches him.

				RACHEL (anxious)
		Still friends, doc?

LOUIS appears to consider this seriously for a moment...and then 
he smiles and hugs her. They kiss.

				RACHEL
		Thank God. I was a little worried
		there. Have a great first day at
		school, doc. No broken bones.

				LOUIS (smiles)
		Not so much as a sprain.

EXT.  VICTOR PASCOW AND FRIENDS  MORNING

PASCOW is in a blanket that is being carried by three boys and one 
girl. They are all yelling at each other not to joggle him, not to 
drop him. A small knot of horrified college kids moves with the 
bearers.

PASCOW'S head is upside down to the CAMERA, which retreats ahead 
of the advancing students. Fixed eyes stare. Half of his head has 
been shattered inward. Before the catastrophe he was a husky male 
of about twenty. He's dressed in a U of M muscle shirt and red 
jogging shorts.

THE CAMERA PULLS JERKILY TO ONE SIDE, allowing the bearers to 
mount the steps of a brick building. The infirmary. The lookers-on 
break to either side. The infirmary doors open.

EXT.. NURSE CHARLTON, AT THE DOORS

She's the head nurse, a tough old babe of about fifty.

				CHARLTON
		Holy Jesus.
				(turns)
		Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed! Dr. Creed,
		we've got a mess here! Stat!

The bearers sweep past her and inside, leaving a red smear of 
blood across the midriff of MARCY CHARLTON'S uniform.

INT.  THE INFIRMARY RECEPTION AREA

THE CAMERA will show us all we need to see, but its movements will 
seem almost random; this is like being in the hotel kitchen after 
Sirhan shot Bobby.

As the students bring in PASCOW, LOUIS comes running, followed by 
STEVE MASTERTON, his P.A. Standing to one side are two student 
nurses in candystriper uniforms. They're boggled and horrified.

LOUIS kneels. THE CAMERA RUSHES FORWARD, shoving between 
onlookers. LOUIS looks at the wound. There's shattered bone and 
pulsing brain tissue beneath.

There's a scream; the girl who was carrying one corner of the 
blanket is having hysterics.

				GIRL
		Vic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic!

				LOUIS (to CHARLTON)
		Get her out. Get them all out.

CHARLTON puts her arms around the girl.

				GIRL (struggling)
		No! No! He can't die! He can't die!

THE CAMERA MOVES BACK DOWN as LOUIS takes an opthalmascope from 
STEVE and shines it in PASCOW'S bulging, fixed eyes.

CHARLTON is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out 
the door.

				LOUIS
		Steve, get the ambulance over here
		right now. He's got to go to EMMC.

				STEVE
		The ambulance is at Sonny's Sunoco
		downtown, getting--

				LOUIS
		--a new muffler, oh shit--

PASCOW makes a weird gargling noise. Blood suddenly spurts out of 
his mouth. He begins to seizure.

One of the candystripers shrieks. THE CAMERA JERKS UP TO COVER the 
student nurses. One turns and throws up on the wall.

CHARLTON rushes over.

				CANDYSTRIPER
		I can't look at it...I can't stand it...

				CHARLTON (slaps her)
		Yes you by God can. Go get the hard
		stretcher!

As they start away, one helping the other down the hall, and as 
CHARLTON starts over to where PASCOW lies dying on his blanket, 
THE CAMERA DROPS TO LOUIS AND STEVE.

				LOUIS
		Help me hold him.

They hold PASCOW'S spasming body.

				STEVE
		It wouldn't matter if we did have
		the ambulance.

				LOUIS
		It wouldn't matter if we had the SST.

PASCOW begins to quiet.

				LOUIS
		He's going. Steve, go call the motor-
		pool. Marcy, roll out the crash wagon.

				CHARLTON
		It won't--

				LOUIS
		I know it won't! But let's for God's
		sake do it by the rules!

She leaves. LOUIS is alone with PASCOW. CHARLTON has drawn the 
drapes, so the doctor and the dying man have complete if temporary 
privacy.

INT.  LOUIS AND PASCOW, A CLOSER SHOT

				LOIS
		There wasn't even supposed to be a
		sprain today, my friend--that's what
		I told her.

PASCOW'S fixed eyes suddenly roll and his left hand bear-traps 
LOUIS'S right wrist. The dying man pulls him slowly but 
relentlessly down, until their faces are only inches apart.

				PASCOW
		...Pet Sematary...

LOUIS recoils, breaking the grip of the hand...but he cannot quite 
snap the grip of those bright dying eyes. Blood leaks from 
PASCOW'S mouth.

				LOUIS (whispers)
		W-What did you say...?

PASCOW struggles hard to speak again. At first he can only gurgle.

				PASCOW
		It's not the real cemetery...
		(Long pause) The soil of a man's
		heart is stonier, Louis...a man
		grows what he can...and tends it.

LOUIS leans forward again, terrified, yet needing to know.

				LOUIS
		How do you know my name?

				PASCOW (gurgling)
		I'll come...to you.

LOUIS grabs PASCOW'S bloody shoulder.

				LOUIS (low but urgent)
		Dammit, how do you know my name?

INT.  HALLWAY ENTRANCE TO RECEPTION, WITH STEVE

				STEVE
		Louis, they're sending a--

INT.  LOUIS AND PASCOW

PASCOW begins to spasm again.

				LOUIS (snaps)
		Help me!

PASCOW spews more blood as STEVE kneels beside LOUIS.

INT.  THE MAIN INFIRMARY HALLWAY

CHARLTON is pushing along your basic MEDCU goodie-cart, covered 
with emergency life-saving gear.

INT.  LOUIS, STEVE, PASCOW

PASCOW'S spasms are weakening.

				LOUIS (to CHARLTON)
		Never mind. He's going.

PASCOW'S hand comes up and paws at LOUIS'S shirt, leaving a bloody 
handprint. Then it falls limply back. PASCOW is dead.

				LOUIS
		Steve, will you get a sheet to cover
		him with?

STEVE leaves the frame and LOUIS stares fixedly down at the body 
of VICTOR PASCOW. He closes the eyes.

EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, LATE AFTERNOON

It's the leading edge of Maine fall, sunny and wonderful. Here 
comes LOUIS'S station wagon. As it reaches THE CAMERA, it swivels 
to TRACK.

				RADIO (voice-over)
		Tragedy struck on the first day of the
		University of Maine's fall semester 
		when Victor Pascow, a nineteen-year-old
		sophomore--

INT.  THE CAR, WITH LOUIS

He still looks shocked by the tragedy. The dying man's bloody 
handprint is partly visible on LOUIS'S shirt in spite of his 
sport-coat.

LOUIS abruptly turns off the radio and swerves over to the side of 
the road.

EXT.  THE STATION WAGON

IT comes to a slueing, shuddering stop, almost going in the ditch.

INT.  LOUIS, BEHIND THE WHEEL

				LOUIS
		He said my name. I heard it. He
		said my name.

He stares blankly through the windshield.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT

All lights are off. It's late.

INT.  THE CREED BEDROOM  NIGHT

LOUIS and RACHEL are asleep, each on his/her own side of the big 
double. THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON LOUIS.

SOUND: Loud, hollow BANG. It's very loud--loud enough to wake the 
dead.

LOUIS sits up. Beside him, RACHEL sleeps on. LOUIS'S eyes widen in 
terror as he stares at:

INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH PASCOW

He's exquisitely dead. Now pallid as well as smashed up.

				PASCOW
		Come on, doc. We got places to go.

INT.  LOUIS

He is in terror...but he is also in a state of near-trance.

INT.  PASCOW

				PASCOW
		Come on, doc--don't make me tell you
		twice.

INT.  LOUIS

He glances at RACHEL. Although PASCOW has spoken in a fairly loud 
voice--and the opening door was like a bomb--she's still fast 
asleep. LOUIS looks back toward PASCOW...and then gets out of bed. 
He's naked except for a pair of pajama bottoms.

INT.  PASCOW

He turns and leaves the doorway.

INT.  LOUIS

He reaches the bedroom doorway himself and looks back at:

INT.  THE BED, LOUIS'S POV

RACHEL is sleeping as before, and LOUIS himself is also in bed 
asleep, although his rest is uneasy...as if he's having a bad 
dream.

INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH LOUIS

				LOUIS (relieved)
		Oh. Thank God.

				PASCOW (Voice)
		Hurry up, doc.

INT.  THE KITCHEN

LOUIS enters and crosses toward the door which gives on the 
shed/garage. This door stands open. LOUIS pauses by it.

				PASCOW (low)
		Come on, doc...

LOUIS goes into:

INT.  THE SHED/GARAGE

The station wagon is a dark hulk. LOUIS crosses to it and stands, 
perplexed.

PASCOW looms softly behind him and puts an arm around him. LOUIS 
turns... and suddenly his face is less than an inch from PASCOW'S 
mutilated face.

				PASCOW
		Let's go, doc.

				LOUIS (moans)
		I don't like this dream.

				PASCOW
		Who said you were dreaming?

He begins to move toward the garage door. After a moment LOUIS 
follows him.

EXT.  THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE, LONG  NIGHT

We can see two shapes moving up the path toward the woods--PASCOW 
and, behind him, LOUIS.

EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY ARCH

CAMERA HOLDS, THEN PANS DOWN as LOUIS passes under the arch.

EXT.  LOUIS, CLOSE

He looks around, obviously afraid.

EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV

We can see why. By starlight this is one scary place.

EXT.  LOUIS

He suddenly sees something else, and now his fear is close to 
terror.

EXT.  THE DEADFALL, LOUIS'S POV

The face is back in the tumbled branches. It yawns and snarls.

EXT.  LOUIS

He walks toward the deadfall as if hypnotized. PASCOW'S hand falls 
on his shoulder. LOUIS turns, terrified.

EXT.  PASCOW, CLOSE

He really is a dreadful mangled mess.

				PASCOW
		This is the place where the dead speak.

EXT.  LOUIS

He closes his eyes.

				LOUIS
		I want to wake up. I want to wake up,
		that's all. I--

EXT.  LOUIS AND PASCOW

				PASCOW
		The door must not be opened. The
		barrier must not be crossed. Don't
		go on, doc. No matter how much you
		feel you have to. There's more
		power here than you know.

He points at:

EXT.  THE DEADFALL

That grinning face--and perhaps now there are other effects as 
well, subtle but there? Dim red light? A misty smoke drifting 
through the tumbled dead branches? The director will know.

After a moment there is a HUGE GRUNTING ROAR from the woods behind 
the deadfall--it sounds like no animal we've ever heard before. 
There is the sound of something huge shifting and snapping a tree 
like a toothpick.

EXT.  PASCOW AND LOUIS

LOUIS has crumbled to PASCOW'S feet. His eyes are squeezed tightly 
shut.

				LOUIS
		Please, I want to wake up. Leave me 
		alone. It's not my fault you died; you 
		were as good as dead when they brought
		you in--

				PASCOW
		The power of this place is old and
		always restless. Sometimes the dead
		do more than speak. Remember, doc.

CAMERA BEGINS MOVING SLOWLY IN ON LOUIS.

				LOUIS
		Leave me alone!

				PASCOW
		Remember.

CAMERA IS TIGHT ON LOUIS.

				RADIO (voice)
		--another beautiful day in Maine!
		This is Michael O'Hara sayin' that
		the git-go ain't gonna be that bad.
		Temps are going all the way up to 70...
		We got the Ramones for Ludlow...here's
		"Sheena."

As the Ramones start blasting "Sheena Is A Punk Rocker":

INT.  LOUIS, IN BED

His eyes snap open. He's in his own bedroom. As he sits up THE 
CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS OUT so we can see that he's in bed alone; the 
covers on RACHEL'S side are thrown back.

After the initial confusion and fear, LOUIS looks deeply relieved;
he looks the way I suppose we all look upon waking up and 
realizing our worst dreams were only dreams after all.

				RACHEL (calls)
		You up, doc?

				LOUIS
		Getting there.

				RACHEL
		I got eggs down here!

				LOUIS
		Good d--

He throws the covers back and freezes.

INT.  LOUIS'S FEET, LOUIS'S POV

They are covered with mud and pine needles. The sheets are greased 
with woods-muck.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

Utter terror.

INT.  THE LAUNDRY CHUTE, CU

LOUIS'S hands enter the shot and dump a bundle of sheets into the 
chute.

INT.  LOUIS, IN THE UPSTAIRS HALL

He's naked but for a towel around his waist. He's obviously fresh 
from the shower.

He starts down to the bedroom to dress.

BLACK. And on it a third title card: CHURCH.

Over this the SOUND of a RINGING TELEPHONE.

				LOUIS (voice)
		Hello?

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM  AFTERNOON

There's a bowling match on TV. LOUIS, dressed in his Saturday 
afternoon grubs (jeans and a Maine sweatshirt), has the phone to 
his ear.

				JUD CRANDALL (phone filter)
		Louis? 'Fraid you may have a spot of
		trouble.

				LOUIS (frowning)
		Jud? What trouble?

INT.  THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD

He's on the phone, looking out his window.

				JUD
		Did you tell me Rachel took the
		kids back to Chicago for a few days?

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS

				LOUIS
		For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't
		go because her old man thinks I'm a
		shit and the feeling is heartily re-
		ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow
		night. Jud, what's this about?

INT.  THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD

				JUD
		Well, there's a dead cat over here on
		the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it
		might be your daughter's.

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS

				LOUIS
		Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL HOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG

We're looking across from the CREED lawn. LOUIS waits for one of 
those trucks to go blasting by and then crosses. It's cold and 
windy. Downed autumn leaves fly.

LOUIS and JUD stand over a small furry body like mourners.

				JUD (voice)
		Well?

EXT.  THE CAT'S BODY

It's lying on its belly and doesn't look much damaged. Hands--
LOUIS'S--come into the frame. He puts one hand under the cat's 
head and lifts it so the open eyes, now a dull green, stare into 
THE CAMERA. There's some blood on its ruff. That's all.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, ON THE EDGE OF THE CRANDALL LAWN

				LOUIS
		It's Church.

				JUD
		I'm sorry. At least it don't look like
		he suffered.

				LOUIS
		Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.

From his jacket pocket he takes a green plastic garbage bag and 
hands it to JUD. JUD holds the bag's mouth open on the ground 
while LOUIS kind of shoves the body in. During this:

				JUD
		Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?

				LOUIS
		Yes.

LOUIS twists the bag shut and puts one of those plastic ties on 
it. Then he holds it up.

				LOUIS
		Bagged cat. What a mess.

				JUD
		You going to bury him in the Pet
		Sematary?

				LOUIS (a little bitter)
		I guess that's what it's there for, huh?

During all of this JUD has grown peculiarly intense.

				JUD
		Going to tell Ellie?

				LOUIS
		I don't know.

				JUD
		Seems like you told me about a promise
		you made--

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN  MORNING

GAGE is in his high chair. ELLIE, in her first-day-of-school 
dress, is in her place. LOUIS is sitting at his own place staring, 
hypnotized, at the middle of the table, where there is a large 
serving dish. On the dish is scrambled eggs, strips of bacon, and 
CHURCH'S corpse--staring eyes, bloody ruff and all.

				RACHEL (impatiently)
		Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the
		little girl her promise.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL LAWN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS

				LOUIS (defensive)
		That was a mistake. But Rachel...
		she doesn't like to talk about
		death, or even think of it. Her
		younger sister died of spinal
		meningitis when Rachel was eight.
		Rachel was there when it happened.
		Alone. I guess you could say it
		made a complex.

				JUD
		Cat's just as dead, Louis.

				LOUIS (snaps)
		Well that's a big help! (Pause) I'm
		sorry, Jud.

				JUD
		No need to apologize.

				LOUIS
		Maybe when they call I'll just tell
		Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat
		around. You know?

				JUD (after a long pause)
		Maybe there's a better way.

EXT.  THE START OF THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LONG  EVENING

LOUIS and JUD cross the road from the CRANDALL side. LOUIS is 
carrying the plastic bag in one hand and a flashlight in the 
other. JUD has a pick and shovel in one hand and a flashlight of 
his own in the other.

Evening shadows have grown long. It's maybe an hour until dark.

JUD and LOUIS stop near the replaced tire-swing.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

JUD has a Walkman clipped to the belt of his pants and earphones 
slung around his neck.

				LOUIS
		Jud, this is crazy. It's going to
		be almost dark before we get back.

				JUD
		It's going to be dark before we even
		get where we're going, Louis. But
		we can do it...and we're going to.

				LOUIS
		But--

				JUD
		Does she love the cat?

				LOUIS
		Yes, but--

				JUD
		Then come on.

He puts the earphones on, effectively forestalling further 
argument, and pushes the PLAY button on the Walkman. We can hear 
Marshall Crenshaw singing "Crystal Girl." JUD starts away. After a 
moment, LOUIS follows.

EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY AND THE BACK OF THE ARCH  LATE EVENING

The SOUND of crickets...ree-ree-ree...

The SOUND of footfalls.

Faintly, the SOUND of Huey Lewis and the News, singing "Working 
For A Living."

It's now almost twilight.

JUD and LOUIS enter the Pet Sematary. LOUIS is looking around 
curiously.

				LOUIS
		Well, folks, here we are, in Louis
		Creed Dreamland.

JUD snaps off the Walkman and puts the earphones around his neck 
again.

				JUD
		What say, Louis?

				LOUIS
		Nothing. (Pause) Do we plant him on
		the outer circle or start a new one?

				JUD
		We're still not where we're going.

He walks past LOUIS and toward the deadfall. LOUIS follows.

				LOUIS
		What do you mean?

				JUD
		The place we're going is on the
		other side of that.

He points at the deadfall.

				LOUIS
		We can't climb over that. We'll break
		our necks!

				JUD
		No. We won't. I have climbed it a time
		or two before, and I know all the places
		to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't
		look down...and don't stop. If you stop,
		you'll crash through for sure.

				LOUIS
		I'm not climbing that.

				JUD
		Give me the cat. I'll take care of it
		myself.

He holds out his hand and LOUIS sees the old man means exactly as 
he says. After a moment he says:

				LOUIS
		Let's go.

JUD starts up one side of the deadfall, and in spite of its 
snarled tangles, he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of 
stairs. After a few second, LOUIS follows.

				LOUIS (low)
		Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up.

EXT.  THEIR FEET

First JUD'S pass THE CAMERA, then LOUIS'S, partly obscured by the 
swinging cat-bag. Their feet unerringly find the right branches 
and just as unerringly miss holes which look like ankle-breakers.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's grinning, exhilarated.

				LOUIS
		God, this is amazing!

EXT.  JUD

There are beads of sweat on the old man's face. He looks both 
stern and a little scared.

				JUD
		Just don't stop and--

EXT.  LOUIS

He looks down.

EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET

A dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot 
plunges down maybe six inches.

EXT.  LOUIS

He lurches to the edge of balance, then regains it.

				LOUIS
		And don't look down. Right.

He continues.

EXT.  THE DEADFALL, REVERSE  TWILIGHT

JUD reaches the top and starts down the far side. LOUIS reaches 
the top.

EXT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS (amazed)
		Holy...!

EXT.  BIG GOD WOODS, LOUIS'S POV

In the dying glow of twilight, this should be a mystic, awe-
inspiring shot. There's no more scrub underbrush and junk pines 
and juniper-bracken here; ancient firs rise almost like Sequoias. 
The sunset light shafts among them. This is a real forest... an 
old forest. And winding upward among the trees along that needle-
carpeted floor, clearly marked by large white stones, the path 
goes on.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's stopped on top of the deadfall, still surveying all this with 
frank amazement.

EXT.  JUD

				JUD (turns to look)
		Come on, Louis--don't stop!

EXT.  LOUIS, ATOP THE DEADFALL

				LOUIS (grinning)
		I'm all right! I'm f--

EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET

One of the branches snaps. LOUIS'S foot plunges. His cuff rips.

EXT.  LOUIS, JUD'S POV

We're looking up at a fairly steep angle as LOUIS staggers off-
balance. He steps with his other foot, misses, and goes flying.

EXT.  LOUIS, CLOSER

He does a half-somersault in the air and hits the deadfall on his 
back, the green garbage bag flying out of his hand. His flashlight 
also goes. Branches crack. White dust puffs out from under him.

EXT.  JUD, AT THE BASE OF THE DEADFALL

LOUIS thumps to the ground nearby. JUD kneels beside him.

				JUD
		Louis! You all right?

LOUIS sits up groggily. His pants are torn. His sweatshirt is 
torn. His ankle is bleeding.

				LOUIS (dazed)
		Sure. I guess I just lost my happy 
		thoughts for a second there.

LOUIS gets slowly up and retrieves the bag, which is rather 
shredded now--and we can see catfur through some of the rents.

				LOUIS (continues)
		I shouldn't have stopped...and it
		does bite.

He whaps the flashlight against his palm a time or two and the 
light comes on. Satisfied, he shuts it off.

				JUD
		No, you shouldn't have stopped. But
		you got away with it. Important thing
		is are you sure you're all right?

				LOUIS
		Yes. (Pause) Where are we going, Jud?

				JUD
		You'll see before long. Let's go.

He starts off up the path. After a moment LOUIS follows, carrying 
the bag.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, FROM THE DEADFALL

Again, there should be a sense of awe and mystery as they go 
tolling up the path into the twilight, dwarfed by those ancient 
firs.

SOUND OF CRICKETS, LOW at first, then UP TO LOUD: Ree-ree-ree...

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP  TWILIGHT

Lots of undergrowth here, and creeping ground-mist, too. The SOUND 
OF CRICKETS is now only a part of the soundtrack: BUZZ OF CICADAS, 
THUMP OF FROGS. Swamp-sounds.

LOUIS looks frankly doubtful.

				JUD
		This next bit's like the deadfall, Louis--
		you got to walk steady and easy. Just follow
		me and don't look down.

EXT.  LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S AND JUD'S POV  DEEP TWILIGHT

Mysterious...awesome...scary. Dead trees poke out of the murk like 
twisted hands. There's scummy water standing around tussocks 
covered with long grass, most of it dead. There's a lot of choking 
underbrush.

All of this fades away into a grim, obscuring fog.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

				JUD
		Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.

				LOUIS
		Is there quicksand?

				JUD
		Ayuh.

				LOUIS (nervous; joking)
		Are there ghosts?

JUD looks at him expressionlessly.

				JUD
		Ayuh.

JUD starts off, stepping to the first tussock. After a moment, 
LOUIS follows.

EXT.  JUD, CU

His face is set, strange.

				JUD
		There's a lot of funny things down
		this way, Louis.

EXT.  LOUIS, BEHIND JUD

				LOUIS
		You're telling me.

EXT.  JUD

				JUD (still walking)
		The air's heavier...more electrical...
		something. You might see St. Elmo's
		Fire...what the sailors call 'foo-lights.'
		It makes funny shapes, but it's nothing.

EXT.  LOUIS

HE looks up and his eyes widen as he sees:

EXT.  ANGLE ON LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV

A faintly glowing, ethereal shape hangs in the branches of one of 
the dead trees. It looks a bit like a corpse. In fact, I think it 
looks quite a bit like PASCOW'S corpse.

As we watch it fades...fades...is gone.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's somewhere between being mystified and puzzled and being 
scared. Now a weakly glowing fireball rolls slowly across the 
surface of the standing water toward him...and then just fades 
into the thick mist.

				LOUIS
		It's funny, all right.

EXT.  JUD

				JUD
		Just don't stop, Louis. You don't
		ever want to stop down here in
		Little God. (Pause) And you don't
		ever want to look behind you,
		whatever you hear.

EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS, LONG ANGLE  NIGHT

We see them moving through the mist like wraiths, JUD with his 
digging tools, LOUIS with his light and his Hefty-Bag coffin. The 
whole swamp is glowing dimly.

EXT.  THE FAR SIDE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP  NIGHT

In the extreme f.g. we can see firm ground sloping up. Ahead is a 
thick white mist. And here comes JUD and LOUIS slogging through it 
and out of it. Both of them are wet from the knees down. They head 
into the woods on the far side.

EXT.  A LOW, STONY BLUFF OR STEEP HILL

In the book this is described as being almost a cliff, but a rocky 
hill rising out of the woods would serve just as well. We can see 
steps cut into the side, and two figures--LOUIS and JUD--toiling 
up them.

EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT

JUD'S panting and out of breath; LOUIS is, if anything, in worse 
shape.

				JUD
		Almost there, Louis.

				LOUIS
		You keep saying that.

				JUD
		This time I mean it.

He tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars, 
the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow. A few moments 
later LOUIS joins him and stares with undisguised wonder.

EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS AND JUD'S POV

The top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare, but there are a 
number of rocky piles. But for every pile of rocks we can see, 
there are ten littered heaps, as if the neat piles had been burst 
apart. There's a shape to all of this, and it is the shape of the 
Pet Sematary: concentric circles.

SOUND: The wind, blowing ceaselessly.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF THE BURYING GROUND

				LOUIS (awed)
		What is this place?

				JUD
		This was their burying ground, Louis.

				LOUIS
		Whose burying ground?

				JUD
		The Micmac Indians. I brought you here
		to bury Ellen's cat.

				LOUIS
		Why? For God's sake, why?

				JUD
		I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later.
		All right?

				LOUIS
		I guess so...but...

				JUD
		You want to rest a bit before you start?

				LOUIS
		No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to
		dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.

				JUD
		Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.

He hands him the pick and shovel.

				JUD
		I'm going to sit over yonder and have a
		smoke. I'd help you, but you've got to
		do it yourself. Each buries his own.
		That's how it was done then.

JUD walks away, leaving LOUIS with the digging tools in one hand 
and the flashlight in the other. After a minute, LOUIS walks out 
into the burying ground.

EXT.  LOOKING DOWN INTO A SHALLOW HOLE  NIGHT

SOUND: The wind. It blows ceaselessly up here.

The hole's about two and a half feet deep. Stubby rocks protrude 
from the sides. The pick comes down, hits a rock at the bottom, 
and flashes fire.

EXT.  LOUIS

He drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits. Beside 
him we see a low pile of rocks and earth.

				JUD (voice)
		Should be deep enough.

He joins LOUIS. He's got a lot of rocks in his arms.

				LOUIS
		You think so?

He notices the rocks.

				LOUIS
		What are those for?

				JUD
		Your cairn.

EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS'S POV

Those tumbled piles of rock are very obvious.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, BY CHURCH'S GRAVE

				LOUIS
		Doesn't look like they last long.

				JUD
		Don't worry about that.

				LOUIS
		Jud, why am I doing all this?

				JUD
		Because it's right.

He walks off again.

LOUIS looks after him for a moment, then kneels down.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY THE GARBAGE BAG

He opens it and looks in at CHURCH'S stiffening corpse.

				LOUIS
		Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You
		were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if
		you were worth all this aggravation,
		but you were a hell of a good cat.

He tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave, and then 
begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade.

EXT.  THE CAIRN, CU  NIGHT

LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and add a final two or three 
stones.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY THE CAIRN

He looks at it for a moment and stands up. JUD is right there.

				JUD
		That's fine. You did real good.

LOUIS looks at him.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT

There's a light on in the kitchen, but that's all. There's silence 
at first, and then the PHONE STARTS RINGING.

EXT.  LOUIS'S FIELD  NIGHT

LOUIS and JUD are coming down the path with their tools and their 
lights. They are both clearly fagged out.

SOUND, FAINT: The telephone.

				LOUIS
		Oh, shit! Rachel!

He drops the tools and sprints.

EXT.  THE CREED'S SIDE YARD, BY THE TIRE SWING

LOUIS runs into the side yard. SOUND of the phone is louder.

EXT.  THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS

He runs to the door and inside.

EXT.  THE END OF THE PATH, WITH JUD

He stands there, eyes inscrutable.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE

It stops. A beat later LOUIS enters the room. He picks it up, 
although he already knows it's too late. He listens to the SOUND 
of the dial tone and then drops it back into the cradle, 
disgusted.

He starts to dial a number from memory.

				JUD (voice)
		Louis.

INT.  THE KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH JUD

				JUD
		When you talk to 'em, not one word
		about what we done tonight. 'S'far's
		you know, the cat's still fine.

INT.  LOUIS, BY THE PHONE

After a moment he lowers it into the cradle.

INT.  JUD

				JUD
		You'll understand. In the meantime,
		keep your peace. What we did, Louis,
		was a secret thing. Women are supposed
		to be the ones who are good at
		keeping secrets, but any woman who
		knows anything at all would tell you
		she's never seen into a man's heart.
		The soil of a man's heart is stonier,
		Louis--like the soil up there in the
		old Micmac burying ground. A man
		grows what he can...and tends it.

During this, he's come across the room to LOUIS and dropped his 
hand on LOUIS'S shoulder.

				LOUIS
		But--

				JUD
		No buts! Accept what's done, Louis.
		What we done was right. Another time
		it might not be, but tonight it was...
		at least I hope to Christ it was. Now
		you make your call...but not a word
		about tonight.

EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH JUD

SOUNDS: Boops and beeps of a touch-tone telephone. Ringing. Then:

				DORY GOLDMAN (voice)
		Goldman residence.

				LOUIS
		Hi, Dory...it's Louis--

During this, another SOUND has been growing: an approaching truck. 
As JUD gains his side of the road, he looks back, and we read fear 
on his face--no matter what he said to LOUIS, he's sorry for 
tonight's piece of work.

A moment later a highballing Orinco truck cuts between THE CAMERA 
and JUD.

INT.  LOUIS, IN THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

He's on the phone, smiling and happy.

				RACHEL (voice)
		You want to talk to the birthday girl?

				LOUIS
		That'd be real fine.

				ELLIE (voice)
		Hi...daddy?

				LOUIS (sings)
		Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday
		to you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy
		birthday to you!

				ELLIE (voice)
		That was awful, daddy.

				LOUIS
		Yeah, I know...how are things out 
		there in Chicagoland?

				ELLIE
		Fine...except when Mom was airing
		Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and
		got into Grampa's study and pooped in
		Grampa's favorite chair.

				LOUIS (grinning broadly)
		Way to go, Gage!

				ELLIE (voice)
		What?

				LOUIS
		I said that's too bad. What did you
		get for presents from Gramma and Grampa?

				ELLIE (voice)
		Lots of stuff! I got two dresses...and
		a Chatty Cathy doll...

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE

She's dressed for bed, in fuzzy pink pajamas. Her Chatty Cathy is 
crooked in one arm. In her lap is a Garfield transistor radio.

				ELLIE
		...and a Garfield radio! How's Church,
		dad? Does he miss me?

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS

The smile fades off his face. It's replaced with a look of 
combined guilt and unhappiness. He's looking at his hands, which 
are still dark with the dirt from CHURCH'S grave.

				LOUIS
		Well...I guess he's just fine, Ellie.
		I haven't seen him this evening, but--

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE

RACHEL, holding GAGE, sits on the arm of ELLIE'S chair.

				ELLIE
		Well, make sure you put him down
		cellar before you go to bed so he
		can't run out in the road and get
		greased. And kiss him goodnight for me.

				LOUIS (voice)
		Yuck! Kiss your own cat!

				ELLIE
		Want to talk to Gage?

Before he can answer, she puts the phone in GAGE'S hand. ELLIE and 
RACHEL watch, amused, as GAGE gobbles into it. Perhaps RACHEL 
encourages him to say a few words.

INT.  THE CREED LVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS

From the telephone comes the sound of GAGE talking and chortling. 
LOUIS is not listening. His eyes--and his mind--are far away.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING

LOUIS is raking leaves on the side lawn, near the tree with the 
tire swing. After a moment or two of this he props the rake 
against the tree and starts toward the garage. He goes in.

EXT.  THE GARAGE, WITH LOUIS

It's dim in here. LOUIS is crossing to the door which communicates 
to the kitchen. As he passes the station wagon, he hears a cat 
HISS. He turns.

INT.  CHURCH, ECU

He's on top of the car, but at this point we probably don't 
notice; THE CAMERA is so close that CHURCH looks like he's coming 
right down our throats. He's hissing angrily.

INT.  LOUIS

He recoils and stumbles backward with a cry. He hits a tool-rack 
on the wall and a lot of them fall down with a LOUD JANGLING 
NOISE.

INT.  ON TOP OF THE STATION WAGON, WITH CHURCH

He jumps down, frightened by the noise, and the CAMERA TRACKS as 
he goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight.

INT.  LOUIS

He gets slowly to his feet again. He's getting over his fright but 
we can see he's totally freaked out by what gave him that fright. 
He goes to the garage door and looks out.

				LOUIS (calls)
		Church?

EXT.  THE SIDE YARD, LOUIS'S POV

Grass and fallen leaves. No sign of CHURCH.

EXT.  LOUIS'S STUNNED FACE, CU

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS

He's spooning cat-food into a dish. He goes to the door--there 
should be a total of three doors in the kitchen: one to the living 
room, one to the shed/garage, and one which leads directly 
outside. LOUIS uses this latter door now.

EXT.  THE KITCHEN STOOP, WITH LOUIS

He puts the dish of food down and sits beside it.

				LOUIS
		Food, Church...food!

SOUND: Miaow.

EXT.  THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, LOUIS'S POV

CHURCH comes slinking out of the bushes and comes slowly toward 
THE CAMERA. He stops, looking mistrustful.

EXT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS
		Come on, Church! Chow down!

EXT.  CHURCH

He crosses to the stoop and begins eating the food.

				LOUIS (to himself)
		Christ. I don't believe this.

He picks CHURCH up. CHURCH miaows again--he wants the food.

				LOUIS (wincing)
		God, you stink, Church.

CHURCH is looking at the food, trying to get out of LOUIS'S arms.

				LOUIS
		In a second.

He tilts the cat's head back so he can get a look at CHURCH'S 
neck.

EXT.  CHURCH'S NECK, CU (LOUIS'S POV)

There's some sort of mark here--a clear remnant	of the crash. A 
line of white fur, or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all 
grows.

EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, ON THE STOOP

LOUIS sees something else as he lets the cat's neck go. He tweezes 
something out of CHURCH'S whiskers.

EXT.  LOUIS'S HAND, ECU

It's a shred of green plastic.

EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH

				LOUIS
		Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded
		Christ, he ch--

CHURCH suddenly claws at his face.

				LOUIS
		Ow!

He claps his hand to his face. CHURCH leaps for the food. LOUIS 
slowly takes his hand away. There are claw marks on his cheek, 
welling blood. He looks at the cat.

EXT.  JUD CRANDALL'S GARDEN, WITH JUD

The garden is a plot of about half an acre. JUD comes trundling 
slowly along a row, pushing a wheelbarrow. There are several 
pumpkins in it. JUD is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a 
Ramones sweatshirt. He's wearing his headphones and we can hear 
the Romantics doing "What I Like About You." JUD is singing along 
and bopping a little--as much as his arthritis will allow, if you 
can dig it.

He sees a real big pumpkin, stops, and bends over to get it.

He takes out his pocket-knife and slits the pumpkin-vine. He gets 
the pumpkin in his arms and stands up. He turns...and LOUIS is 
right there (kind of a cheap jump, but always fun), looking 
totally stunned.

JUD, startled, drops the pumpkin. LOUIS reaches out and slides the 
phones off JUD'S ears.

				LOUIS
		What did we do?

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN

LOUIS is sitting at the kitchen table. JUD is at the fridge. JUD 
comes back with a couple of long-necked bottles of beer and opens 
them.

				JUD
		I most generally don't start before
		noon, but this looks like an exception.

				LOUIS
		What did we do, Jud?

				JUD
		Why, saved a little girl from being
		unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!

LOUIS drinks about half the beer.

				LOUIS
		I tried to tell myself I buried him
		alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets
		Felix the Cat. But...

				JUD
		Wouldn't wash?

				LOUIS
		No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I
		see it, and Church was dead. He smells
		horrible and he uses his claws, but
		he's alive...and I feel like I'm going
		crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?

				JUD
		Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about
		the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids
		just called him Stanny B. He was half
		Micmac himself.

LOUIS drains his beer.

				LOUIS
		Can I have another one?

				JUD
		I guess it wouldn't hurt.

He gets up and goes to the fridge.

INT.  JUD, AT THE FRIDGE

				JUD
		The Micmacs used to bury their dead
		up there long before the whites came.

He returns to the table with the beer.

				JUD
		They buried their dead and for a long
		time their dead stayed buried. Then
		something happened. Half the tribe died
		in a season. The rest moved on. They
		said a Wendigo had soured the ground.

				LOUIS
		Wendigo?

				JUD
		Spirit of the north country. Not a good
		spirit. Wendigos are great liars and
		tricksters, according to the stories. 
		And if one touches you...

JUD pauses, perhaps a flustered, and gathers his thoughts.

				JUD
		Maybe it really was a Wendigo--
		I ain't the one to say it wasn't--
		or maybe it was just some disease.
		Whatever the reason, those that were
		left moved on. But they left that
		place...the way it is now.

JUD shrugs, and drinks.

EXT.  JUD AS A BOY, CU/SEPIA TONE  DAY

The time here is about 1910. JUD is wearing short pants. He's 
crying, not in any big-deal histrionic way, but as if he means to 
keep doing it for a long time. I mean he looks really sad.

				JUD (voice)
		I loved my dog a lot, Louis. When Spot
		died, I thought I was gonna die.

JUD is sitting on the front stoop. It's the same house JUD lives 
in now, but the porch hasn't been added yet, and the road is dirt 
rather than tar.

Along this road comes a horse-drawn wagon--STANNY B.'S wagon. The 
wagon's full of junk, rags, bottles...stuff to sell and swap. 
Strung across the top are bells, and we can hear their CHIMING 
SOUND...but faint, like bells heard in a dream.

STANNY B. is old and drunk. Dust spumes up behind the wagon as he 
draws up to the CRANDALL house and stops. He gets down, almost 
falls, takes a bottle out of his back pocket, drinks, and 
approaches JUD. We can see him speaking.

INT.  JUD'S KITCHEN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS

				LOUIS
		You and this old Indian rag-man--

				JUD
		Stanny B. did for me what I did for
		you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't
		alone when Spot came back.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL BACK YARD/SEPIA TONE  DAY

JUD'S MOTHER is back to THE CAMERA, hanging sheets on the line. 
The sheets billow. And suddenly, pushing out from behind them, 
quite near her, is a small mongrel dog. SPOT. He's covered with 
graveyard dirt. His eyes are red and rolling. He splashes the 
sheets with the muck of his passage.

				JUD (voice)
		My mother was with me.

She sees who it is--what it is--and backs away, screaming, 
horrified.

EXT.  SPOT, CLOSER/SEPIA

				JUD (voice)
		He'd got caught in bobwire that infected.
		You could still see the marks on him.

And so we can, around his neck and along the side of his head. 
These marks are the counterpart of the marks we've already seen on 
CHURCH.

SOUND of JUD'S MOM SCREAMING. Like the bells, these are screams 
heard in a dream.

EXT.  THE BACK STOOP OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE/SEPIA

The BOY JUD comes running out, dressed in a night-shirt.

EXT.  JUD'S MOM/SEPIA (JUD'S POV)

She's cringing against the fence at the rear of the yard. SPOT 
stands in front of her, swaying from side to side, as if doped.

				JUD'S MOM (dim; far)
		Get your dog, Jud! He stinks of the
		ground you buried him in! Come here
		and get your dog!

She is in utter terror.

EXT.  THE BOY JUD/SEPIA

Horrified...ashamed.

EXT.  JUD'S MOM/SEPIA

				JUD'S MOM (terror)
		COME AND GET YOUR DOG!!

INT.  JUD AND LOUIS, IN JUD'S KITCHEN

				LOUIS
		How did your mother take it, Jud?
		How did she take it when your dog
		came back from the dead?

JUD'S face is a complication. He's lying to LOUIS, certainly--but 
is he also lying to himself? Yes, I think so.

				JUD
		Well, she was a little upset at first,
		and that's why I thought you ought to
		hold your peace when you talked to
		your people last night...you did, didn't
		you, Louis?

				LOUIS
		Yes.

				JUD
		Why, then, things should be fine.

				LOUIS
		A little upset is all she was? Because
		I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a
		little like a nuclear reactor on the
		edge of a meltdown.

				JUD
		She got used to the idea. Spot lived
		another four years. He died peacefully
		in the night that second time, and I
		buried him in the Pet Sematary...where
		his bones still lie.

EXT.  THE ROAD BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES, WITH LOUIS AND JUD

We see them crossing.

				LOUIS (voice)
		You still haven't told me why you
		did it.

EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS, ON THE CREED FRONT LAWN

				JUD
		A man doesn't always know why he does
		things, Louis. I think I did it because
		your daughter ain't ready for her
		favorite pet to die.

				LOUIS
		What?

				JUD
		Ellie's a little scared of death. And
		the main reason Ellie's that way is
		because your wife is a lot scared of
		death. Now you just go ahead and tell
		me I'm wrong.

But LOUIS'S reaction tells him he's not wrong--in fact, JUD has 
hit the nail right on the head.

INT.  BATHTUB FIXTURES, CU

LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and turn the spigots.

INT.  THE BATHROOM, WITH LOUIS

He starts to undress, still looking troubled. We should notice 
that the door behind him is firmly shut. The bathroom has no 
windows.

INT.  THE BATHTUB SPIGOTS

The hot water is steaming. LOUIS'S hands enter the frame and turn 
off the faucets. SOUND of LOUIS climbing in.

INT.  LOUIS IN THE TUB

A big sigh and an expression of exquisite pleasure. He relaxes in 
the hot water. After a few moments he puts a wet washcloth over 
his face.

INT.  BY THE KITCHEN SINK, WITH RACHEL

				RACHEL
		Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give
		the little girl her promise.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE

GAGE is in his high chair. ELLIE is at her place, crying. In 
RACHEL'S place sits VICTOR PASCOW, bloody and wrecked. LOUIS sits 
in his place. On the platter of bacon and scrambled eggs is 
CHURCH'S mangled body.

				PASCOW
		The door must not be opened. The
		barrier must not be crossed.

				LOUIS
		You don't understand--

INT.  THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS

The washrag is slipping, but it still covers his face.

				LOUIS (mutters)
		--I'm a doctor.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE

In attendance: PASCOW, LOUIS, ELLIE, GAGE in his high chair. Lying 
in the middle of the table, clotted with dirt and blood, eyes 
staring, neck a gory mess of infected wounds, is SPOT. He's also 
dotted with clots of scrambled egg and bits of bacon.

				PASCOW
		Sometimes the dead do more than speak.
		Remember, doc.

INT.  RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN SINK

				RACHEL (with great force)
		Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Promise me.
		Promise me. Promise me.

INT.  THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS

The washcloth has slipped enough so we can see his eyes are 
closed--he's dozing.

				LOUIS
		Promise...

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE

To LOUIS, ELLIE, PASCOW, GAGE, and the corpse of SPOT enters JUD, 
his eyes shocked and staring.

				JUD (to LOUIS)
		You do it for all the best reasons,
		but that ain't why. You do it because
		it gets hold of you...you do it
		because you have to.

INT.  LOUIS, IN THE BATHTUB, CU

The washrag has worked its way down to his mouth by now. His doze 
is deepening; he's started to snore a little.

SOUND: A splash. Something has been dropped into the bath.

LOUIS opens his eyes. Looks puzzled. Looks down. Eyes widen in 
shock.

INT.  THE BATHWATER, LOUIS'S POV

A very large and very mangled dead rat floats in the bath, 
actually brushing against LOUIS'S chest. Blood has begun to stain 
the water.

INT.  LOUIS

Turns his head, preparatory to leaping out.

INT.  THE TOILET LID, WITH CHURCH

Its mouth yawns open. It hisses, showing bloodstained teeth.

INT.  THE BATHROOM

LOUIS leaps from the tub. Grabs a towel and begins to rub himself 
frantically. He's grossed out. The cat tries to arch against him 
and he hits it. CHURCH falls to the floor, hissing.

LOUIS looks at the closed door.

				LOUIS
		How the hell did you get in?

He may not know that, but he knows how it's going to get out. He 
opens the door to the upstairs hall. If CHURCH doesn't go at once, 
LOUIS helps it with his foot.

Then he looks down at:

INT.  THE BATHTUB WITH BRER RAT, LOUIS'S POV

INT.  LOUIS

Staring at the rat. Over this: THE SOUND OF JET ENGINES.

EXT.  A DELTA 727

Its landing gear unfolds preparatory to touching down at Bangor 
International Airport.

INT.  A DEPLANING AREA  DAY

Lots of people making their way up the jetway.

INT.  LOUIS, OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT

He's looking anxiously for his people. In one hand he's got half a 
dozen roses. His face lights up.

INT.  THE DEPLANING AREA, LOUIS'S POV

Here comes LOUIS'S family. ELLIE is a little ahead. RACHEL is 
pushing GAGE in his stroller. ELLIE sees LOUIS and lights up.

				ELLIE
		Daddy!

She runs for him.

INT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT

ELLIE comes belting up to LOUIS, weaving among the deplanees like 
a slalom skier. She leaps into his arms. LOUIS swings her 
cheerfully.

				LOUIS
		Hi, sugar!

She smacks him noisily. He smacks her back just as noisily.

				ELLIE
		Daddy, is Church all right?

LOUIS'S face changes. All at once he's watchful.

				LOUIS
		Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping
		on the front porch when I left.

				ELLIE
		Cause I had a bad dream about him.
		I dreamed he got hit by a car and
		you and Mr. Crandall buried him in
		the Pet Sematary.

				LOUIS (trying to smile)
		That was a silly dream, wasn't it?

				ELLIE
		Is he really all right?

				LOUIS
		Yes.

				ELLIE
		Because you promised.

				LOUIS
		I know.

RACHEL reaches them. She's pretty tired. Hair hanging in her face, 
good travelling clothes now looking a bit wrinkled and a bit 
stale.

				RACHEL
		Want to take your son, doc?

LOUIS does. GAGE is ecstatic.

LOUIS kisses RACHEL deeply.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, NIGHT

CHURCH at the door, waiting to be let out. ELLIE does the honors. 
CHURCH oils out into the shed/garage. ELLIE closes the door. She 
looks distressed. She crosses the kitchen again.

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

RACHEL, in a flannel nightgown, is watching TV. LOUIS is reading a 
medical tome and making notes. GAGE, zipped into a warm blanket 
suit, is sacking on the couch.

				ELLIE (entering)
		Can cats have shampoos?

				RACHEL
		Yes--you have to take them to someone
		who grooms animals, though. I think
		it's pretty expensive.

				ELLIE (still upset)
		I don't care. I'll save up my allowance
		and pay for it. Church smells bad.

				LOUIS
		I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up
		the money, Ellen.

				ELLIE
		I hate that smell.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

He looks both grim and sad--a man discovering that what you pay 
for you own, and what you own always comes home to you.

				LOUIS
		Yes--I hate it, too.

BLACK. And on it, a fourth title card: MISSY DANDRIDGE.

SOUND: A pen scratching over paper.

INT.  A STUDY DESK, CU

A single sheet of lined paper is spotlighted by the glow of the 
desk-lamp. On it, MISSY'S right hand is just finishing: "Dr. says 
Intestinal Cancer. Cannot face this Pain. Sorry."

The hand puts the pen down. It tears the paper in two, leaving 
just the half with the message.

INT.  THE DANDRIDGE CELLAR, NIGHT

A light comes on and we see a hangman's noose strung over a beam. 
It dangles above a kitchen table which has been relegated to 
cellar duty.

SOUND: Descending footsteps.

INT.  THE NOOSE, CU

SOUND of MISSY climbing onto the table.

Her face enters the frame. She looks very sick. She puts her head 
into the noose and rakes it tight at the hyoid bone.

EXT.  THE DANDRIDGE HOUSE, NIGHT

One light on...a cellar light.

SOUND: Ree-ree-ree...then...

SOUND: Kick! THUMP!

SOUND: Ree-ree-ree...

INT.  THE CELLAR, WITH MISSY DANDRIDGE

She hangs limply, hands dangling at her sides, above the table, 
which now lies upon its side. We can see the note clearly. She 
pinned it to the bodice of her housedress.

SOUND: Car engines starting up.

EXT.  IN FRONT OF THE GRACE METHODIST CHURCH  DAY

People are coming out and getting into their cars and turning on 
the headlights, even though it is only mid-morning.

In the immediate f.g. is a hearse. Four pallbearers are loading a 
coffin into it.

EXT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE, ON THE CHURCH STEPS

				ELLIE
		They're all turning on their lights!
		Daddy, why are they all turning on
		their lights in the middle of the day?

JUD, dressed in a rusty old black suit and a black tie, comes out 
and stands with them. He looks haggard and old.

				JUD
		They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.

				ELLIE
		Is that right, dad?

				LOUIS
		Yes. To honor the dead.

EXT.  THE CHURCH PARKING AREA

More cars start up; more lights come on; the back doors of the 
hearse swing closed.

EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETARY  DAY

[NOTE: In the book LOUIS finds it difficult to enter at night 
because of a high iron fence. Here we should see there's no such 
problem; there's only a low stone wall between the graveyard and 
the public road.]

The mourners are of course gathered around the grave of MISSY 
DANDRIDGE. The coffin rests above it on runners.

				MINISTER (voice)
		May the Lord bless you and keep you;
		may the Lord make his face to shine
		upon you, and comfort you, and lift
		you up, and give you peace. Amen.

EXT.  LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD

As the mourners begin to break up, these three start back toward 
LOUIS'S car.

				JUD
		Rachel not feeling well?

				LOUIS
		Well...a touch of the flu...

				ELLIE
		She's in bed. She was throwing up.
		Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said
		Missy--

				LOUIS
		That's enough, Ellen.

They've reached the CREED station wagon.

				JUD
		Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.

				LOUIS
		This babe has said enough.

He opens the front passenger door.

				LOUIS
		Hop in, Ellie.

She does, and LOUIS closes the door.

				JUD
		Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to
		hear. I remember when she was
		no older'n Ellen there, walking down
		to the store with her Raggedy Anne
		doll draggin' behind her in the dust.
		I don't know why God takes someone
		like her, who should have a bunch of
		years still in front of them, and lets
		an old shit like me just go on and on.

				LOUIS
		My father used to have a saying, Jud--
		"God sees the truth, but waits."

				JUD
		Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?

				LOUIS
		It's Ellie's cat.

				JUD
		Nope. He's your cat now.

JUD opens one of the back doors as LOUIS goes around to the 
driver's side.

INT.  THE BACK SEAT OF THE WAGON

JUD has tilted over in one corner and is snoring. His Walkman 
'phones are on and we can hear the tinny sounds of Billy Idol. A 
little old man's drool trickles down from one corner of his mouth.

SOUND: ELLEN< crying.

INT.  THE FRONT OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS AND ELLIE

Tears are spilling freely down ELLIE'S face.

				LOUIS
		Ellie? What's wrong?

				ELLIE
		No more chocolate chip cookies.

				LOUIS
		Huh?

				ELLIE
		Missy made the best chocolate chip
		cookies in the world--even Mom said
		so. Now there won't be any more
		because she's gonna be dead forever!

She cries harder. LOUIS reaches out and strokes her hair.

EXT.  THE STATION WAGON, DAY

Moving up the country road toward home through blazing fall 
foliage.

INT.  TV SCREEN, CU  NIGHT

On it is a scene from "Night of the Living Dead."

				NEWSCASTER
		Bizarre as it may seem, it now seems
		almost beyond doubt: the dead are
		returning to eat the living.

				ELLIE (voice)
		Daddy?

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

There's a VCR on top of the TV; LOUIS has been watching "Night." 
Now he quickly uses the remote control to shut down the TV.

She's dressed for bed, and comes toward him slowly.

				LOUIS
		What's up, sugar?

				ELLIE
		Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge
		went to heaven?

				LOUIS

		What?

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL

She's putting away the last of the supper things. She hears this 
and moves toward the living room door to listen. She doesn't look 
at all well. Her eyes are red from crying and her face is haggard.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS AND ELLIE

She's gotten up into his lap.

				ELLIE
		At school Michael McDowell said she was
		gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says
		all sewersides fry in hell.

				LOUIS
		Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full
		of shit he probably squeaks when he walks,
		my dear.

INT.  RACHEL, AT THE DOOR

She smiles a little at this.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE, IN THE LIVING ROOM

				LOUIS
		But don't you dare say that.

				ELLIE
		I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you
		think?

				LOUIS
		I don't know, honey. Different people
		believe all sorts of different things
		happen to us when we die. Some believe
		in heaven or hell. Some think we're
		born again as little children--

				ELLIE
		Sure, carnation. Like in that movie
		you rented, Audrey Rose.

				LOUIS
		Well, it's actually reincarnation, but
		you get the idea. And some people think
		we just wink out...like a candle flame
		when the wind blows hard.

				ELLIE
		Do you believe that?

LOUIS looks toward:

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM SOFA, WITH CHURCH, LOUIS'S POV

CHURCH is sleeping.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

				LOUIS
		I think we go on. I'm not sure
		what happens after we die, but yeah--
		I have faith in that.

				ELLIE
		You believe in it.

				LOUIS
		Oh, faith's a little more than just
		believing.

INT.  RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN DOOR

Listening intently.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

				LOUIS (continues)
		I'll tell you what faith is--it's the
		evidence of the heart; the assurance
		of things not seen.

				ELLIE
		I don't get it.

				LOUIS
		Well, here we are, sitting in my
		chair. Do you think my chair will
		be here tomorrow?

				ELLIE
		Yeah, sure.

				LOUIS
		Then you have faith in that. But
		we don't know it will be; after all,
		some crazed chair-burglar might break
		in while we're away and steal it, right?

ELLIE'S giggling.

INT.  RACHEL, AT THE DOOR

She's smiling, too...but tears are running down her cheeks.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

				LOUIS
		But we plan on that chair. We believe
		in that chair. And I plan on going on
		somehow as Louis Creed, after I die.
		I believe I will.

				ELLIE (awed)
		You have faith in that.

				LOUIS
		Yes ma'am. Just like I have faith that
		it is now time for Ellen Creed to get
		ready for bed. So buzz.

He gets her off his lap.

				ELLIE
		I'm not tired!

				LOUIS
		I'm sure you're not.

				ELLIE
		Then why do I have to go to bed?

				LOUIS
		Because your mother and I need
		the rest, sugar. Now buzz.

She heads toward the stairs.

INT.  LOUIS AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM

LOUIS is in bed, reading. RACHEL, wearing a robe over her 
nightgown, comes in.

				RACHEL
		I heard you tonight.

				LOUIS
		I thought maybe you did. I know
		you don't approve of the subject
		being raised--

				RACHEL
		That's not true. The subject
		scares me. Because of Zelda.

LOUIS puts his book down and looks at her thoughtfully.

				LOUIS
		Your sister, I know.

RACHEL sits down on the end of the bed. She's clasping her hands 
nervously together.

				RACHEL
		Sometimes you're so good with her,
		Louis--so straight with her--that
		you make me ashamed of myself.

LOUIS sits up and scoots down the bed to her. He tries to put an 
arm around her. She rejects it--but gently.

				RACHEL
		I'm sorry I couldn't go with you
		to Missy's funeral. And that I
		blew up when we went to that
		silly animal graveyard.

				LOUIS
		That's forgotten.

				RACHEL
		Not by me, it isn't. I know how
		badly I acted, how unfair I was.
		It's just that I..you know.

				LOUIS
		Yes, I guess I do.

He makes a place for her beside him and hugs her. They lie 
silently together for awhile, taking comfort from each other.

				RACHEL
		I'm going to try to do better.

				LOUIS
		You're doing fine.

							DISSOLVE TO:

BLACK. And on it, a fifth title card: GAGE.

SOUND: An idling truck motor.

EXT.  THE GRILLE OF A TRUCK  DAY

It looks monstrous...as high as a mountain.

EXT.  THE TRUCK, A NEW ANGLE

It's an Orinco tanker. The driver, a young man in khaki fatigues 
and a baseball cap, climbs up into the cab. He slams the door and 
jams the truck into gear.

				IRWIN GOLDMAN (voice)
		I knew something like this would happen.

EXT.  THE ORINCO SHIPPING YARD  DAY

The truck comes rolling slowly toward the main gate...stops so the 
driver can look both ways...and then pulls slowly out onto ROUTE 
9.

				IRWIN (voice continues)
		I told her when you were first married.
		'You'll have all the grief you can stand,
		and more,' I said.

INT.  A FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH IRWIN GOLDMAN AND LOUIS  DAY

There are others here, but they are in the b.g., and concentrating 
on the scene the old man is making. He's RACHEL'S dad. LOUIS is 
sitting in the aisle seat of a pew-like bench. He looks terribly 
shattered--they both do, actually. He's staring at the old man as 
if he cannot in the least comprehend what he's saying.

				IRWIN (continues)
		And now look at this!

He gestures toward:

INT.  THE FRONT OF THE FUNERAL CHAPEL  DAY

Here, half-buried in floral tributes, is a child-sized coffin. 
GAGE'S.

INT.  IRWIN AND LOUIS  DAY

				IRWIN (weeping)
		Run over in the road like a...a
		chipmunk!

EXT.  ROUTE 9, W/TRUCK  DAY

Getting up to speed.

EXT.  A KITE, CU

There's a hand holding it--LOUIS'S. The kite begins to move and 
THE CAMERA TRACKS IT. It flaps and flutters.

EXT.  THE FIELD BESIDE THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS

He runs with the kite beneath a gorgeous fall sky in which fat 
clouds move like airy ocean liners.

				ELLIE (voice)
		Go, daddy!

EXT.  A PICNIC TABLE  DAY

The remains of a picnic lunch are spread here. Looks like everyone 
ate well. In attendance: RACHEL, ELLIE, GAGE, and JUD CRANDALL.

				GAGE
		Go, dayee!

They all laugh--JUD ruffles the kid's hair.

EXT.  LOUIS, RUNNING WITH THE KITE

He's paying out string--and the kite is going up.

				LOUIS (voice)
		Where's Rachel?

INT.  THE FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH LOUIS AND IRWIN

IRWIN looks toward:

INT.  THE BACK OF THE CHAPEL, WITH RACHEL AND DORY GOLDMAN

They are by the sign-in book. Both are dressed in black. Both look 
haggard. But RACHEL looks more than haggard; she looks damned near 
insane with grief and horror.

INT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN

				IRWIN (leaning forward)
		With her mother! Where she should be!
		As for you, I hope you rot in hell!
		In hell, do you hear me?

We should; by now he's screaming his head off.

INT.  THE CAB OF THE ORINCO TRUCK  DAY

The driver is whistling. A transistor radio hangs from the rear-
view mirror on a strap. He turns it on. The Ramones. "Sheena." 
Hey-ho, let's go.

EXT.  ROUTE 9, TRUCKER'S POV

Unrolling before us at a good clip--too good, maybe.

INT.  THE TUCKER'S FOOT

Stamping the pedal closer to the metal.

EXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK

Belting toward THE CAMERA. SOUND of the GROWLING ENGINE.

EXT.  THE SKY, WITH THE KITE

LOUIS has clearly gotten it up okay.

EXT.  LOUIS, IN THE FIELD

He's holding the string, looking up at the sky. Now he looks back 
at the picnic table.

				LOUIS
		Hey, Gage!

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE

GAGE gets down and runs toward his father.

EXT.  ROUTE 9 WITH THE ORINCO TANKER

Belting along fast. SOUND of the Ramones.

EXT.  THE FIELD, WITH LOUIS AND GAGE

GAGE runs to his dad, chubby legs working. He reaches him, and 
LOUIS transfers thee ball of string to GAGE'S hands.

				GAGE
		Dat?

				LOUIS
		String! You're flying it,
		Gage--you got the hammer, my man!

				GAGE
		Gage fline it?

				LOUIS
		Bet your boots. Look--

LOUIS puts his hands over GAGE'S hands and pulls them down.

EXT.  THE KITE

It dips in the sky.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE

				LOUIS
		See?

				GAGE
		Gage fline it!!

				LOUIS (tenderly)
		Bet your ass, little hero.

He kisses his son. They look up at:

EXT.  THE KITE

Dipping and drifting in that gorgeous fall sky.

				IRWIN GOLDMAN (voice)
		Where were you while he was playing in
		the road? Thinking about your stupid
		medical articles? You stinking shit!
		You killer of children!

INT.  THE FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH LOUIS AND IRWIN

				IRWIN
		You--

But there is no way he can express his outrage with mere words. As 
LOUIS sits staring numbly up at him, IRWIN punches him in the 
nose. LOUIS sprawls backward, falling out of the pew onto the 
floor.

INT.  THE REAR OF THE CHAPEL, FEATURING RACHEL AND DORY

RACHEL screams and starts forward. DORY pulls her back.

				RACHEL
		Louis! Daddy! Stop it! STOP IT!

INT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN

LOUIS is getting up groggily. Hs nose is pouring blood.

				IRWIN
		How do you like that, you son
		of a bitch? I should have done
		it sooner!

IRWIN punches him in the stomach. LOUIS "oofs" and doubles over.

INT.  ANGLE ON THE OTHER MOURNERS

Among them we see STEVE MASTERTON and MARCY CHARLTON.

				STEVE (getting up)
		Hey!

INT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN

LOUIS is slowly straightening up. IRWIN is in a sour frenzy of 
glee.

				IRWIN
		How do you like that? How do--

LOUIS pushes the old man with both hands.

INT.  IRWIN GOLDMAN

He goes stumbling and flailing backwards...strikes the coffin... 
knocks it off its bier. A SCREAM goes up from the mourners.

INT.  RACHEL AND DORY

RACHEL screams. Her mother struggles to hold her but RACHEL easily 
breaks free and goes running down the aisle.

INT.  ANGLE ON MOURNERS, WITH MARCY AND STEVE

				MARCY
		Stop them. Right now.

STEVE gets up and goes toward:

INT.  THE FRONT OF THE CHAPEL, WITH IRWIN

He's picking himself out of a tangled mess of coffin and 
overturned floral tributes. His suit is wet from spilled water. 
He's weeping.

LOUIS has just reached him, and that stunned look is gone. I think 
he intends to do the Cool Jerk all over IRWIN GOLDMAN'S puny 
little body. IRWIN strikes a Gentleman Jim Corbett pugilistic 
pose.

				IRWIN
		Come on! I'm ready for ya! I'll
		take y'apart!

As LOUIS wades in, STEVE MASTERTON gets between them...at the last 
possible moment.

				STEVE
		Stop it!

LOUIS swings. STEVE manages to block the punch with his body.

				STEVE
		Stop it! Jesus, what's wrong with
		you, Louis? It's your son's funeral,
		not a boxing match!

That gets to LOUIS. He drops his fists. That stunned expression 
creeps over his face again--that look that says he doesn't have 
the slightest clue as to what's going on or how it could possibly 
have happened.

INT.  LOUIS

				PASCOW (voice)
		The soil of a man's heart is stonier,
		doc--

LOUIS turns toward:

INT.  THE FRONT PEW, WITH PASCOW AND CHURCH

PASCOW, bloody and ruined in his jogging shorts and muscle shirt, 
has the pew to himself...except for CHURCH, who is sitting on his 
lap and PURRING.

				PASCOW
		A man grows what he can...and tends it.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

A sense of horrible awareness comes into his face...and then he 
covers it with his hands and begins to SOB.

SOUND, COMING UP: A TRUCK MOTOR.

INT.  THE CAB OF THE TANKER

The trucker is singing along with the radio.

INT.  THE GAS PEDAL

It's closer to the floorboards than ever.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE WITH THE KITE, IN THE FIELD

We are at some distance--far enough to see that the two of them 
have moved quite close to the road.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE, A NEW ANGLE (KITE'S POV)

We can see their faces upturned to us--we can hear the AMPLIFIED 
RATTLING SOUND of the kite itself.

THE CAMERA PANS TO THE LEFT--to the road. And we can see the 
truck, fairly close by now, and coming closer.

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE, WITH RACHEL, ELLIE, AND JUD

JUD'S lighting a cigarette. His Walkman 'phones are around his 
neck.

				ELLIE
		I want to fly it! Can I fly it now,
		mommy!

				RACHEL
		In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his
		turn.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE

This is the last moment of happiness in this man's life--so let's 
make it very happy. As he and GAGE stare up at the kite:

				IRWIN (voice)
		Jesus. Louis. I'm sorry--

INT.  THE FUNERAL CHAPEL

The fight has gone out of IRWIN and STEVE has backed away--but 
cautiously. He's ready to jump back in if one or the other goes 
mad again. But IRWIN is shuffling toward LOUIS, hands out--
everyone else has gathered in a knot near the front of the chapel. 
Among them is RACHEL and her mother, weeping in each others' arms.

				IRWIN
		I don't know what happened to me.
		Louis, please--

LOUIS brushes by him with no acknowledgement that IRWIN even 
exists. He kneels down slowly by the coffin and puts his head 
against it.

				LOUIS (weeping)
		I'm sorry, Gage--I'm so sorry,
		little hero.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE, IN THE FIELD

There's a strong gust of wind. The ball of string falls out of 
GAGE'S hand.

EXT.  THE KITE, BLOWING AWAY

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE

				ELLIE
		It got away from him! That numb shit!

				RACHEL (outraged)
		Ellen Creed!

EXT.  THE BALL OF KITE TWINE

It is bouncing and unraveling. More importantly, it is being 
carried directly toward the highway.

EXT.  GAGE

He takes off after the ball of twine.

				GAGE
		Kite fline too fast!

SOUND: The oncoming truck.

EXT.  THE TRUCK

Slamming toward us--a brutal leviathan on eighteen wheels.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's looking--looking toward his people at the picnic table.

				LOUIS (shrugs, good-humored)
		What can you d-

TRUCK SOUND CONTINUES.

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE

TRUCK SOUND LOUDER.

Alarm hits JUD'S face. He rises.

				JUD
		Don't let him go in the road, Louis!

RACHEL looks; registers terrible alarm.

				RACHEL (screams)
		Get him, Louis!

EXT.  GAGE

He's still scampering after the bouncing ball of kite-twine, which 
has now almost reached the road.

TRUCK SOUND LOUDER.

EXT.  LOUIS

The SOUND is loud enough so he's having trouble hearing.

				LOUIS (cups his ear)
		What?

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE

				RACHEL (shrieks)
		GET THE BABY!!

JUD is running toward the road, although he'll never get to GAGE 
in time; only LOUIS has a chance.

EXT.  LOUIS

Horrible understanding dawns on his face. He whips around and 
sees:

EXT.  GAGE, LOUIS'S POV

The kid's almost in the road; the ball of twine is in it.

RISING DRONE OF THE TRUCK.

EXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK

EXT.  GAGE, RUNNING INTO THE ROAD

				GAGE (cheerful)
		Geddit-geddit-geddit!

EXT.  EVERYONE, KITE'S POV

GAGE reaches the middle of the road as the truck comes around the 
corner. LOUIS is running across the field, getting close to the 
side of the road. RACHEL is clutching ELLIE by the picnic table. 
JUD is helplessly trying to wave the truck down as it passes him.

EXT.  GAGE, IN THE ROAD

As he reaches the broken white line he grabs the ball of string.

SOUND OF THE ONCOMING TRUCK.

GAGE turns his head.

				GAGE (not afraid)
		Druck!

EXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK AND THE DRIVER, GAGE'S POV

Suddenly THE DRIVER'S face turns into a Halloween mask of horror. 
He BLASTS THE AIR-HORN.

EXT.  LOUIS, ON THE VERGE OF THE ROAD

				LOUIS (shrieks)
		NO!!

EXT.  GAGE

BLARE OF THE AIR-HORN. A shadow falls over his face. There is an 
audible CLICK! and we FREEZE FRAME. What we have now is a tremen-
dously winning photograph of a little boy, not quite two, with a 
ball of string in his hand...and a shadow lying across his face.

EXT.  PHOTO MONTAGE

a.) LOUIS is pushing RACHEL out of a hospital door. RACHEL is in a 
wheelchair and looks radiantly happy (so, for that matter, does 
LOUIS). I think we may safely assume that the small blanketed 
bundle in RACHEL'S arms is GAGE.

b.) LOUIS, bare to the waist, is tubbing a two-month-old GAGE in a 
baby-tub. He's laughing. The infant looks confused but calm.

c.) The whole family by the Christmas tree, following an orgy of 
present-opening. ELLIE, about five, has a doll in each hand. LOUIS 
and RACHEL are in pajamas. GAGE, about five months, is lying in a 
drift of wrapping paper. He looks confused but calm.

d.) A child's sneaker lying in the road. It's splashed with blood.

e.) GAGE--he's about nine months old in this snap--is propped up 
in the angle of a sofa. There's a big white rabbit in his lap. 
GAGE looks c. but c.

f.) ELLIE and GAGE, bundled up against the Chicago winter. ELLIE 
is pulling a child's chair-sled. GAGE is propped up in the chair. 
He's about eleven months old in this snap. He's laughing.

g.) The Orinco tanker, overturned on the far side of Route 9.

h.) This one was taken at Gage's first birthday party. He's 
wearing a party-hat and looking at a birthday cake with a single 
candle on it while LOUIS kisses one cheek and RACHEL kisses the 
other.

i.) LOUIS, in the road. He's holding GAGE'S jumper, which is torn, 
blood-soaked, and inside out. LOUIS is looking up toward the sky 
and screaming.

j.) Here is a full-face studio portrait of GAGE. He is smiling at 
us, heartbreakingly lovely. CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS while:

				JUD (voice)
		Sedative finally took hold. She's asleep.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH LOUIS

He's holding the studio portrait in his hands and looking at it 
fixedly. The other photos (the good ones, that is; not the 
screamers--those, we may assume, exist only in LOUIS'S tortured 
memory) are scattered on the table. We only saw a few; there are 
actually hundreds.

LOUIS puts the photo down as JUD comes in and crosses to the 
fridge. LOUIS'S nose is badly swelled. He also has a black eye.

JUD gets a couple of beers and comes back toward the table.

				JUD
		Your father-in-law packs a wallop,
		for an old guy. He and his wife gone
		back to Chicago?

				LOUIS
		No...squatting out there at the
		Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures.
		He really thinks Rachel's going to go
		back with them. Her and Ellie.

				JUD
		Louis--

The swing door opens. They look toward:

INT.  ELLIE

She looks dazed and shocked. There are brown circles under her 
eyes, but otherwise her complexion is much too white. She's 
wearing fuzzy pj's. She's carrying the picture of her pulling GAGE 
on the sled.

INT.  JUD AND LOUIS, AT THE TABLE

				ELLIE (coming to the table)
		I want to go back to my own room.
		I can't sleep with mommy. She
		keeps stealing the covers.

				JUD
		What you got there, Ellie?

At first she doesn't want to show him, but JUD is very kind.

				JUD (studying it)
		Why that's real nice...you pullin'
		him on a sled. Bet he liked that,
		didn't he?

ELLIE nods. She is starting to cry. JUD is also leaking at the 
eyes.

				ELLIE (crying)
		I used to pull 'im a lot.

LOUIS, looking down at his hands, nods.

				ELLIE
		I'm going to carry this picture,
		Mr. Crandall, until God lets Gage
		come back.

JUD reacts violently. And LOUIS looks up, dully curious...but 
hasn't the thought already passed through LOUIS'S mind? Yes--I 
think it has.

				JUD
		Ellie...God doesn't do things like
		that. I know you loved y'brother, but--

				ELLIE
		He can if He wants to. He can do
		anything, just like Inspector Gadget
		on TV. But I have to keep things ready
		for him, that's what I think. I've got
		his picture and I'm going to sit in
		his chair--

				LOUIS
		Ellie--

				ELLIE
		And I'm going to eat his breakfast
		cereal, too, even though it tastes
		like boogers. And...and...

She bursts into tears.

				JUD
		Louis, take care of your little
		girl...she needs you.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

His face is stricken.

INT.  ELLIE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

LOUIS comes in with ELLIE in his arms. He puts her gently into her 
bed and pulls the covers up. She's already mostly asleep.

				LOUIS (kisses her)
		Good night, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		G'night daddy.

He starts for the door.

INT.  ELLIE, CU

				ELLIE
		God could take it back if He wanted
		to, couldn't He? If He really, really
		wanted to? Can I have faith in that?

INT.  LOUIS, AT THE DOOR

He stands looking at her for a long time, apparently thinking 
about this quite deeply.

				LOUIS
		Yes--I suppose you can. Good night,
		Ellie.

He steps out, closing the door.

INT.  ELLIE, IN BED

In some sense comforted--it may be a poison comfort but she surely 
doesn't know this--she turns over on her side to go to sleep. We 
can see the picture of GAGE under her arm.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH LOUIS

The light here is fairly dim. LOUIS goes down and opens another 
door. He pokes his head in.

INT.  THE MASTER BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

He reacts first with surprise, then a species of horrified 
disgust.

INT.  LOUIS AND RACHEL'S BED, LOUIS'S POV

CHURCH is crouched on RACHEL'S sleeping form.

INT.  THE BED, A NEW ANGLE

LOUIS comes in and swats the cat a damned good one.

				LOUIS (low snarl)
		Fuck off, hairball!!

INT.  CHURCH, CU

It hisses at him through a mouthful of fangs, its eyes big green 
balls...and then it flees. CAMERA FOLLOWS IT out the door.

INT.  LOUIS, BY THE BED

RACHEL stirs and mutters thickly, then lies still again...she's 
doped to the gills. LOUIS bends over and kisses her gently.

He leaves the room and closes the door behind him.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH LOUIS

He tries the door a couple of times to make sure it's firmly on 
the latch (his face wears an expression of "How'd he get in there 
in the first place?"). Then he walks down the hall to the stairs.

INT.  ON THE STAIRS, CU

The cat is on one of the risers. LOUIS trips over it.

EXT.  ON THE STAIRS WITH LOUIS, WIDER

For a moment he's pinwheeling madly for balance, on the verge of 
falling. He regains his balance as the cat goes shooting across 
the dining room toward the kitchen.

LOUIS regains his equilibrium after a bit and continues on down.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS AND CHURCH

As LOUIS enters through the swing door from the dining room, JUD 
is just letting CHURCH out the back door. As JUD closes the door:

				LOUIS (slightly antagonistic)
		I thought you'd be gone by now.

				JUD
		I got you a fresh beer out of the
		fridge, Louis.

He indicates the table, where there is indeed a fresh beer.

				LOUIS
		Jud, I buried my son today and
		I'm very tired. I wonder if we
		could just--

				JUD
		You're thinking of things best
		not thought of, Louis.

				LOUIS
		I'm thinking about going to bed.

But he begins pouring the beer into a glass.

				JUD
		You never asked me if anyone had
		buried a person up there in the
		Micmac burying ground--

LOUIS'S hand jerks. Beer goes foaming across the kitchen table.

				JUD
		--but I think the thought
		has crossed your mind.

				LOUIS
		Shit! Look at this mess!

				JUD
		Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.

As LOUIS goes to get a cloth to wipe up the mess:

				JUD
		I know the Micmacs thought it was a
		holy place...and then they thought
		it was a cursed place. That's why
		they moved on.

				LOUIS
		Because something called a wendigo
		soured the ground.

				JUD
		And because the dead walked.

LOUIS stops sopping and looks at him.

INT.  JUD, CU

				JUD
		Oh, ayuh. It's been done. What you've
		been thinking of has been done.

EXT.  A COUNTRY RAILROAD STATION/SEPIA  DAY

The time is the late summer of 1944, although I don't believe we 
need to know that specifically. The sign on the station reads 
LUDLOW. There are a few 40s cars parked near the station--they 
have gas-ration coupons on the windshields. And a hearse.

A train is coming.

EXT.  THE HEARSE, WITH UNDERTAKER AND BILL BATERMAN/SEPIA

We can see the UNDERTAKER is trying to talk to BILL BATERMAN, a 
man in his forties who periodically wipes his brow with a bandana. 
BILL walks away. He doesn't want to talk; he doesn't want comfort. 
He's a grief-stricken, bitter man.

				JUD (voice over)
		Timmy Baterman was on his way home
		from the war with his Purple Heart
		when he got killed in some stupid
		car accident down in Georgia.

EXT.  THE TRAIN, IN FRONT OF THE DEPOT/SEPIA

The door of the mail-car is open. The UNDERTAKER and three 
trainmen are unloading TIMMY BATERMAN'S coffin, which is draped in 
a 48-star flag. BILL BATERMAN stands by, watching balefully as 
they carry his son's final apartment to the back of the hearse and 
load it in.

				JUD (v-o continues)
		Bill was bitter--his son had been in
		the thick of it two years and then got
		shot in the leg--a clean flesh-wound.
		He was supposed to be coming home safe
		and sound. Instead, he come home in a
		box after all.

EXT.  THE REAR OF THE HEARSE/SEPIA

The doors close. The hearse pulls away. THE CAMERA PANS TO BILL 
BATERMAN, who stands staring balefully after it and mopping his 
brow.

				JUD (v-o continues)
		He wasn't able to get to the bottom
		of the truth, Louis.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD  NIGHT

LOUIS is now sitting down, drinking a beer, staring at JUD.

				LOUIS
		I'll bite--what's the bottom of the
		truth, Jud?

				JUD
		Why...that sometimes dead is better.
		That's all. Sometimes dead is better.

				LOUIS (bitter)
		Tell that to my wife and little girl.

				JUD
		It ain't your wife and little girl
		that's got me worried, Louis.

EXT.  THE LUDLOW CEMETARY/SEPIA  DUSK

We're featuring a fresh grave...that of TIMMY BATERMAN. A truck, 
showing only parking lights, turns into the graveyard and drives 
slowly up to it. It stops, and BILL BATERMAN gets out. HE looks at 
the grave and then goes to the back of his truck.

				JUD (voice-over)
		Timmy was buried on July 22nd, as
		I remember.

EXT.  BILL BATERMAN AT THE BACK OF HIS TRUCK/SEPIA  DUSK

He reaches in...and brings out a pick and shovel.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  MARGIE WASHBURN, ON HER PORCH/SEPIA  DAY

She's a middle-aged woman dressed in mid-forties style. She's got 
a rug-beater in one hand; the other is up to her eyes to shade the 
sun. She's staring at something, horrified.

				JUD (v-o continues)
		It was four or five days later when...

EXT.  A COUNTRY DIRT ROAD, WITH TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA  DAY

A young man dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt is shambling up the 
road. His eyes are vacant. His shirt is half untucked. His hair is 
sticking up in a wild crow's-nest thatch. There is an ugly mess of 
healed scars on his neck and one side of his face. I think one of 
his ears may be gone--torn off in the accident.

				JUD (v-o continues)
		...Margie Washburn seen him walking
		up the road toward Yorkie's Livery.

EXT.  MARGIE/SEPIA

She's screaming--we hear her faintly.

EXT.  TIMMY/SEPIA

He turns toward her and we see a green light like the St. Elmo's 
fire in the Little God Swamp glow dimly deep in his eyes. He grins 
at MARGIE.

EXT.  IN FRONT OF THE LUDLOW TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA

She hesitates for a moment or two and then walks up toward the 
door.

				JUD (v.o.)
		Lots of people saw Timmy Baterman
		walking back and forth between the
		home place and the town line. But 
		it was Margie...

INT.  THE TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA

She's in a hallway in front of a door with LUDLOW SELECTMEN 
printed on the frosted glass. After a moment she opens it and goes 
in.

				JUD (v.o. continues)
		...who finally got up enough guts to
		talk to the town fathers about it.
		She knew it had to be stopped, Louis.

INT.  THE SELECTMEN'S OFFICE/SEPIA

MARGIE and four men are grouped around a desk. She's talking; 
they're listening. THE CAMERA LAZILY PANS the four men--one, of 
course, is JUD as a YOUNG MAN.

				JUD (v.o. continues)
		She knew it was an abomination.
		George Anderson, the town postmaster,
		was there...and Alan Purinton...Hannibal
		Benson...and me. I was there.

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE/SEPIA  SUNSET

It's a ramshackle old farm which looks remarkably like the estate 
of that gentleman farmer Jordy Verrill.

An old Ford pulls into the driveway, and the four men get out.

SOUND BLEEDS IN: Most of all the SOUND OF THE CRICKETS.

They go to the door, and JUD is wordlessly elected as the prime 
honcho. He knocks. No answer. Again. No answer.

SOUND: Crazy laughter.

				BILL BATERMAN (voice)
		Stop that, Timmy!

The four men look at each other.

				JUD
		Come on.

They start around to the back.

EXT.  THE BACK YARD, WITH BILL AND TIMMY/SEPIA

TIMMY BATERMAN is staring directly into the setting sun, his eyes 
glowing with green fire. He's laughing like Goofy gone insane. 
BILL, scared, is trying to make him stop, to turn away from the 
sun.

EXT.  THE BACK YARD, A NEW ANGLE/SEPIA

The four men come around the side of the house. They freeze when 
they see BILL and TIMMY.

				ALAN
		Oh holy Jesus lookit that.

BILL whirls around and sees them.

				BILL
		You men get out of here!

				JUD
		I heard your boy was killed down
		Georgia.

				BILL (agitated)
		That was a mistake!

				HANNIBAL
		Was it?

				BILL
		You see him standing there,
		don't you? Now get out! Get the
		Christ off my land!

Now TIMMY turns around and comes shambling forward.

				TIMMY (laughing)
		Ge ow! Ge Cwise off eye an!

				GEORGE (revolted)
		Oh Jesus, Jud! He's dead! I can
		smell him!

				BILL
		He ain't dead! Give him a day or two
		and he'll be fine! Don't you say that!

				JUD
		Bill, this ain't right--you can see
		that yourself--

				BILL (screaming)
		GET OUT! YOU HEAR? GET OUT!!!

EXT.  TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA

				TIMMY (laughing)
		Dead! We love dead! Hate living!

Abruptly he reaches up with both hands and scratches down his 
cheeks, goring deep grooves in his flesh. Blood flows sluggishly 
out. Very weird blood.

EXT.  THE ENTIRE GROUP/SEPIA

BILL grabs TIMMY, who's still laughing wildly, and gets him turned 
around. TIMMY shambles back to where he was originally standing. 
BILL goes with him like a man who has charge over a trained 
baboon. A stupid trained baboon.

				BILL (over his shoulder)
		You want to get out of here before I get
		my shotgun! You boys are trespassing!

EXT.  THE FOUR MEN/SEPIA

				JUD
		God help you, Bill.

EXT.  BILL AND TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA

				BILL (snarls)
		God never helped me. I helped
		myself.

EXT.  TIMMY BATERMAN, CU/SEPIA

Staring directly into the setting sun and laughing wildly, 
mindlessly.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD

				LOUIS
		What happened?

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE--MONTAGE  NIGHT

a.) A car pulls up with its lights off and stops.

				JUD (v.o.)
		There was a fire.

b.) We see legs as people get out of the car, and hands holding 
tin cans of gasoline.

c.) Hands splash gasoline from the cans along the sides of the 
house.

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PORCH  NIGHT

JUD (as a young man) rings the bell--an old-fashioned twist type.

				BILL (voice)
		Who's there?

				TIMMY (laughing, screeching voice)
		Ooo air? Ooo air?

				JUD
		Get out, Billy--the place is
		going up.

He walks away. BILL BATERMAN, wearing a strappy tee-shirt, looks 
out the window.

				BILL
		I seen you! I seen you, Jud Crandall!

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE--MONTAGE  NIGHT

a.) A match is struck...and applied to wet boards. Whoosh!

b.) The other side of the house: The same.

c.) In the back yard, JUD lights a torch and heaves it through the 
kitchen windows. Ka-PLOOM!

d.) The men draw away toward the front, their faces grim and 
judgmental.

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE  NIGHT

Burning. Going up fast.

EXT.  THE MEN

				ALAN
		You think Bill's gonna get out, Jud?

				JUD (stony)
		If he don't, he don't.

EXT.  THE FRONT DOOR

It bursts open. We see two men struggling at the forefront of an 
inferno--correction, one man and an undead monster. TIMMY is 
giggling and screaming, trying to pull his father back into the 
flames.

				BILL (struggling)
		No! No, Timmy! Let me go!

				TIMME (laughing)
		Love dead! Hate living!

He sinks his teeth into his father's arm. BILL screams.

A beam falls on TIMMY, lighting him afire. BILL breaks free and 
runs down the porch steps.

INT.  THE FRONT HALL, WITH TIMMY

He's burning and laughing.

				TIMMY
		LOVE DEAD! HATE LIVING!

And into the fire he goes, still shrieking and laughing.

EXT.  THE FRONT YARD  NIGHT

BILL BATERMAN is collapsed on the lawn as sparks drift down around 
him, his face hidden against his thighs, weeping.

CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the four men, who are grouped at the end 
of the driveway by the road and staring with awe at:

EXT.  THE BLAZING FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD

				JUD (softly)
		Sometimes dead is better, Louis.

BLACK. And on it, a sixth title card: THE DEAD WALK.

SOUND BLEEDS IN: JET ENGINES.

EXT.  BANGOR INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL  DAY

A jet plane rises into the sky from behind the building.

				GATE AGENT'S VOICE
		This is the final call for United's
		flight 61 to Chicago...

INT.  A BOARDING GATE, WITH LOUIS AND RACHEL

In the b.g. we can see IRWIN and DORY GOLDMAN waiting by the 
jetway with ELLIE as the last few passengers board. RACHEL looks 
confused and grief-stricken. She also looks punchy, doped up. I 
imagine she's floating on a sea of Valium, and that makes her 
easier to deal with. LOUIS'S battle-scars are fading a little.

The GATE AGENT is standing by the jetway with a mike in one hand 
and a bunch of boarding passes in the other.

				GATE AGENT (concludes)
		All passengers should now be aboard.

				LOUIS
		You better get going, hon.

				RACHEL
		Oh Louis, I just don't know about
		this--

				LOUIS
		I told you last night--this can be the
		start of patching things up with your
		folks. If something good doesn't come
		of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.

				RACHEL
		Louis, are you sure?

				LOUIS
		I'm sure.

INT.  THE GOLDMANS, WITH ELLIE

				ELLIE
		I don't want to go to Chicago,
		Gramma Dory.

				DORY
		Why not, darling?

				ELLIE
		I had a bad dream last night. A
		nightmare.

				IRWIN (kindly)
		About what?

				ELLIE
		About Daddy. (Pause) And Gage.

DORY and IRWIN exchange a knowing, sad glance over the child's 
head.

				ELLIE
		And someone named Paxcow.

INT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS

LOUIS guides her to the jetway.

				LOUIS
		Come on, you guys--before you miss
		the boat.

He kisses DORY. IRWIN hugs him.

				IRWIN
		Louis, I am sorry. What can I say?
		That I lost my mind? It's the truth,
		but no good excuse.

				LOUIS (hugs him back)
		We all lost our minds, Irwin.

LOUIS kisses RACHEL. Then he kneels and hugs ELLIE.

				LOUIS
		Be good to your mother, darlin'.
		She needs you.

				ELLIE
		Come with us, daddy. Please come
		with us!

				LOUIS
		I'll be there in three days--four
		at the most. I've got to get the
		electricity shut off and square
		things with your school so the
		truant officer ain't after you, and--

INT.  ELLIE, CU

				ELLIE (crying)
		Please, daddy! I'm scared!

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

				LOUIS
		Of what?

				ELLIE (crying harder)
		I don't know.

				LOUIS (great emphasis)
		Everything's going to be all right,
		Ellie. Now go on--get aboard.

				ELLIE
		Do you swear?

				LOUIS
		I swear.

The Voice of Authority has spoken. We can tell by ELLIE'S face 
that while things are still not all right, they are a little 
better. She joins her mother.

The four of them--RACHEL, ELLIE, and THE GOLDMANS--start down the 
jetway. ELLIE looks back once, as if begging him to come...and 
then they're gone.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

LOUIS'S face changes. Now it is a stony and contemplative face. 
Not, when you get right down to it, a very nice face.

He turns and strides away.

INT.  THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT, WITH LOUIS

The family station wagon is in the f.g. We hear the SOUND OF JET 
ENGINES, and as LOUIS reaches the wagon he turns and watches:

EXT.  THE TERMINAL,, LOUIS'S POV

From behind it a United Airlines jet lifts into view and banks 
away.

EXT.  LOUIS, IN THE PARKING LOT

Face set, he gets into the wagon and drives away.

EXT.  ROUTE 15 IN BREWER

The CREEDmobile pulls up across from the Brewer Tru-Value Hardware 
and LOUIS crosses to it.

INT.  THE HARDWARE STORE COUNTER, CU

On it: A six-cell flashlight, Duracell D-batteries, a pick, a 
shovel, and a nylon drop-sheet in cellophane packaging. Now the 
CLERK'S hands come into the frame and drop a pair of heavy work-
gloves into the pile.

INT.  LOUIS AND CLERK (SMALL PUN, HEE-HEE)

				CLERK
		Anything else for you today?

				LOUIS (after a look)
		I think we got it all.

The CLERK starts to ring things up.

				CLERK
		Looks like heavy work.

				LOUIS
		It could be.

The quality of LOUIS'S reply is somehow unnatural. The CLERK looks 
at him, momentarily unsure and uncertain. Then he starts ringing 
things up again.

INT.  A UNITED JETLINER, WITH ELLIE AND RACHEL

ELLIE is in the window-seat, asleep. RACHEL is holding a paperback 
but not reading it. Her eyes are red. She's looking into space.

CAMERA DRIFTS TO ELLIE. Her sleep is not easy. Her head turns from 
side to side, as if in negation. She becomes steadily more upset. 
She's starting to mutter. Suddenly her eyes flare open and she 
screams.

INT.  JETLINER, SLIGHTLY WIDER

We can see the GOLDMANS in the seats behind the CREEDS. They are 
startled. So are other passengers. A stewardess comes running.

				ELLIE
		Paxcow says it's almost too late!

				RACHEL
		Ellie...Ellie...what...

				ELLIE
		Paxcow says it's almost too late!
		We have to go back! Paxcow says it's
		almost too late!

EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETARY  DAY

The CREED wagon turns in and drives up one of the lanes. It stops 
and LOUIS gets out.

EXT.  LOUIS

He walks to a fresh grave on which the first flowers are already 
starting to wilt. He sits down and takes a flower. He plucks it, 
looking at the grave steadily. He says nothing for a long time.

				LOUIS
		It's wrong. (Pause) What happened
		to you is wrong.

EXT.  GAGE, IN THE FIELD

He runs toward THE CAMERA, happy and laughing, in SLOW MOTION.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

LOUIS is now weeping, but he seems calm just the same.

				PASCOW (voice)
		Remember, doc.

LOUIS looks at:

EXT.  A TOMB, LOUIS'S POV

PASCOW, bloody and mutilated, is standing by it.

				PASCOW
		The barrier was not meant to be
		crossed. The ground is sour.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

He is not put out of countenance in the slightest by PASCOW'S 
appearance; he probably knows PASCOW is just a figment of his 
conscience or imagination, and so do we.

				LOUIS
		I'll tell you where the ground
		is sour--the ground in my heart
		is sour. Let me tell you something
		else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.

EXT.  PASCOW

				PASCOW
		Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

				LOUIS
		Don't talk like an asshole even if
		you are just a bit of underdone
		potato or a blot of mustard.

EXT.  PASCOW, BY THE TOMB

He stands mute, just looking.

EXT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS (weeping)
		He was my son! He wasn't even two
		and he was run down in the fucking
		road and he was almost in pieces,
		and if you don't think I'm going
		to try...

EXT.  THE TOMB, SANS PASCOW

VIC has put on his boogie shoes.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

He's crying harder. Abruptly he reaches out at the floral tributes 
and knocks a bunch of them over.

				LOUIS
		If it doesn't work--if he comes
		back like Timmy Baterman--I'll
		put him to sleep. But I'm going
		to try. (Pause) And if it doesn't
		work...they don't ever need to know.

EXT.  THE GOLDMAN HOUSE IN LAKE FOREST, ILLINOIS  NIGHT

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL  NIGHT

THE CAMERA MOVES LEISURELY along this hallway, which is lined with 
pictures of RACHEL, ELLIE...and GAGE (there may even be a couple 
in which LOUIS is featured, but damned few). Near the end of the 
hall a door is open and light spills out.

				RACHEL (voice)
		Honey, you just had a bad dream. You
		know that, don't you?

				ELLIE (voice)
		It wasn't a dream. It was Paxcow.

THE CAMERA GOES THROUGH THE DOOR and into the room where ELLIE is 
staying. She's in bed, still badly upset. RACHEL is sitting on the 
bed beside her. There's a single lamp on the bedside table.

				ELLIE
		Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something
		really bad. He--

				RACHEL
		Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the
		boogeyman?

				ELLIE
		He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.

RACHEL turns off the bed-lamp.

				RACHEL
		There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you
		to go to sleep and forget all this
		nonsense.

				ELLIE
		Will you at least call and make sure
		daddy's okay?

				RACHEL
		Of course I will.

She kisses ELLIE.

				RACHEL
		Now will you try to go to sleep?

				ELLIE (turns over on her side)
		Yes, Mom.

RACHEL gets up and leaves the room.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

PASCOW is here, halfway down the hall to the stairs, bloody as 
ever. RACHEL doesn't see him. She looks perplexed, a woman trying 
to think of something. She stops very near him.

				RACHEL (to herself)
		Paxcow, why do I know that name?

				PASCOW
		Pascow.

RACHEL suddenly straightens. She looks startled and afraid.

				RACHEL
		Pascow? Was she saying Pascow?

She suddenly heads for the stairs, fast.

EXT.  THE CREED HOME IN LUDLOW  NIGHT

SOUND: A car starting up.

The station wagon backs out and heads down the driveway. As it 
passes THE CAMERA, we see LOUIS driving. The wagon turns onto 
Route 9 and heads off.

CAMERA HOLDS ON THE HOUSE. A beat of silence. Then: the telephone 
starts ringing.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

IRWIN and DORY are watching RACHEL with some anxiety. RACHEL is 
holding the phone to her ear. We can hear the FILTERED SOUND of 
one ring after another. She hangs up.

				RACHEL
		He's not home.

				DORY
		Why, he probably went out for
		a hamburger or a chicken dinner,
		dear. You know how men are when
		they're alone.

Good old IRWIN'S face says that maybe LOUIS went out for a couple 
of grams of coke and a whore in Nazi SS boots.

RACHEL is dialing another number.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL HOUSE  NIGHT

SOUND: Phone starts to ring.

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD

He shuffles to the telephone. His Walkman 'phones are around his 
neck. He's got a bottle of beer in one hand.

				JUD (picks up)
		Hello--you got Judson.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL

				RACHEL
		It's Rachel Creed, Jud. I'm
		calling from Chicago.

				JUD (surprised voice)
		Chicago! Is Louis with you?

				RACHEL
		No...we're going to be here
		awhile, and he wanted a few days
		to wind up our affairs there.
		I just wondered if he was with you.

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD

His face says this is very serious.

				JUD
		No--but if he drops by, I'll tell
		him to call you.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM

				RACHEL
		Jud, do you remember the name
		of the student that died on Louis's
		first day at work? The one that was
		hit by a car?

				JUD (voice)
		I don't--

				RACHEL
		Was it Pascow?

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD

				JUD
		Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis
		come home before I go to bed, I'll
		tell him to--

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL

				RACHEL
		Don't bother. I'm coming home.

				JUD (alarmed voice)
		Rachel!

				RACHEL
		Thank you, Jud. Goodbye.

She hangs up.

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD

				JUD
		No! Rachel! Don't do that!
		Rachel--!

The buzz of an open line. Connection broken. JUD slowly replaces 
the receiver. The man looks very grim.

INT.  THE FRONT HALL OF THE GOLDMAN HOUSE

RACHEL comes down the stairs, dressed for travelling. She's 
carrying a suitcase in one hand. Her parents meet her at the foot 
of the stairs.

				DORY
		Rachel...darling...you're upset...
		a night's sleep...

				RACHEL
		I have to go. The connections are 
		tight, and I have to be at O'Hare in 
		forty minutes. Will you drive me,
		daddy?

				IRWIN
		You know something's wrong, don't you?
		You know. And Ellie does, too.

				RACHEL
		Yes.

				IRWIN
		I'll drive you.

				ELLIE (voice)
		Mommy?

They all turn to:

INT.  ELLIE, ON THE STAIRS

				ELLIE
		Please hurry.

INT.  RACHEL AND THE GOLDMANS

				RACHEL
		I will. Come and kiss me.

ELLIE races into her arms.

EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETERY  NIGHT

SOUND Of a car engine, THROBBING AND LOW. It cuts off.

CAMERA MOVES IN on the low stone wall between the cemetery and the 
road. Beyond it we can see the roof of the CREED station wagon.

LOUIS appears, dressed in dark clothes. He looks both ways, then 
tosses a big duffle bag over the wall. Stuff clanks inside.

LOUIS climbs over the wall, grabs his bag, and checks out the 
scene.

EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETERY, LOUIS'S POV

A quiet city of the dead. Spooky. SOUND of crickets: Ree-ree-
ree...

EXT.  LOUIS

He heads for GAGE'S grave.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN CAR, WITH RACHEL AND IRWIN

				IRWIN
		I'll come with you if you want,
		honey.

				RACHEL (shakes her head)
		I've got three planes to catch and
		I got the last seats on two of them.
		It's like God saved them for me.

EXT.  O'HARE UNITED AIRLINES TERMINAL, WITH IRWIN'S CAR

IRWIN'S car heads for it.

EXT.  THE GRAVE OF GAGE CREED

LOUIS approaches it slowly and sets down his bag of grave-robbing 
equipment. He sets aside the remaining floral tributes and then 
opens the bag and takes out the spade. He looks down at the grave 
for a long second.

				LOUIS (low)
		Gonna bust you out, son.

He starts to shovel.

EXT.  THE SHOVEL, CU

Digging...throwing...digging again. Already the shape of the 
excavation is beginning to show. The work is easy; this earth is 
new and fresh.

EXT.  JETLINER, IN A LINE-UP OF JETLINERS

INT.  JETLINER, WITH RACHEL

Everyone looks impatient, but RACHEL looks half crazy.

				PILOT (voice)
		This is the Captain speaking.
		I'm sorry about this delay, folks,
		but we've got a real low ceiling
		tonight and air traffic control's
		playing it safe. Looks like it's
		going to be about half an hour before
		we get on a roll, so I'm turning off
		the NO SMOKING sign.

SOUND: Bing!

There's a general groan. CAMERA MOVES IN ON RACHEL, who has closed 
her eyes. I think she's praying.

EXT.  GAGE'S GRAVE  NIGHT

Now it's pretty deep. Four feet, maybe. LOUIS is standing in it. 
We see his feet as the shovel goes up and down, up and down.

EXT.  LOUIS  NIGHT

He's sweating and dirt-streaked. He's tossing dirt on a big pile. 
Suddenly, as he takes another shovelful, we hear a SCRAPING SOUND. 
He tosses the shovel aside and squats.

EXT.  IN THE GRAVE, WITH LOUIS

There's a white streak on the bottom of the grave--the top of 
GAGE'S coffin. LOUIS swipes his hand through the loose dirt, 
uncovering more, and then he begins to sweep off the top of the 
coffin with his hands.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL PORCH

JUD comes out. He's wearing a light jacket. His Walkman 'phones 
are around his neck. He's got a six-pack. He looks at:

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE, JUD'S POV

It's dark.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL PORCH, WITH JUD

He sits down.

				JUD
		You done it, you stupid old man...
		now you got to undo it.

He puts his earphones on. Cracks a beer. Lights a cigarette. 
Pushes the PLAY button on the deck. Faint SOUNDS of The Clash 
buzz-sawing "Rock The Casbah."

JUD begins to watch.

EXT.  LOUIS

He climbs out of the grave and opens his duffle bag. He starts to 
pull out the pick.

SOUND of an approaching car.

LOUIS freezes.

EXT.  THE ROAD OUTSIDE OF THE CEMETERY

A police car comes cruising slowly along. The spotlight on the 
driver's side comes on and runs along the graveyard's stone wall.

EXT.  LOUIS

Watching. Waiting. Hardly breathing.

EXT.  THE POLICE CAR

It reaches the end of the wall. Everything looks jake. The 
spotlight goes out and the police car speeds up.

EXT.  LOUIS

He relaxes perceptibly. He gets the pick and drops back into the 
grave.

EXT.  THE TOP OF THE COFFIN, CU

LOUIS inserts the tip of the pick in the flange of the coffin and 
levers it. CRACKING SOUND. Again. More CRACKING. Again. And the 
lock breaks. The coffin lid comes up a little, dirt gritting in 
the hinges.

EXT.  LOUIS, CU

Here's a man on the thinnest edge between sanity and madness.

EXT.  JETLINER LIFTING OFF FROM O'HARE

INT.  RACHEL AND HER SEATMATE

				SEATMATE
		Think you'll make your connection
		in Boston?

				RACHEL
		I have to.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

He's lying on his stomach, reaching in. We hear the SOUND of dirt 
grating in hinges again.

EXT.  LOUIS, CU

We're looking up into his face. If GAGE had a POV, this would be 
it. LOUIS'S face fills with a terrible grief.

				LOUIS
		Oh, Gage--oh, honey.

EXT.  JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH

His chin slips to his chest, even though we hear Creedence on his 
'phones and to him the sound must be at blastoff levels. There's a 
long round ash on his cigarette in the tray. A couple of empty 
beer cans on the table beside him.

A truck blasts by, startling him out of his doze. He jerks his 
head up suddenly...and slaps himself. He's okay...for now.

EXT.  THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS

He is sitting on the edge of the grave, holding his dead son in 
his arms, rocking him. GAGE is back to us. We see only a small 
limp figure in a dark suit. Hair flops limply.

				LOUIS
		It's going to be all right...I
		swear it's going to be all right...

The canvas tarp has been spread open to the right. LOUIS begins to 
lay his son down on it.

EXT.  THE GROUND BESIDE THE TARP, CU

It's littered with flower petals. One limp hand appears among 
them.

EXT.  LOUIS

He closes the tarp over GAGE, making a roll. He then produces rope 
from the duffle bag. He cuts the rope and begins to tie one piece 
around one end of the canvas roll containing the corpse of his 
son.

EXT.  JETLINER IN THE NIGHT SKY

				PILOT (voice)
		Good evening again, ladies and
		gentlemen...

INT.  THE JETLINER, WITH RACHEL

Her seatmate is knitting something. Across the aisle sits VICTOR 
PASCOW, bloody but serene, hands clasped in his lap, looking 
straight ahead. RACHEL looks around tensely.

				PILOT (continues)
		I'm delighted to tell you that we've
		got a strong tail-wind tonight and
		we expect to arrive at Boston's
		Logan Airport almost on time.

PASCOW clenches his fist in a "That's one for our side!" gesture.

				RACHEL (softly)
		Thank God.

Her SEATMATE looks at her a bit strangely.

EXT.  THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS

He's got the bundle containing his son and the duffle-bag with the 
tools. He runs bent over. He reaches the wall and there's the 
SOUND of another motor. He crouches at the base of the wall.

EXT.  THE ROAD

Here comes that same police car. The spotlight runs along the 
wall.

EXT.  LOUIS

Crouching against his side of the wall and sweating.

EXT.  THE POLICE CAR

It stops. The COP gets out. He walks slowly toward the wall.

EXT.  LOUIS

Crouched. Now we see the COP looking over the top. If he looks 
down...but he doesn't. Instead he turns around so we see his back. 
LOUIS looks up, miserably scared, pouring sweat.

Silence. Then: SOUND of the cop taking a whiz.

EXT.  THE COP

Ah! Relief. SOUND of his fly being zipped. He looks back at the 
cemetery for a moment.

				COP
		I ain't afraid of no ghost.

He walks back to his cruiser, gets in, and hauls ass.

EXT.  LOUIS, BEHIND THE WALL

He collapses with relief. Then he gets up and looks cautiously 
over the wall. Nothing there but his car, parked a little way down 
on the other side of the road.

He tosses the duffle bag over the top of the wall. He puts the 
canvas roll containing GAGE on top of the wall. Then he vaults 
over.

EXT.  THE STREET SIDE OF THE WALL, WITH LOUIS

He takes the roll, gets the duffle bag hooked over his shoulder by 
the string, and runs across the road like a soldier crossing enemy 
territory. He goes to the rear of the wagon.

EXT.  THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS

He puts the body down. He feels in his pocket for his keys. No 
keys. Mild consternation. He looks around, feeling exposed. The 
other pocket. Still no keys. More consternation. He begins to hunt 
feverishly through his pockets. Maybe in his jacket? Nope.

SOUND: An approaching car.

EXT.  PASSING CAR

A civilian--not the ubiquitous cop.

EXT.  LOUIS

He turns his pockets out, spilling change everywhere. Nothing. 
Suddenly a little light goes on in his eyes. He goes to the 
driver's side of the car and looks in at:

INT.  IGNITION, LOUIS'S POV

The keys are in the switch.

EXT.  LOUIS

He snatches the keys and returns to the back of the wagon. He uses 
the key to open the doorgate. He puts GAGE'S body in gently, then 
the duffle bag. He closes the doorgate and returns to the front of 
the car. He opens the driver's door and freezes.

LOUIS returns to the rear, gets his keys from the doorgate, comes 
back to the front, gets in, and drives away.

INT.  A JETWAY AT LOGAN INTERNATIONAL

People are debarking into the gate area. Through them comes 
RACHEL, running fast, pushing some people, excusing herself 
incoherently. PASCOW is walking near her.

				PASCOW
		There's just time. If you run.

Without looking at PASCOW, RACHEL takes off her shoes and runs.

INT.  THE CONCOURSE, WITH RACHEL

She's sprinting down the concourse--look out, Joanie Benoit!

INT.  GATE 27, WITH FEMALE GATE AGENT AND PASCOW

The FEMALE GATE AGENT is starting to close the jetway door.

				PASCOW
		Don't do that, babe.

The GATE AGENT looks puzzled, as if she just had a thought (or 
maybe a gas pain). She stops closing the door. RACHEL runs into 
the area. She sees:

INT./EXT.  THE JET PLANE, THROUGH THE GATE WINDOWS

It is just starting to swing ponderously away from the jetway.

INT.  RACHEL AND FEMALE GATE AGENT (PASCOW IS GONE)

				RACHEL
		Make it come back!

				FEMALE GATE AGENT
		I can't--

RACHEL bolts down the jetway. The GATE AGENT stares after her, and 
then runs for her stand, where we can see FLIGHT 61 and BANGOR on 
the slide-cards. She picks up her mike.

EXT.  THE JETWAY  NIGHT

RACHEL stands all alone at the end of it.

AMPLIFIED SOUNDS OF JET ENGINES.

				RACHEL (screams)
		COME BACK, MOTHERFUCKER!!

EXT.  THE JET, RACHEL'S POV

It starts to swing back to pick her up.

EXT.  RACHEL

PASCOW appears behind her and puts a hand on her shoulder.

				PASCOW
		You're doing just fine.

EXT.  JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH

He's fast asleep with the tinny sound of Graham Parker coming out 
of his Walkman 'phones.

SOUND: An approaching car.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE

The station wagon turns in and parks. LOUIS gets out. He opens the 
back, removes the body in the tarp and the duffle bag filled with 
tools. He manages to get everything together and walks to the edge 
of the path. He looks at:

EXT.  THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV

Off it goes, glimmering in the dark.

EXT.  LOUIS

He holds the corpse of his little boy to him.

				LOUIS
		Please God--let this work.

He sets off.

EXT.  JUD, ON HIS PORCH

Zonked out. He missed the whole thing. Nice going, Jud.

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE ARCH TO THE PET SEMATARY, WITH LOUIS

Louis passes under like a ghost.

EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY, WITH LOUIS

LOUIS is crying. He crosses to the deadfall.

				LOUIS
		Ain't gonna stop, Gage. Ain't
		gonna look down.

He begins to mount the deadfall.

EXT.  LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE

He reaches the top. And woven into the deadfall, behind him, 
facing the Pet Sematary, is that snarling face.

LOUIS descends the other side.

EXT.  THE FOOT OF THE DEDFALL, WOODS SIDE

LOUIS reaches the bottom and looks at:

EXT.  THE WOODS, LOUIS'S POV

The path winds onward through those gigantic trees--it glows 
slightly.

EXT.  LOUIS, MOVING UP THE PATH

EXT.  LOUIS, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP

That phosphorescent glow is a lot more pronounced. SOUNDS of 
CRICKETS and FROGS. The water is mucky and still. Hummocks stick 
up like knobs on the back of a creature best not seen. Fog drifts 
through the dead trees. LOUIS doesn't want to go in there. Smart 
man. I wouldn't either.

But he does.

INT.  THE HERTZ DESK, AT BIA WITH RACHEL AND CLERK--AND PASCOW

PASCOW is lounging back against the rack of folders--and getting 
some of them bloody.

				HERTZ CLERK
		I'm sorry...it's been very busy
		tonight. I really don't have
		anything.

				PASCOW
		What about the Aries K with the
		scratch on the side?

The CLERK starts looking through her papers.

				CLERK
		I do have an Aries K, but it came
		in sort of beat up--there's a long
		scrape up one side--

				RACHEL
		I'll take it.

EXT.  LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP

He comes walking toward THE CAMERA with GAGE in his arms and the 
duffle bag over his shoulder. Mist swirls around him. The 
landscape is weird, surreal. CRICKET SOUNDS, AMPLIFIED. In fact 
there are a lot of swampy, marshy SOUNDS--too many. It sounds 
almost prehistoric.

SOUND: HARSH, SCREAMING LAUGHTER

LOUIS stops. He looks slowly around at:

EXT.  MIST-FACE, LOUIS'S POV

A demonic face takes shape in the mist and FLOATS SLOWLY TOWARD 
THE CAMERA. It runs out a tongue that's about nine feet long.

Its eyes blow out. Blood and thick, gooey stuff runs from the 
sockets.

EXT.  LOUIS

He closes his eyes. After a moment he opens them.

EXT.  LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV

Nothing there.

EXT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS
		See? Just imagination. Just--

EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET

We can barely see them because they are thick in mist, but he is 
standing on a couple of low, marshy tussocks. Suddenly a thick 
tentacle slimes its way out of the standing water and slithers 
around his ankle.

EXT.  LOUIS, LOOKING DOWN

				LOUIS
		Nothing...there.

He turns around and begins to walk again.

EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET

The tentacle falls away.

EXT.  LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP

MYRIAD SOUNDS, none of them pleasant--laughter, gobbling howls, 
screams. Sounds like the swamp has been invaded by a pack of 
escaped lunatics. LOUIS continues on regardless.

EXT.  WOODS

LOUIS comes into the frame. He's obviously tiring now, but he 
keeps moving along.

SOUND: Approaching footsteps. Big ones. Thudding ones. Something 
is coming which sounds approximately the size of a Tyrannosaurus 
Rex. And it just keeps getting louder and louder and louder. LOUIS 
looks plenty scared.

SOUND: A falling tree.

EXT.  WOODS, LOUIS'S POV

Those SOUNDS keep getting closer and closer. Another tree falls--
we see this one. And now we see a SHAPE--just a SHAPE.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's scared almost to death. His face turns up...up...up.

EXT.  THE WOODS--AND THE SHAPE, LOUIS'S POV

It is vaguely manlike: perhaps sixty feet tall, perhaps eighty. We 
don't see it very well, nor do we have to--I'm not even sure it's 
flesh and blood. But there is a clear suggestion of a head. Now it 
turns and looks down...looks at LOUIS CREED. We see great yellow 
eyes the size of lighthouse lamps.

It makes a huge GRUNTING SOUND...and then walks on.

EXT.  LOUIS

The SOUND OF FOOTFALLS is slowly diminishing.

				LOUIS
		It was the Wendigo. Dear God, I
		think the Wendigo just passed
		within sixty feet of me.

Slowly he begins to walk again.

EXT.  LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE

In the extreme f.g. is a tree which has just fallen--it is no 
small tree, either, but a great big old fir.

LOUIS approaches it. Stops. Looks at the tree. Looks down at:

EXT.  THE FOREST FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV

Here is a gigantic animal track--if it was full of water, LOUIS 
could swim in it. It looks like no animal track we've ever seen 
before. Three big claws at the end of it.

EXT.  LOUIS

Looks up again. His face is set and hard.

				LOUIS
		It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage.

He starts to walk again.

EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND

SOUND: The wind, lonesome and keening.

THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY toward the slope, dreaming its way over 
those rocky cairns...most of them burst apart.

SOUND: Tortured breathing. Panting.

LOUIS toils his way into view, carrying his bundle. He reaches the 
top. He makes his way slowly into the burying ground. He stumbles 
over a rock. Falls down. Slowly gathers his things together and 
gets up again. He goes a little further and then stops and looks 
at:

EXT.  A BROKEN CAIRN AND THE GRAVE BENEATH, LOUIS'S POV

We can also see the shredded remains of a green garbage bag.

EXT.  LOUIS

He slowly kneels down. He puts the canvas tarp to one side and 
slowly takes the pick and shovel from the duffle bag. By now he is 
clearly a man approaching total exhaustion.

EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH AN ARIES K

It tracks past THE CAMERA.

INT.  THE ARIES K WITH RACHEL AND PASCOW

Both of them look tense. RACHEL is bolt upright behind the wheel. 
Suddenly, BANG! as one of the tires blow.

EXT.  THE ARIES K

It goes skidding and slueing across the road, the rear tire half 
off the rim. IT climbs the curb and hits a tree.

INT.  RACHEL

She lurches forward, but she's wearing her seat-belt--good girl! 
She unbuckles it and gets out.

EXT.  RACHEL

She looks at the car, which now has quite a bit more wrong with it 
than just a scratch up the side.

RACHEL slumps, near tears. LOUIS isn't the only one who's been 
through a lot tonight.

				RACHEL
		Now what?

PASCOW comes from around the tree as RACHEL walks to the road, 
looking for cars, or something. He looks urgent and upset.

				PASCOW
		It's trying to stop you. Do you
		hear me? It's trying to stop you.

RACHEL looks around uncertainly...a little afraid. As she scans 
the scene she looks at--and through--PASCOW.

				RACHEL
		Is anyone there?

After a moment of silence she turns back to the road. Lights 
appear and brighten as a car approaches. RACHEL steps to the 
shoulder and after a moment she sticks out her thumb, surely for 
the first time in her life.

The car sweeps by her without slowing.

EXT.  GAGE'S CAIRN, CU

LOUIS'S hands enter the shot and put a few more rocks on it. THE 
CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see him surveying his work. Beside him is 
the canvas tarp, now open and empty.

Absently, LOUIS stuffs the tarp into the duffle bag (where his 
tools have also been replaced) and stands up with a wince. One 
hand goes to his lower back. He looks down at the cairn.

				LOUIS
		Come back to me, Gage. Come back
		to us.

He turns away toward the stairs.

EXT.  RACHEL, ON ROUTE 9

She's walking down the shoulder with her high heels in one hand. 
Lights. An approaching car. She turns, thumb out. The car blasts 
by.

				RACHEL (shouts)
		MAY THE SEWERS OF RANGOON BACK UP
		IN YOUR BEDROOM, ASSHOLE!

She starts walking again.

EXT.  THE FIELD BESIDE LOUIS'S HOUSE

LOUIS is moving down the path. As he passes the tire swing he 
pushes it, setting it in motion.

INT.  THE GARAGE

LOUIS slings the duffle bag wearily to one side and goes into the 
kitchen. CHURCH is under the table but LOUIS Doesn't see him.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL

SOUND of LOUIS slowly plodding up the stairs. He comes into view, 
dirty and exhausted, his hair hanging in his face. He walks down 
the hall toward the master bedroom.

INT.  THE BEDROOM

The clock on the bedtable reads 2:17 A.M. LOUIS falls face-first 
on the immaculate bedspread and lies still.

In this shot we should note the closet door is standing open.

EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, FEATURING GAGE'S CAIRN

THE CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY. Holds. Nothing for a beat. Then:

A small white hand slams up through the rocks, hopefully scaring 
the living shit out of us.

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER as the hand begins to feel around. It takes 
one of the rocks and pushes it aside. Another. Another. Another.

The SOUNDS are not encouraging. It is GRUNTING and GROWLING. There 
is nothing human here.

Rocks begin to tumble as GAGE starts to come out of his grave.

INT.  THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

Fast asleep on the coverlet in his dirty jeans and black sweater.

EXT.  RACHEL

My babe is still takin' a hike. But here comes another vehicle.

EXT.  THE DEADFALL IN THE PET SEMATARY

THE CAMERA MOVES IN on that snarling face.

SOUNDS: GAGE coming. Dead dry breath. Low snarling noises.

Now we see small feet in dirty black shoes walking down the 
deadfall.

EXT.  RACHEL

Suddenly, as the lights appear, she does a Claudette Colbert, 
pulling her skirt up and exhibiting a very lovely leg.

Lights--it's an Orinco truck, naturally--spotlight her. The truck 
stops.

EXT.  RACHEL AND THE TRUCK

The driver leans over and opens the door.

				DRIVER
		Hop in, baby.

				RACHEL
		Thank you.

She does.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH CHURCH

He's under the kitchen table, green eyes gleaming. I think he 
loves dead, hates living.

SOUND: The doorlatch. CHURCH MIAOWS.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, A NEW (LOW) ANGLE

GAGE'S shoes grit slowly across the linoleum, leaving dirty 
tracks. CHURCH turns to watch GAGE'S passage, and then follows.

INT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

CAMERA HOLDS ON LOUIS as those gritting footsteps approach. Then 
we pan to the closet. On the floor is LOUIS'S little black bag. We 
hold on this as the footfalls near. A small white hand enters the 
frame and pulls the doctor-bag out of the closet. Now another hand 
enters the frame and opens the bag. The hands search around inside 
and bring out a scalpel.

They hold it up. The GAGE-THING makes a contented SOUND.

EXT.  THE ORINCO TRUCK, ON ROUTE 9  NIGHT

It sweeps past THE CAMERA

INT.  THE CAB, WITH RACHEL AND DRIVER

				RACHEL
		Can't you go any faster?

				TRUCKER
		Lady, I got nine points on my
		license right now.

				RACHEL
		I understand. It's just that--

She looks at him, pleading. The TRUCKER speeds up.

				RACHEL
		Thank you. If you only understood
		how important this is--

				TRUCKER
		That's all right, babe. Only if we
		get stopped, next time I'll be the
		one hitchin' and you can give me a
		ride.

EXT.  JUD, ON HIS PORCH

More deeply asleep than ever. Suddenly, from inside, comes the 
sound of Quiet Riot singing/screaming "Bang Your Head." It's the 
stereo, and boy, is it cranked.

JUD straightens up so suddenly he almost falls off his chair. His 
hands go first to his earphones--his first thought on waking is 
that it's coming from there--and then he hurries inside.

CAMERA PANS DOWN to small muddy tracks on the porch floor.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD

He hurries in, turns on the light, and rushes across to his stereo 
system, which is state-of-the-art digital--it looks like a flying 
saucer among the more traditional furnishings of the room. He 
shuts it off and looks around, frowning.

SOUND: Todd Rundgren, singing "Bang on the Drum All Day" at the 
top of his voice.

JUD'S head snaps toward the SOUND.

INT.  A SONY RADIO, CU

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as JUD hurries across the kitchen to the 
counter, where the radio is. He turns it off, looking around, more 
bewildered than ever.

				JUD (sharply)
		Who's here?

He walks toward the door which gives on the hall.

INT.  THE HALL, WITH JUD

It's dimly lit by light-spill from the living room and kitchen.

				JUD
		Come on, stop playing games!

SOUND: Molly Hatchet, "Flirtin' with Disaster," being played top 
end, from upstairs.

JUD hurries up. Let me suggest that there is a certain psychology 
at work here--for the moment he's more concerned about waking the 
neighborhood with all this high-decible rock and roll than with 
the prowler...and he would certainly know who--or what--that 
prowler was, if he had time to think.

INT.  JUD'S BEDROOM

He enters and turns on the light. We see a portable phonograph 
with the record, turning. JUD rushes over and turns it off.

He looks around, and we see by his face that he knows.

				JUD
		Gage? (Pause) Are you the one
		playing games?

He goes to the window and looks out at:

INT./EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE, WITH THE STATION WAGON, JUD'S POV

INT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH JUD

He turns slowly and walks toward the bed.

				JUD
		Gage? Come on out.

He reaches in his pocket and brings out a pocket-knife. He unfolds 
the blade.

				JUD
		I want to show you something.

SOUND: Miaow!

INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH CHURCH, JUD'S POV

INT.  JUD, BY THE BED

				JUD (to the cat)
		How did you--?!

INT.  JUD'S FEET

A small hand holding a scalpel shoots out from beneath the skirt 
of the coverlet and slashes JUD'S calf,

INT.  JUD

He screams with pain and staggers backward.

INT.  JUD'S FEET

The other hand shoots out. GAGE grabs one of JUD'S ankles and 
pulls.

INT.  JUD

With a startled yell, he falls.

INT.  JUD AND GAGE

This one's gotta be pretty rough. George will know what to do. We 
finally see GAGE, but it should be clear to us that it's not 
really GAGE at all. Some daemonic presence is riding inside the 
mouldering, disfigured shell of GAGE.

There is a struggle. JUD is repeatedly slashed with the scalpel. 
Perhaps he gets GAGE a time or two with the pocketknife.

GAGE screams and gibbers--nothing intelligible here; only sounds.

JUD expires.

GAGE sits on top of him...and then bites into his throat.

EXT.  ROUTE 9, BETWEEN THE CRANDALL AND CREED HOUSES

Headlights. RACHEL'S truck has arrived. It pulls up.

RACHEL opens the passenger door, which is on JUD'S side.

EXT.  ANGLE ON THE CAB

We can see PASCOW sitting in the passenger seat where RACHEL just 
was.

				RACHEL
		Thank you so much.

				TRUCKER
		I didn't get a ticket, so you're
		welcome, lady.
			(And, more seriously)
		Whatever your problems are, I hope
		they work out.

				PASCOW
		It's the end of the line for me,
		too--I'm not allowed any further.

				RACHEL (to the trucker)
		I'm sure things will be fine.

				PASCOW
		I'm not.

She closes the door and steps down.

The truck starts off with a HISS OF RELEASED AIRBRAKES. As it 
pulls past her, RACHEL starts across the road, when:

				GAGE (soft voice)
		Mummy!

She stops, startled. Her face wears a "did I hear that?" 
expression. She looks back toward JUD'S house.

				GAGE (soft voice)
		Mummy!

RACHEL walks halfway up JUD'S paved walk and looks at:

EXT.  JUD'S HOUSE, RACHEL'S POV

The one place in the whole world we do not want RACHEL to go.

EXT.  RACHEL

She goes. Up the steps to the porch. All through this she's been 
travelling with two bags: her handbag and a light tote with her 
initials on it. Now she sets the tote down on the top step and 
opens the porch door.

She looks very uncertain. This is the wee hours of the morning, 
and someone else's house. But...that voice...

				GAGE (voice)
		Mummy, I need you!

RACHEL looks stunned--rocked. She steps onto the porch.

				RACHEL
		Who--

The door to the house swings open. After a moment CHURCH comes 
into the doorway and sits down.

				CHURCH
		Miaow!

				RACHEL
		Church!

				GAGE (voice)
		Mummy, I need you!

She crosses to the open door.

				RACHEL
		Gage? Gage?

No answer. RACHEL steps in.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING

INT.  THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

He's restless, having a very bad dream, from the look. He rolls 
back and forth. Closer and closer to the edge. Finally, with a 
wild yell, he goes over onto the floor.

INT.  LOUIS, ON THE FLOOR

He comes awake. Sits up. Ouch! He's aches from top to bottom and 
side to side...but his back is worst. His hands go to it.

				LOUIS
		Jesus!

He starts to get up very slowly, and this his eyes fix on:

INT.  GAGE'S TRACKS ON THE BEDROOM FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV

They enter the house, go to the closet, then leave again.

INT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS
		Gage--?

He scrambles for the closet, his aches and pains forgotten. He 
stares in wildly.

INT.  THE DOCTOR-BAG

It's open.

INT.  LOUIS

He pulls the doctor-bag out. His original hope is now tempered 
with the first signs of fear. He begins to go through the doctor-
bag. Suddenly he brings out a case and opens it. The case is 
empty, but the indented shape is clear. There was a scalpel in 
this case...but not anymore.

				LOUIS
		Oh my God. (Pause) Gage!

INT.  THE HALL, WITH LOUIS

				LOUIS
		Gage!

LOUIS stands there, tensely listening, for a moment or two, but 
there's only silence. He rushes down the hallway and opens the 
door to GAGE'S room.

INT.  GAGE'S ROOM, LOUIS'S POV

Empty.

INT.  LOUIS, ON THE STAIRS

He goes downstairs, yelling GAGE'S name.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS

Nothing. The phone RINGS. LOUIS almost jumps out of his skin 
reaching for it.

				LOUIS
		Hello!

				IRWIN (voice)
		Hello, Louis--it's Irwin.
		I just wanted to be sure Rachel
		got back all right.

As IRWIN says this, LOUIS'S eyes fix upon something.

INT.  THE FLOOR, WITH TWO SETS OF GAGE-TRACKS, LOUIS'S POV

One set comes in from the shed-garage and heads for the parlor and 
upstairs. The other comes out of the parlor and crosses to the 
kitchen door giving directly on the outside.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS

In his eyes we suddenly see that he understands everything...or 
almost everything.

				IRWIN (voice)
		Louis...are you there?

				LOUIS (slowly)
		Yes--I'm here.

				IRWIN (voice)
		Did she get there all right?

				LOUIS
		Yes, she's fine.

				IRWIN (voice)
		Well, put her on at that end and
		I'll put Ellie on at this one.
		Ellie's very worried about her
		mother. (Pause) She's almost
		in hysterics.

				LOUIS
		She...Rachel's asleep.

				IRWIN (an edge in his voice now)
		Then I suggest you wake her up.
		Ellie...I think she had a dream that
		her mother was dead.

				LOUIS
		I'll call you right back.

				IRWIN (voice)
		Louis--!

But LOUIS, whose last few responses have been almost trancelike, 
hangs up. He looks at the tracks, then goes into the parlor.

INT.  THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE

Tiny bloody hands lift it off the cradle. A tiny bloody finger 
dials.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN

The phone starts to ring. After two or three ringy-dingys, LOUIS, 
looking extremely upset, comes out of the parlor and picks it up.

				LOUIS
		Irwin, you'll just have to--				

				GAGE (voice)
		I'm at Jud's, daddy. Will you come
		over and play with me?

LOUIS is dumbfounded...slack-mouthed with terror.

				LOUIS (a bare whisper)
		Gage?

				GAGE (voice)
		Mommy already came. We played, daddy.
		First I played with Jud and then mommy
		came and I played with mommy. We had
		an awful good time. Now I want to play
		with you.

GAGE begins to giggle...a really awful sound.

				LOUIS
		What did you do? What did you--

CLICK! The GAGE-THING hangs up, still giggling.

INT.  THE CREED BED, CU

He puts the doctor-bag down on the bed and roots through it. He 
comes up with three syringes, still wrapped in paper, and puts 
them aside. Then he roots around some more and comes up with 
several ampoules. He holds one up for inspection and we can read 
the word MORPHINE on it very clearly.

INT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

He carries the syringes and ampoules of morphine over to the 
window. His hair has gone partially white.

He fills all three syringes with morphine (using two ampoules for 
each syringe--i.e., enough to kill a polar bear) and puts them in 
the left breast pocket of his shirt. He puts the spare ampoules in 
the right breast pocket of his shirt.

LOUIS is slowly going insane. What remains of his rationality is 
like a rapidly fraying rope.

				LOUIS
		What you buy is what you own, and
		sooner or later what you own comes
		home to you. Wasn't that what you
		said, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much it?

He leaves the room.

EXT.  THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE

LOUIS comes out the door. In one hand he's got a raw pork chop. In 
the other he is carrying a pair of Playtex rubber gloves. He walks 
to the soft shoulder and waits for an Orinco truck to pass. Then 
he crosses.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL WALK, WITH LOUIS

He walks most of the way to the house, then stops.

EXT.  CHURCH, LOUIS"S POV

He gets up, humping his back warily.

EXT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS
		Hi, Church. Want some grub?

He tosses the pork chop onto the grass.

EXT.  CHURCH

He hurries down the steps, goes to the chop, sniffs it, and starts 
to chow up. He looks up at:

EXT.  LOUIS

He is pulling on the rubber gloves.

				LOUIS
		Don't mind me. Eat it while you can.
		Eat all you want.

EXT.  CHURCH

He starts worrying the chop again. Smack-smack-smack.

EXT.  ANGLE ON LOUIS AND CHURCH

				LOUIS
		Eat all you can...all you want...
		that's right...today's Thanksgiving
		day for cats, but only if they came
		back from the dead...

He finishes with the gloves, gets one of the loaded syringes out 
of his breast pocket, holds it up, squirts a drop out of the tip, 
then moves toward CHURCH.

CHURCH looks up. LOUIS stops moving. CHURCH starts eating again, 
and LOUIS starts moving again as soon as he does. All the time he 
talks to the cat in that soothing voice. He bends down...and grabs 
him.

CHURCH begins to squall and fight. LOUIS holds onto him. He tries 
to get the syringe into the cat and CHURCH almost gets away.

				LOUIS
		No, you don't!

EXT.  CHURCH, CU

The syringe plunges into his haunch.

EXT.  CHURCH AND LOUIS

The needle is still dangling out of CHURCH'S haunch. The cat looks 
dazed. It tries to walk and falls over on its side. It tries to 
get up...and then falls over again.

				LOUIS
		Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead.

He walks to the porch steps and picks up the tote-bag.

EXT.  THE TOTE-BAG, LOUIS'S POV

Any doubt he might have allowed himself the luxury of having is 
erased by the initials--R.C., same as the cola.

EXT.  LOUIS

Twang! One of the few remaining strands of sanity has now parted. 
He looks back at:

INT.  CHURCH, ON THE PATH, LOUIS'S POV

Dead.

EXT.  LOUIS

He climbs the steps and goes onto the porch.

EXT. LOUIS, ON THE PORCH

He strips off the rubber gloves. He tosses them onto the table 
beside JUD'S beer-cans as he goes inside.

INT.  THE FOYER OF THE CRANDALL HOME, WITH LOUIS

It's dark in here, and spooky.

				LOUIS
		Rachel? (Pause) Jud? (Longer pause)
		Gage?

No answer. He looks down and sees:

INT.  A SHOE, LOUIS'S POV

One of RACHEL'S shoes. It lies by the foot of the stairs.

INT.  LOUIS

He goes over and picks up the shoe. It's a three-quarter heel, and 
it's pretty badly scuffed. RACHEL, after all, did some pretty hard 
travelling to get here.

There's a spot of blood on it.

SOUND: A low giggle.

LOUIS looks up:

INT.  THE STAIRS, LOUIS'S POV

Mighty dark. Mighty shadowy.

SOUND: Another giggle.

INT.  LOUIS, AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS

				LOUIS
		Gage?

INT.  THE STAIRS

				GAGE (voice)
		Let's play, daddy! Let's play hide
		and go seek!

INT.  LOUIS

He takes one of the loaded syringes from his pocket.

				LOUIS
		All right, Gage...let's.

He begins to climb the stairs.

INT.  UPSTAIRS, WITH LOUIS

LOUIS arrives on the landing. We begin the nerve-wracking business 
of checking rooms. First, the bathroom...and the shower curtain is 
of course pulled. LOUIS yanks it back. Nothing.

He checks the linen closet. Nothing. Goes back to the hall. Looks 
down it. He walks slowly along it. He checks one room. It's a 
guest room. Shadowy and empty.

Down the hall. A closet door. A bag falls off the top shelf, and a 
bunch of ceramics inside it SHATTER LOUDLY. LOUIS flinches back.

Down the hall. Now he's at JUD'S room. He goes in.

INT.  JUD'S ROOM, WITH LOUIS

He checks the closet. No go. He steps around the bed and sees:

INT.  THE FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV

A bloodstain.

INT.  LOUIS

He gets down on his hands and knees and examines the bloodstain. 
He sees the skirt on the bedspread. He lifts it. He is nose to 
nose with JUD, who is dead with his eyes open, an expression of 
incredible horror on his face.

The DOOR SLAMS.

LOUIS bolts to his feet as GIGGLES fade down the hall.

Slowly, he kneels down and speaks to the skirt of the spread, 
which has mercifully fallen back into place.

				LOUIS
		I'm sorry, Jud. I'm so sorry. I'm--

There's a SQUEAKING, SQUEALING SOUND.

LOUIS turns around. He gets up again. He starts for the door. Then 
he turns back and speaks to JUD again.

				LOUIS
		I'm going to set things back in
		order. I...I know just what to do.

He goes out.

INT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH LOUIS

He takes one of the two remaining loaded syringes from his breast 
pocket.

				LOUIS
		Gage?

Another SQUEAKING SOUND. And another GIGGLE.

LOUIS starts slowly forward. He gets about halfway down the hall--
and our nerves are tuned to the breaking point--when there is a 
SQUEALING CREAK and a GRATING THUMP from overhead.

INT.  CEILING TRAPDOOR

This happens fast. The trap--which presumably gives on the attic 
with a set of folding stairs--rises, and RACHEL'S body plunges 
down through and then hangs, swinging: she has been bound around 
the armpits and as become a grotesque parody of MISSY DANDRIDGE.

Half her face is gone. Eaten.

INT.  LOUIS

He SCREAMS and backs against the wall. Twang! The last silver 
thread parts.

INT.  THE TRAPDOOR, WITH GAGE

He leaps down, crashes on the floor, and then picks himself up. He 
is waving the scalpel.

				GAGE (screeching)
		Allee-allee-in-free! allee-allee-
		in-free! Allee-allee-in-free!

INT.  LOUIS AND GAGE

I won't choreograph all the moves, but GAGE slashes his stunned 
father up pretty badly with the scalpel. He's screeching the whole 
time. LOUIS finally begins to react. He grapples with the little 
critter, and tries to get the syringe into him. No good. It's 
batted out of his hand just before he can do it. It breaks.

LOUIS and GAGE fall to the floor. LOUIS gets the other syringe out 
of his pocket, but it's also knocked out of his hand. Only 
consolation is this one isn't broken. It rolls off along the 
floor. LOUIS finally manages to get it again as the struggle goes 
on, and plunges it into GAGE'S neck.

				GAGE
		No fair! NO FAIR!

He gets to his feet, clawing for the needle lolling out of his 
neck. He's lost all interest in his father. He goes staggering 
away. He's slowing down. He goes to his knees...and falls on his 
face.

LOUIS watches this... and then his vacant, half-catatonic gaze 
goes to:

INT.  RACHEL, LOUIS'S POV

She swings slowly back and forth.

EXT.  THE BACK YARD OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE

Time has passed. It's late afternoon. LOUIS comes out with a 
sheet-wrapped form in his arms. RACHEL, of course.

He sets the body down and goes back inside.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS

He's splashing around a can of coal-oil. When he's got the room 
wetted down to his satisfaction, he goes to the door, lights a 
match, and tosses it.

Flame runs across the floor. The fire is slow at first, but then 
it begins to gain rapidly.

LOUIS goes out.

EXT.  THE BACK LAWN, WITH LOUIS

He picks up the sheet-wrapped form of his wife and walks around 
the side of the house as flames shoot through the kitchen windows.

EXT.  THE FRONT OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE, FROM ACROSS THE ROAD

LOUIS appears with his shrouded burden and approaches the road.

EXT.  THE SMOULDERING RUINS OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE  NIGHT

CAMERA HOLDS FOR A MOMENT, then rises and looks toward the CREED 
house. There's one light on--in the kitchen.

TOLLING CONTINUES: Three...four...five...

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH LOUIS

LOUIS is filthy, covered with dried blood. He is playing at 
Patience. He holds a handful of cards.

TOLLING CONTINUES: Six...seven...

SOUND: The back door opens.

SOUND: Crickets from outside. Ree-ree-ree...

SOUND: Gritting footsteps.

LOUIS looks up. He doesn't look behind, at what's coming. He looks 
straight ahead.

				LOUIS
		And what you own always comes home
		to you.

He flips up one card.

TOLLING CONTINUES: Eight...

INT.  THE CARD

It's the Bitch, the Queen of Spades, she who supposedly poisoned 
the laddies in the Tower.

LOUIS'S hand falls upon it.

TOLLING CONTINUES: Nine...ten...

INT.  LOUIS, CU

A hand clotted with grave-dirt falls on his shoulder. A woman's 
hand.

TOLLING CONCLUDES: Eleven...twelve...

				RACHEL (voice)
		Darling.

FADE OUT ON THE SOUND OF CRICKETS.
"PET SEMATARY"

			      by

			 Stephen King






FADE IN ON

that most persistent summer SOUND: crickets in high grass--
ree-ree-ree-ree... This in dark which slowly

						DISSOLVES TO:

EXT.  A GRAVE MARKER  SUMMER DAY

It's a plywood cross leaning aslant. Written on the crossarm in 
black paint which has faded: SMUCKY  HE WAS OBEDIENT. The letters 
are faded. They are also straggling and ill-formed--the work of a 
child.

MAIN TITLES BEGIN.

EXT.  ANOTHER GRAVE MARKER

A child's printing again, this time on a chunk of warped crating: 
BIFFER BIFFER A HELLUVA SNIFFER UNTIL HE DIED HE MADE US RICHER  
1971-1974.

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE

EXT.  TWO MARKERS

I think all these shots are LAP DISSOLVES. All is silence but for 
the crickets and the wind stirring the grass. Around the markers 
themselves, the grass has been clipped short, and by some markers 
there are flowers in cheap vases. Crisco cans, Skippy peanut 
butter jars, etc.

These two markers: IN MEMORY OF MARTA OUR PET RABIT DYED MARCH 1, 
1965 (on a wide flat board) and GEN PATTON (OUR! GOOD! DOG!) APRIL 
1958 (another board).

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE

EXT.  FIVE OR SIX MARKERS

We can't read all of them; some are too faded (or the 
"gravestones" themselves too degenerated), but we can see now that 
this woodland clearing's a rather eerie -- and well-populated -- 
animal graveyard.

We can see: POLYNESIA, 1953 and HANNAH THE BEST DOG THAT EVER 
LIVED. HANNAH'S tombstone is part of an old Chevrolet hood, 
painstakingly hammered flat.

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE.

EXT.  ANGLE ON THE PET SEMATARY

From here we can see most of the clearing, which is surrounded by 
forest pines. We can see that the graves--maybe 80 in all--are 
arranged in rough concentric circles. On the far side of this 
clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard 
clearing. The end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which 
hold up a crude arch. We can see no writing on this side -- the 
words on the arch face those arriving along the path.

MAIN TITLES CONTINUE

EXT.  THE ARCH, FROM THE PATH SIDE, CU

MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE. Written on the arch in faded black paint is 
the work of some long-gone child: PET SEMATARY.

THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS FOR A MOMENT OR TWO, THEN PANS SLOWLY 
DOWN to look through the arch. From this angle we are looking 
across to a deadfall--a tangle of weather-whitened old dead 
branches at the back of the graveyard. It's maybe twenty-five feet 
from side to side and about nine feet high. At either end are 
thick tangles of underbrush that look impassible.

AS MAIN TITLES CONCLUDE, THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the 
deadfall. And as it does, we realize that there is a horrible 
snarling face in those branches. Is this an accident? Coincidence? 
Our imagination? Perhaps the audience will wonder. THE CAMERA 
HOLDS ON IT and then we

							DISSOLVE TO:

BLACK. And a white title card: MOVING DAY.

EXT.  A HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY  EVENING

SOUND of crickets: ree-ree-ree-ree...

To the left of this house: a big empty field. Behind it: the 
woods. Before it: a wide two-lane road.

The house is a pleasant two-story New England dwelling with a 
shed/garage attached. In front of it is a sign which reads QUINN 
REALTORS 292 HAMMOND STREET, BANGOR. A big SOLD strip, like a 
bumper sticker, has been plastered across it diagonally.

GROWING SOUND: the rumble of a truck. A big, big truck. It belts 
between the CAMERA and the house -- a tanker truck with a silver 
body and the word ORINCO written on the side in blue letters. Its 
short-stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke. Behind it 
comes a Ford wagon, which slows, signals, and turns into the 
driveway of the house we've been looking at.

EXT.  REAR OF THE WAGON

As LOUIS CREED brings it to a stop we get a good look at the 
license plate (Illinois) and a bumper sticker (HAVE YOU HUGGED 
YOUR M.D. TODAY?)

The ENGINE SOUND stops. For a moment or two we hear only the ree-
ree-ree-ree of crickets. Then:

				ELLIE CREED (voice)
		Is this our new house, daddy?

				LOUIS CREED (voice)
		This is it.

EXT.  THE WAGON, A NEW ANGLE

The two front doors and one back door open. LOUIS CREED, about 32, 
gets out from the driver's side. RACHEL CREED, his wife, gets out 
from the passenger side. From the rear door comes ELLIE CREED, a 
girl of 6. They are staring, fascinated, at the house.

They come together, the three of them, by the front of the wagon, 
still staring at the house. LOUIS is clearly nervous.

				LOUIS
		So...what do you think?

RACHEL begins to smile. She turns to LOUIS and hugs him.

				RACHEL
		It's gorgeous!

				ELLIE
		Am I really gonna have my own room?

				LOUIS
		Yes.

				ELLIE
		Yaay!

She looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging 
down from the bough of a tree.

				ELLIE (to RACHEL)
		Is that a swing?

				RACHEL
		Yes, but the rope might be--

				ELLIE
		Yaay!

She goes running toward it. RACHEL gives LOUIS a tired smile.

				LOUIS
		Let her go. It's cool.

				RACHEL
		Louis, the house is beautiful.

They kiss--gently at first, then more passionately. As he draws 
her more tightly against him, a baby--GAGE--begins to cry from the 
car. LOUIS and RACHEL break the clinch.

				RACHEL
		The Master of Disaster awakes.

This SOUND is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent-up tomcat.

				LOUIS
		And Buckaroo Banzai.

				RACHEL
		Come on--let's parole 'em.

They walk to the car, RACHEL going to one of the back seat doors, 
LOUIS to the rear of the wagon.

INT.  THE FRONT SEAT, WITH RAHEL AND GAGE

GAGE is sitting in his car seat, not exactly crying but certainly 
yelling to be let out. The seat, dash, and floorboards are 
littered with roadmaps, soda cans, Big Mac boxes, and similar 
crud. These folks have driven all the way from Chicago to Maine in 
this station wagon, and the wagon looks it.

				RACHEL
		Decided to wake up and see what home
		looks like, huh?

She begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses. GAGE is just 
wearing a t-shirt and a diaper. He's fifteen months old.

EXT.  THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS

He opens the doorgate and lifts out a cat carrier. We see a big 
tomcat inside--mostly what we're aware of are shining green eyes.

				ELLIE (voice)
		Daddy! Mommy! I see a path!

LOUIS, cat carrier still in hand, turns toward:

EXT.  ELLIE IN THE TIRE SWING

She's got it penduluming back and forth in long wide arcs.

EXT.  THE VIEW UP TOWARD THE WOODS, ELLIE'S POV

We see the field, and a clearly marked and mown path leading up 
its flank and into the dark woods.

THE CAMERA DIPS AND PENDULUMS as ELLIE swings.

EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE (FRONT OF THE CAR)

				RACHEL (irritated)
		Not so high, Ellie! You don't know
		how strong that rope is.

She puts GAGE down. He totters a bit on his little legs and then 
stands there, looking at his sister.

EXT.  THE ROPE AND THE BRANCH, CU

The bark has rubbed off the branch--it looks like a bone peeping 
through decayed flesh. The rope is old, discolored. And it is 
fraying away as we look at it. Soon ELLIE, like Humpty Dumpty, is 
going to have a great fall.

EXT.  LOUIS (REAR OF THE CAR)

He's set the cat-carrier down and is straightening up.

				ELLIE (raptuous voice)
		Wheee!

				LOUIS
		Ellie, you heard your m---

His eyes widen.

EXT.  ELLIE

				ELLIE
		Wh--

SOUND: A heavy twang! as the rope breaks. The tire swing--with 
ELLIE still inside it--goes crashing to the grass. ELLIE screams 
and begins to cry--a little hurt and a lot surprised.

LOUIS and RACHEL run to her.

			LOUIS				RACHEL
	Ellie! Are you all right?	Honey? Are you okay?

EXT.  ELLIE, RACHEL, LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT

ELLIE'S parents reach the tangle of tire, rope, and six-year-old 
girl.

				ELLIE
		Hurrts! It hurrrrts!

				LOUIS
		Anyone who can scream that loud isn't
		ready for intensive care just yet--
		looks like she just skinned her knee.

Nevertheless, he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from 
the tire. RACHEL helps.

EXT.  GAGE

He's standing in the driveway by the front of the car, utterly 
forgotten in the heat of the moment. His diaper is sagging quite a 
bit; the boy needs a change.

He stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit, then loses 
interest. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he walks down the side of the station 
wagon, little bare feet slapping on the asphalt. He stops for a 
moment at the back, looking at the cat-carrier, which LOUIS never 
got around to opening. CHURCH is staring hopefully out through the 
mesh.

				GAGE
		Hi-Durch!

				CHURCH
		Waow!

GAGE bends down and tries to open the cat-carrier's door. No soap. 
Either he can't solve the latch or his fingers don't have the 
strength. Anyway, he stops trying after a moment.

SOUND: Growing thunder of an approaching truck - a big one.

EXT.  THE ROAD (GAGE'S POV)

A big tanker truck--silver body, ORINCO written on the side in 
blue letters--blasts by.

EXT.  GAGE, BY THE CAT CARRIER

The windlash if the passing truck blows GAGE'S hair back from his 
forehead. We should be scared here--not by the truck, but by 
GAGE'S lack of fear. He's smiling, happy.

				GAGE
		Druck!

He starts down the driveway toward the road.

EXT.  LOUIS, RACHEL, ELLIE (AT THE SWING)

ELLIE has been disentangled from the swing. She's sitting by the 
wreckage at the end of the driveway, weeping hysterically (as much 
from tiredness as from pain, I think) as LOUIS and RACHEL examine 
her scraped knee. The wound doesn't look too serious.

				LOUIS (to RACHEL)
		Would you get the first aid kit?

				ELLIE (screaming)
		Not the stingy stuff! I don't want the
		stingy stuff, daddy!

RACHEL suddenly looks around toward:

EXT.  THE FRONT OF THE WAGON (RACHEL'S POV)

No one there.

EXT.  RACHEL, ELLIE, LOUIS, BY THE SWING

				RACHEL
		Gage's gone!

				LOUIS
		Jesus, the road!

They get up together.

EXT.  GAGE, AT THE EDGE OF THE ROAD

A truck is coming. A great big one.

EXT.  ANGLE ON THE TRUCK, CU

The grille looks like a tombstone that's learned how to snarl.

EXT.  GAGE

He takes a step into the road...and then big, gnarled hands grab 
him.

GAGE looks rather surprised at this, but not worried--this kid is 
used to being picked up and treated humanely. To GAGE strangers 
are as interesting as...well, as interesting as Orinco trucks.

EXT.  GAGE AND JUD CRANDALL

The fellow who has picked GAGE up is a man of about eighty in old 
blue jeans, a faded Bruce Springsteen t-shirt. Over this he wears 
a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons. His face is deeply 
wrinkled and kindly.

				JUD CRANDALL (to GAGE)
		No you don't, my friend--not in
		that road.

But he softens this with a grin. GAGE grins back at him.

				GAGE
		Drucks!

				JUD (low)
		No shit, Sherlock.

JUD carries him up the driveway to the station wagon. Here he's 
joined by LOUIS and RACHEL, out of breath and really scared. ELLIE 
brings up the rear. She's still sniffling.

				RACHEL
		Gage!

				JUD (hands him to her)
		He was headed for the road, looked
		like. I corralled him for you, missus.

				RACHEL
		Thank you. Thank you so much.

				LOUIS
		Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.

He sticks out his hand and JUD shakes it. LOUIS takes it easy--no 
crushing JayCees grip, or anything like that--the old guy looks as 
if he might have arthritis.

				JUD
		Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.

				RACHEL
		I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving
		the wandering minstrel boy, here.

				JUD
		No harm, no foul. But you want to watch
		out for that road. Those damn trucks go
		back and forth all day and most of the
		night.

He leans over toward ELLIE.

				JUD
		Who might you be, little Miss?

				ELLIE
		I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642
		Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. (Pause)
		At least, I used to.

				JUD
		And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow,
		and your dad's gonna be the new doctor
		up to the college, I hear, and I think
		you're going to be just as happy as a
		clam here, Ellen Creed.

				ELLIE (to LOUIS)
		Are clams really happy?

They all laugh--even GAGE.

				RACHEL
		Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to
		change this kid. It's nice to meet you.

				JUD
		Same here. Come over and visit when
		you get the chance.

As RACHEL, carrying GAGE, moves away:

				ELLIE (worries)
		Daddy, do I really have to have the
		stingy stuff?

				LOUIS
		No-I guess not.

				ELLIE
		Yayyy!

She goes belting off.

				JUD (amused)
		I guess your daughter there ain't
		going to die after all.

				LOUIS (also amused)
		I guess not.

				JUD
		House has stood empty for too long.
		It's damn good to see people in it again.

SOUND: A truck engine, gearing down.

EXT.  A MOVING VAN

It blinks and comes lumbering into the Creed's driveway.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

				LOUIS
		Hey--they actually found the place!

				JUD
		Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I
		usually sit out on my porch of an evening
		and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner.
		Come on over and join me, if you want.

				LOUIS
		Well, maybe I----

				RACHEL (voice)
		Louis, what's this?

EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE

GAGE has been changed, and RACHEL is following him as he explores 
the nearest edges of the new homestead. They are fairly close to 
the wreckage of the tire swing, and here is the head of the path 
ELLIE has already glimpsed.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

They cross to the van. The FIRST and SECOND MOVERS are just 
climbing out of the van.

				FIRST MOVER
		You Mr. Creed?

				LOUIS
		Yes. Just a second.

EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH

She's holding GAGE on her hip now, and both of them are looking at 
that strange (and oddly enticing) path which disappears into the 
deepening twilight. LOUIS and JUD join them.

				LOUIS
		The movers--

				RACHEL
		Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does
		it go?

				LOUIS
		I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw
		the house, this field was under four feet
		of snow.

				RACHEL (smiling)
		I bet Mr. Crandall knows!

JUD nods. He smiles, too, but underneath the smile we sense that 
he is serious.

				JUD
		Oh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and
		a good walk, too. I'll take you up there
		sometime, and tell you the story, too--
		after you get settled in.

He smiles at them and they smile back--it is a look of 
understanding and real liking, in spite of the age difference 
between the CREEDS and JUD.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT

SOUND: Crickets. Ree--ree--ree-ree... 

There's one light upstairs, one downstairs. Perhaps we see the 
path, glimmering away into the field? Either by virtue of it being 
mown, or by virtue of some gentle optical trick? Maybe.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

There's a light on in the kitchen, but it just casts a dim glow in 
here. The room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor. It's 
going to be nice, but now it's just a big bare box with movers' 
cartons stacked all over the place.

LOUIS is drinking a can of Pepsi, and he looks pretty damned 
tired--anyone who's ever moved house and can remember the first 
night in the new place will understand.

He finishes the last of the Pepsi and surveys the living room. He 
sits on one of the bigger boxes, takes cigarettes from his pocket, 
and lights one. He drops the spent match in the empty can, and 
taps into the can during the scene.

SOUND: Feet coming down the stairs. The door on the far side of 
the room opens and RACHEL comes in, wearing a nightgown.

				RACHEL (crossing to LOUIS)
		Kids are asleep, doc.

				LOUIS
		Great.

He hugs her. She hugs him back warmly--for a moment they are just 
two good people in all the big darkness of their new house.

				RACHEL
		You're not really going over to have a
		beer with that old guy, are you?

				LOUIS
		Well, I've got a million questions about
		the area, and---

				RACHEL
		---and you'll end up doing a free
		consultation on his arthritis or urinary
		problems and---

				LOUIS
		Did you see his shirt?

				RACHEL (giggles)
		Sure. Bruce Springsteen.

				LOUIS
		I really do have a million questions
		about the area...but the thing I'm
		really curious about is how come this
		octogenarian Yankee is decorating the
		slumped remains of his pecs with the
		Boss.

She laughs.

EXT.  THE PATH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE  NIGHT

Pervasive SOUND of the crickets as LOUIS comes rather hesitantly 
up the crazy-paved path from the road's edge.

				JUD (voice)
		That you, doc?

EXT.  THE SCREENED-IN PORCH OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE

We hear the SQUEAK of a rocker; we see the dim red fitful glow of 
JUD'S Pall Mall. We see by its glow that he is wearing Walkman 
earphones.

EXT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS
		It's me.

INT.  THE PORCH, WITH JUD

The Walkman is in his lap. He switches it off and puts the 
headphones casually around his neck, like a kid.

				JUD
		Well, come on up and have a beer.

INT.  THE PORCH, A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT

LOUIS comes on up. JUD has got a pail of ice beside his chair with 
some cans of beer in it. He opens one and hands it to LOUIS.

				JUD
		You need a glass?

				LOUIS
		Not at all.

				JUD
		Good for you.

LOUIS drinks half the can at a draught.

				LOUIS
		God, that's fine.

				JUD
		Ain't it just? The man who invented
		beer, Louis, that man was having a
		prime day for himself.

				LOUIS
		What were you listening to?

				JUD
		Allman Brothers.

				LOUIS
		What?

				JUD
		The Eat A Peach album. God, they were
		good before drugs and bad luck caught
		up with them. Listen to this, Louis.

He passes the headphones over. LOUIS puts them on. JUD presses the 
Walkman's PLAY button.

SOUND: Ramblin' Man blasts us out of our seats.

LOUIS winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head.

				JUD
		I'm sorry. Wait.

He turns it down.

				JUD
		Try that.

LOUIS puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments. 
It's the instrumental break. Gregg and Duane Allman dueling hot 
Fenders. LOUIS takes the earphones off.

				LOUIS
		Nice.

				JUD
		I like rock and roll. No...I guess
		that's too mild. I love it. Since
		my ears started to die out on me,
		it's the only music I can really hear.
		And since my wife died...I dunno, some-
		times a little rock and roll fills up
		night. Not always, but sometimes. (Pause)
		One more time--welcome to Ludlow. Hope
		your time here will be a happy one.

				LOUIS (great sincerity)
		Thank you, Mr. Crandall.

He drinks again--they both do. There's a moment of companionable 
silence here, broken by the SOUND of a big truck. They look 
toward:

EXT/INT.  THE ROAD (THROUGH THE PORCH SCREEN)

One of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by--now there are 
little amber running lights on top of it. It's going fast, too-- 
sweeps by in a blast of air.

INT.  THE PORCH, WITH LOUIS AND JUD

				LOUIS (wincing)
		Jesus!

				JUD (lights a cigarette)
		That's one mean road, all right--you
		remember that path your wife commented on?

				LOUIS
		The one that goes into the woods--sure.

				JUD
		That road--and those Orinco trucks--
		are the two main reasons it's there.

				LOUIS
		What's at the end of it?

				JUD (smiles)
		Another day--after you get settled in a
		bit. Meantime, doc---

Here JUD raises his glass in a toast.

				JUD (continues)
		Here's to your bones.

LOUIS clinks his glass against JUD'S.

				LOUIS
		And yours.

They drink.

EXT.  ROUTE 9  NIGHT

LOUIS crosses from the CRANDALL side to his own, and the CAMERA 
FOLLOWS as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon. He 
pauses for a moment, looking thoughtfully--hopefully--at his new 
house. Then something--the CRY of an OWL, perhaps--draws his 
attention the other way...toward the path.

He walks to its head and stands looking out at it--it glimmers in 
a wide cut swath that's a bit ghostly in the dark.

A SHAPE suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him, and LOUIS 
recoils with a startled, muffled cry.

EXT.  CHURCH

The cat, sure; who--or what--else? We see his big green eyes in 
the dark as he cries his strange feline hello: Waow!

EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH

				LOUIS
		Church! God, you scared the life
		out of me!

				CHURCH
		Waow!

LOUIS bends and picks up the cat. As he does, that truck SOUND 
comes again and he looks toward:

EXT.  THE ROAD, LOUIS'S POV

Another Orinco tanker drones by, fast.

EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH

				LOUIS (to the cat)
		I know one thing that will keep you
		home, good buddy.

He starts toward the house.

BLACK. And in that blackness, we see a second title card: THE DEAD 
SPEAK.

INT.  A KITCHEN BLACKBOARD, CU  DAY

Written on it is: MONDAY 1.) CHURCH SPAYED 10 A.M. QUENTIN 
JOLANDER, D.V.M. And below, in even bigger letters: 2.) ELLIE'S 
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL!!

THE CAMERA PANS LEFT, showing us the kitchen. There are still a 
few cardboard cartons around, but the place is getting in shape.

We look out the window and see the CREEDS, led by JUD CRANDALL, 
climbing the path toward the woods. LOUIS has got GAGE in a 
Gerrypak.

EXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH CREEDS AND JUD

They are also at the edge of the woods. JUD stops and lets them 
catch up.

				JUD
		Take a look behind you.

They turn around, and their faces express their wonder.

				LOUIS
		My God!

				RACHEL
		It's beautiful!

EXT.  THE VIEW

It is indeed beautiful. The CREED house is in the f.g., Route 9 
just behind it (with one of the ever-present Orinco trucks droning 
along), but behind that is the great sweep of the Penobscot river 
valley, dozing under a fall sky of clear blue.

EXT.  AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, WITH JUD AND THE CREEDS

				JUD
		You folks ready to go on?

				LOUIS
		Sure.

				ELLIE
		But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?

				JUD
		You'll see soon enough, hon.

They go into the woods, still following the path.

EXT.  FOREST  DAY

These are old woods indeed--huge trunks with dusty sunlight 
shafting through them. It looks as though man has never made his 
mark here.

THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN to them, on the path. Here it is 
carpeted with pine needles, but it is just as clearly marked.

JUD stops. LOUIS looks glad of the rest; he's sweating and there 
are wide dark patches under his arms where the Gerrypak's straps 
are.

				LOUIS
		Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper
		companies?

				JUD
		Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up
		ahead is all that's left of their
		tribal lands.

				ELLIE (giggling)
		Micmac, Ricmac, Kickmac, Sickmac.

				JUD (smiles)
		Ayuh, it's a funny word, ain't it?
		You tired of totin' that yowwen yet, doc?

				LOUIS
		Not yet...how much further is it?

				JUD
		Aw, you'll be okay. Less than a mile.

He starts off again, fresh as a daisy. ELLIE scampers after him. 
LOUIS rolls his eyes at his wife and RACHEL rolls hers back. Then 
they press on.

EXT.  THE ARCH READING PET SEMATARY

EXT.  JUD AND THE CREEDS, ON THE PATH

				JUD (stopping)
		This is the place, honey.

ELLIE is of course second. Se tries to read the words on the arch 
but can't. She whips around to look at her mother.

				ELLIE
		What's it say, mommy?

A strange expression has come over RACHEL'S face--she doesn't like 
this. Not a bit.

				RACHEL
		It says Pet Cemetery, hon. It's
		misspelled, but...that's what it
		says.

She runs for the arch. RACHEL starts; looks more uneasy than ever.

				RACHEL
		Ellen--!

EXT.  ELLIE

She's almost under the arch. She looks back, questioning.

EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD

				RACHEL (a bit lame)
		Be careful.

EXT.  ELLIE

She goes racing into the Pet Sematary.

EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD

JUD lights a cigarette with a wooden match, using his thumbnail.

				JUD
		I told you it was a bad road,
		Louis--it's killed a lot of pets
		and made a lot of kids unhappy.
		But at least something good come
		of it. This place.

				ELLIE (excited voice)
		Mom! Dad! Y'oughtta see it!

EXT.  ELLIE, AT THE EDGE OF THE SEMATARY

She surveys the rude markers with puzzled delight, then runs 
toward the center, pausing to investigate some of the markers as 
she goes. We clearly see the symmetrical pattern of rings.

EXT.  RACHEL, LOUIS, JUD

They are walking slowly toward that rude archway. LOUIS is 
extremely interested in all this, but it's becoming clearer and 
clearer that RACHEL is troubled. They stop and look in.

				RACHEL
		How can you call it a good thing?
		A graveyard for pets killed in the
		road! Built and maintained by broken-
		hearted children!

				JUD
		Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't
		quite that way, deah!

				LOUIS
		I think it's rather extraordinary.

				RACHEL
		Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.

She's growing more and more upset. JUD looks at her curiously.

				JUD
		Well...they have to learn about death
		somehow, now don't they, Missus Creed?
		The little ones?

				RACHEL (coldly)
		Why?

				JUD
		Well...well, because--

				ELLIE (voice)
		Mommy! Daddy! Look at me!

EXT.  ELLIE, ON THE DEADFALL

She has begun to climb it, and this looks like an extremely 
dangerous proposition. ELLIE, however, is having the time of her 
life. A branch breaks under one of her feet and she switches 
nimbly to the next one up.

EXT.  THE GROWNUPS, AT THE ARCH

				JUD (alarmed)
		No, honey! You don't want to go
		climbing on that! Come on down!

He hurries in.

EXT.  ELIIE, ON THE DEADFALL

She looks back at JUD.

				ELLIE
		It's okay, Mr. Crandall--

EXT.  ELLIE'S FOOT, CU

The branch she's on breaks with a dry CRRRACK. Her foot drops down 
suddenly.

EXT.  ELLIE AND JUD

She totters backward, pinwheeling her arms, and JUD catches her as 
she falls. Not much of a catch because she wasn't too far up.

LOUIS joins JUD and ELLIE. GAGE jounces along on his back.

				LOUIS
		Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?

				ELLIE
		Well, I thought it was safe--

				JUD
		Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns
		like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.

				ELLIE
		Bite?

				JUD
		Ayuh.

EXT.  RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH

Her discomfort makes one thing very clear--she doesn't want to 
come in.

				RACHEL (calls)
		Is she all right, Louis?

EXT.  LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE

				LOUIS (calls back)
		Fine! Come and see!

EXT.  RACHEL, STANDING AT THE ARCH

				RACHEL (calling)
		I think I'll sit this one out, doc.

EXT.  LOUIS, JUD, ELLIE--BY THE DEADFALL

				ELLIE
		I want to look around, daddy--
		may I?

				LOUIS
		For a little while.

JUD looks toward:

EXT.  RACHEL AT THE ARCH (ELLEN IN F.G.)

RACHEL has retreated a bit. She sits on the pine needle carpet of 
the path, opens her purse, and draws out cigarettes.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

JUD looks at LOUIS as if to say "What's all this about?" LOUIS 
looks away.

				ELLIE (voice)
		Dad! Daddy! Look! A goldfishie!

EXT.  ELLIE

She runs from one tombstone to the next, cheerful as maybe only a 
kid could be in such a place. She looks at BIFFER'S tombstone; at 
SMUCKY'S.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

They are walking slowly toward her. LOUIS is looking at the 
tombstones.

				LOUIS
		I can hardly read these.

				JUD
		Ayuh--they get older as you go
		toward the middle. (Points) Pete
		LaVasseur's dog is buried there...
		(points) the Stoppard boys' racing
		pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat 
		got...and I think that's the cat 
		himself right there, although it's
		been so many years I can't tell for
		sure.
				(calling)
		Missy Ellen! Come over here just a 
		minute!

EXT.  ELLEN

She runs amid the tombstones--they have worked their way near to 
the center and there are quite a few of them--and joins the 
adults.

				JUD
		I see you're quite a reader for such
		a little girl. Can you read that?

He points again, and Ellen goes over for a look-see.

EXT.  ELLEN, AT THE GRAVE MARKER

It is a small slate marker slanted to one side. ELLEN reads the 
words laboriously, tracing them with her finger.

				ELLEN
		"Spot a good fellow we love you boy."
		(Pause) "Owned by Judson...Judson..."
		Gee, I can't read the rest.

EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS

				JUD
		Last name's Crandall, little missy.

LOUIS looks at him sharply as ELLIE rejoins them.

				JUD
		That's where I buried my dog Spot
		when he died of old age in 19 and
		14. Dug it good and deep. By the
		time I finished, I had blisters all
		over my hands and a hell of a crick
		in my back. Soil's stony up here.

ELLIE looks awed. LOUIS looks a little awed, too.

JUD sweeps a hand around, indicating the whole sematary, but is 
still looking at ELLEN.

				JUD
		Do you know what this place is,
		Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a
		boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing
		and even a whole pile of 'em don't
		amount to much. Do you know what a
		graveyard really is?

				ELLIE
		Well...I guess not.

				JUD
		It's a place where the dead speak,
		Missy.

He sees her startled, uneasy expression and laughs. He ruffles her 
hair reassuringly.

				JUD
		No--not right out loud. Their stones
		speak...or their markers. Even if the 
		marker ain't nothing but a tin can
		someone wrote on with a Magic Marker,
		it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?

				LOUIS
		I think it is so, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		What if you can't read what's
		written on there anymore?

				JUD
		Well, it still says some animal got
		laid down here after, don't it?

				ELLIE
		Yes--

				LOUIS
		And that someone cared enough about
		that animal to mark the spot.

				ELLIE
		To remember.

				JUD (smiles)
		Yes. To remember. This ain't a scary
		place, Ellie. It's a place of rest
		and speaking. Can you remember that?

				ELLIE (a little awed)
		Yes, sir.

They start to walk slowly back toward the arch.

EXT.  RACHEL, OUTSIDE THE ARCH

It's clear she's impatient and out-of-sorts with the whole thing.

				RACHEL (calls)
		Louis, can we go? I'm tired!

EXT.  LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD

				ELLIE
		Mommy! This is a place where dead
		animals talk! Mr. Crandall said so!

EXT.  RACHEL AND ELLIE

But RACHEL is not amused. She doesn't like any of this.

				RACHEL (soft)
		Did he.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

				LOUIS
		My wife is not crazy about cemeteries
		of any kind. As you may have noticed.

				JUD
		Me neither. But I believe in knowing
		your enemy.

LOUIS looks at him, startled, then decides this is a joke. He 
laughs. JUD smiles, a trifle thinly.

EXT.  THE ARCH, A NEW ANGLE

The men rejoin RACHEL and ELLIE.

				LOUIS (voice)
		Did we take too long?

				RACHEL (curt)
		Well, if supper's burned, I'm not
		the one going out for pizza.

They move away.

EXT.  THE DEADFALL, FROM THE ARCH

The face we saw at the beginning of the movie wasn't there when 
the visitors were there...but it's sure there now, leering at us.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TRASH CAN  NIGHT

There are two greasy boxes poking out with NAPOLI PIZZA stamped on 
them. Guess dinner was burned.

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK and we se LOUIS sitting at the kitchen 
table. The table is covered with newspapers. On it, LOUIS is 
putting together a complicated model boat, using glue and 
tweezers. He's wearing glasses.

ELLIE comes in, wearing a nightgown. She watches him for awhile.

				LOUIS (not looking around)
		Hi, babe.

				ELLIE
		Daddy, that Pet Sematary is there
		because of the road, isn't it?

LOUIS looks around at her, surprised.

				ELLIE
		That's what I think. I heard
		Missy Dandridge tell Mom when
		Church was fixed he wouldn't
		cross the road so much.

				LOUIS
		Well, it's always better to take
		precautions--but I'm sure Church
		will be all right, honey...

INT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN DOOR

RACHEL is coming along with some dirty dishes. She hears voices 
and stops, listening, her face troubled and afraid.

				ELLIE (voice)
		No he won't! Not in the end! He won't
		be all right in the end no matter how
		you fix 'im!

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

Ellis has started to cry.

				ELLIE
		In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?

				LOUIS
		Lovey...Church might be still alive when
		you're in a high school...and that's a
		very long time.

				ELLIE
		It doesn't seem long to me. It seems
		short. I think the whole thing about
		pets dying s-s-sucks!

Poor kid's bawling her eyes out now. LOUIS folds her into his arms 
and she hugs him tightly, wanting his comfort.

				LOUIS
		If it was up to me I'd let Church live
		to be a hundred...but I don't make up
		the rules.

				ELLIE (muffled)
		Well who does? God, I suppose. But he's
		not God's cat! He's my cat! Let God get
		His own, if He wants one! Not mine! Not
		mine! Not--

She breaks down completely, sobbing, and LOUIS rocks her back and 
forth.

INT.  THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL

She is crying silently.

INT.  ELLIE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

She is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness. An oblong shaft of 
light falls on her, illuminating her more clearly. She's asleep 
with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her 
mouth.

INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH RACHEL

RACHEL looks at her daughter with infinite love and then quietly 
closes the door.

INT.  LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

LOUIS is in his pajamas, propped up on pillows on his side of the 
bed. There a number of medical books scattered around him and he's 
making notes from one as RACHEL comes in.

				RACHEL
		She's finally asleep.

				LOUIS
		She was a little over-excited,
		that's all. Poor kid.

				RACHEL
		It was that place. That creepy cemetery
		up in the woods. Whatever disease the
		kids in this town have got, I don't want
		Ellie to catch it.

				LOUIS
		Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?

				RACHEL
		Do you think I didn't hear her tonight,
		crying as if her heart would break?
		Here she is thinking Church is going to
		die.

It should be clear to us by now that, despite her words, RACHEL is 
much more upset than ELLIE was. LOUIS slowly puts his notebook 
aside and caps his pen.

				LOUIS
		Rachel...someday Church is going to 
		die.

				RACHEL (whirls on him)
		That is hardly the point! Church is
		not going to die today, or tomorrow--
		Never mind. I can see you don't have
		the slightest idea what I'm talking about.

She stalks to the bathroom, which adjoins. LOUIS follows. She goes 
in and slams the door. He goes for the knob.

				LOUIS
		Rachel--!

SOUND: CLICK OF THE LOCK.

LOUIS stares at the door, bewildered and upset.

EXT.  ROUTE 9  NIGHT

Here comes a big Orinco truck, droning along, headlights glaring.

INT.  LOUIS'S AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM

The headlights of the truck illuminate the room and we see LOUIS 
and RACHEL asleep, each as far over to his/her own side as he/she 
can get, with a big empty space in the middle.

Lights and TRUCK SOUNDS slowly fade.

INT.  GAGE  MORNING

Cheerful little clots of scrambled eggs are scattered all the way 
across the tray of his high-chair--it looks a little like a map of 
the Pacific islands done by a guy who only had a yellow crayon. 
Now he scoops up a handful and throws them.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE

Splat! Eggs on the serving plate of toast.

				ELLIE
		Yee-uck! Gross!

INT.  THE KITCHEN, A WIDER SHOT

RACHEL is at the sink, doing dishes (we see the blackboard with 
its message near her).

LOUIS comes in, wearing a sport-coat and slacks, ready for his 
first day on the job...and ELLIE is in a pretty first day of 
school dress.

				LOUIS
		He can't help it, babe. Emily Post is
		going to be beyond him for a few years.

INT.  BY THE KITCHEN DOOR

Here is the cat-carrier with CHURCH inside it. He waows unhappily.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH ELLIE AND GAGE

ELLIE gets down and goes across to the cat-carrier.

				ELLIE
		I don't want him to get his nuts
		cut, daddy! What if he dies?

INT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK

LOUIS looks shocked and amused by ELLIE'S colorful choice of 
words.

				LOUIS
		Good God! Where'd you hear that?

INT.  ELLIE

				ELLIE
		Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a
		operation!

INT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS, BY THE SINK

LOUIS tries to kiss RACHEL'S mouth. She turns her head slightly so 
he gets her cheek instead. She's still mad. LOUIS'S amusement 
dies.

				RACHEL
		Honey, Church will be fine.

INT.  ELLIE, BY THE CAT CARRIER

				ELLIE
		But what if he dies and has to
		go to the Pet Sematary?

INT.  LOUIS AND RACHEL, BY THE SINK

She gives him a look as if to say: "There! Now do you understand 
what you did?"

				RACHEL
		Don't be silly. Church is not going
		to die.

				LOUIS
		According to what Mr. Crandall says, the
		road's a lot more dangerous than the
		operation. Church will be just the same.
		Well--almost the same--and we won't have
		to worry about him getting turned into
		catburgers by one of those damn Orinco
		trucks.

At this RACHEL tightens up still more in that funny way--she's 
actually angered by LOUIS'S reference to catburgers--but under the 
anger we sense she is deeply shocked, as a prudish woman might be 
shocked by a dirty joke. For RACHEL, that's just what death is.

				RACHEL
		That's enough of that kind of talk!

				LOUIS
		I just said--

				RACHEL
		I know what you just said. Ellie,
		clear your place.

ELLIE goes slowly back to the table.

				ELLIE (sets the plate down)
		I'm scared. What if school here isn't
		like in Chicago! I'm scared and I want
		to go h-h-home!

ELLIE bursts into loud tears and puts her hands over her face.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, A NEW ANGLE (FEATURES LOUIS AND RACHEL)

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they go to the table to comfort ELLIE.

				RACHEL
		You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be
		excused. Go and wash your face.

				LOUIS
		And Church will be fine.

				ELLIE (anxious)
		Do you promise, Daddy?

				LOUIS
		Well, honey...you know that...

				RACHEL
		Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give
		the little girl her promise.

				LOUIS (reluctantly)
		Church will be fine. I promise.

				ELLIE
		Yayyyy!

She runs off, cheered up. And RACHEL is cheered up, too.

				RACHEL
		Thank you, Louis.

				LOUIS
		Oh, you're welcome. Only if some-
		thing should go wrong while he's under
		the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot,
		but it happens--you explain to her.

He gets up and leaves the table. She looks after him, stunned and 
a little frightened.

INT.  GAGE

				GAGE (conversationally)
		Here, Durch!

He picks up a large glob of scrambled eggs from his tray and 
throws it in the direction of the cat-carrier.

INT.  THE CAT-CARRIER

CHURCH is close to the mesh, looking out. Scrambled eggs hit the 
mesh, driving him back, surprised.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING

The school bus pulls up, red lights flashing. ELLIE runs toward it 
across the lawn, with her lunch-box.

EXT.  LOUIS, RACHEL, AND GAGE, IN THE FRONT DOORWAY

				RACHEL
		Have a great day!

LOUIS grabs GAGE'S hand and makes him wave it.

				GAGE
		Bye-bye!

EXT.  THE BUS

ELLIE climbs aboard. The red flashers go out and the bus pulls 
away.

EXT.  THE CREED DRIVEWAY  MORNING

The station wagon is parked there. LOUIS comes out with a heavy 
briefcase in one hand and the cat-carrier in the other. He opens 
the wagon's doorgate.

A small car turns into the CREED driveway and parks beside LOUIS. 
A rather sour-looking middle-aged woman gets out and crosses the 
front of her car. Her color is bad. This is MISSY DANDRIDGE. She 
looks at the cat-carrier.

				MISSY
		Gonna get his--

				LOUIS
		--nuts cut, yes. Thank you, Missy,
		for introducing that colorful phrase
		into my daughter's vocabulary.

				MISSY
		Don't mention it.

She opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat 
pile of folded sheets. She reaches for them, then winces and 
presses her hands against her midriff for a moment, as if with an 
attack of indigestion.

				LOUIS (sees this)
		How's that belly-ache of yours?

				MISSY (gets the sheets)
		No better and no worse.

				LOUIS
		You ought to see a doctor about it.

				MISSY
		It'll pass. They always do.

She starts toward the house with the sheets.

EXT.  THE SIDE YARD  MORNING

RACHEL hurries past MISSY, who turns to look and then goes on into 
the house. LOUIS has just put the cat-carrier into the back of the 
wagon and closed the doorgate as RACHEL reaches him.

				RACHEL (anxious)
		Still friends, doc?

LOUIS appears to consider this seriously for a moment...and then 
he smiles and hugs her. They kiss.

				RACHEL
		Thank God. I was a little worried
		there. Have a great first day at
		school, doc. No broken bones.

				LOUIS (smiles)
		Not so much as a sprain.

EXT.  VICTOR PASCOW AND FRIENDS  MORNING

PASCOW is in a blanket that is being carried by three boys and one 
girl. They are all yelling at each other not to joggle him, not to 
drop him. A small knot of horrified college kids moves with the 
bearers.

PASCOW'S head is upside down to the CAMERA, which retreats ahead 
of the advancing students. Fixed eyes stare. Half of his head has 
been shattered inward. Before the catastrophe he was a husky male 
of about twenty. He's dressed in a U of M muscle shirt and red 
jogging shorts.

THE CAMERA PULLS JERKILY TO ONE SIDE, allowing the bearers to 
mount the steps of a brick building. The infirmary. The lookers-on 
break to either side. The infirmary doors open.

EXT.. NURSE CHARLTON, AT THE DOORS

She's the head nurse, a tough old babe of about fifty.

				CHARLTON
		Holy Jesus.
				(turns)
		Steve! Steve! Dr. Creed! Dr. Creed,
		we've got a mess here! Stat!

The bearers sweep past her and inside, leaving a red smear of 
blood across the midriff of MARCY CHARLTON'S uniform.

INT.  THE INFIRMARY RECEPTION AREA

THE CAMERA will show us all we need to see, but its movements will 
seem almost random; this is like being in the hotel kitchen after 
Sirhan shot Bobby.

As the students bring in PASCOW, LOUIS comes running, followed by 
STEVE MASTERTON, his P.A. Standing to one side are two student 
nurses in candystriper uniforms. They're boggled and horrified.

LOUIS kneels. THE CAMERA RUSHES FORWARD, shoving between 
onlookers. LOUIS looks at the wound. There's shattered bone and 
pulsing brain tissue beneath.

There's a scream; the girl who was carrying one corner of the 
blanket is having hysterics.

				GIRL
		Vic! Vic! Oh Christ! Vic!

				LOUIS (to CHARLTON)
		Get her out. Get them all out.

CHARLTON puts her arms around the girl.

				GIRL (struggling)
		No! No! He can't die! He can't die!

THE CAMERA MOVES BACK DOWN as LOUIS takes an opthalmascope from 
STEVE and shines it in PASCOW'S bulging, fixed eyes.

CHARLTON is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out 
the door.

				LOUIS
		Steve, get the ambulance over here
		right now. He's got to go to EMMC.

				STEVE
		The ambulance is at Sonny's Sunoco
		downtown, getting--

				LOUIS
		--a new muffler, oh shit--

PASCOW makes a weird gargling noise. Blood suddenly spurts out of 
his mouth. He begins to seizure.

One of the candystripers shrieks. THE CAMERA JERKS UP TO COVER the 
student nurses. One turns and throws up on the wall.

CHARLTON rushes over.

				CANDYSTRIPER
		I can't look at it...I can't stand it...

				CHARLTON (slaps her)
		Yes you by God can. Go get the hard
		stretcher!

As they start away, one helping the other down the hall, and as 
CHARLTON starts over to where PASCOW lies dying on his blanket, 
THE CAMERA DROPS TO LOUIS AND STEVE.

				LOUIS
		Help me hold him.

They hold PASCOW'S spasming body.

				STEVE
		It wouldn't matter if we did have
		the ambulance.

				LOUIS
		It wouldn't matter if we had the SST.

PASCOW begins to quiet.

				LOUIS
		He's going. Steve, go call the motor-
		pool. Marcy, roll out the crash wagon.

				CHARLTON
		It won't--

				LOUIS
		I know it won't! But let's for God's
		sake do it by the rules!

She leaves. LOUIS is alone with PASCOW. CHARLTON has drawn the 
drapes, so the doctor and the dying man have complete if temporary 
privacy.

INT.  LOUIS AND PASCOW, A CLOSER SHOT

				LOIS
		There wasn't even supposed to be a
		sprain today, my friend--that's what
		I told her.

PASCOW'S fixed eyes suddenly roll and his left hand bear-traps 
LOUIS'S right wrist. The dying man pulls him slowly but 
relentlessly down, until their faces are only inches apart.

				PASCOW
		...Pet Sematary...

LOUIS recoils, breaking the grip of the hand...but he cannot quite 
snap the grip of those bright dying eyes. Blood leaks from 
PASCOW'S mouth.

				LOUIS (whispers)
		W-What did you say...?

PASCOW struggles hard to speak again. At first he can only gurgle.

				PASCOW
		It's not the real cemetery...
		(Long pause) The soil of a man's
		heart is stonier, Louis...a man
		grows what he can...and tends it.

LOUIS leans forward again, terrified, yet needing to know.

				LOUIS
		How do you know my name?

				PASCOW (gurgling)
		I'll come...to you.

LOUIS grabs PASCOW'S bloody shoulder.

				LOUIS (low but urgent)
		Dammit, how do you know my name?

INT.  HALLWAY ENTRANCE TO RECEPTION, WITH STEVE

				STEVE
		Louis, they're sending a--

INT.  LOUIS AND PASCOW

PASCOW begins to spasm again.

				LOUIS (snaps)
		Help me!

PASCOW spews more blood as STEVE kneels beside LOUIS.

INT.  THE MAIN INFIRMARY HALLWAY

CHARLTON is pushing along your basic MEDCU goodie-cart, covered 
with emergency life-saving gear.

INT.  LOUIS, STEVE, PASCOW

PASCOW'S spasms are weakening.

				LOUIS (to CHARLTON)
		Never mind. He's going.

PASCOW'S hand comes up and paws at LOUIS'S shirt, leaving a bloody 
handprint. Then it falls limply back. PASCOW is dead.

				LOUIS
		Steve, will you get a sheet to cover
		him with?

STEVE leaves the frame and LOUIS stares fixedly down at the body 
of VICTOR PASCOW. He closes the eyes.

EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, LATE AFTERNOON

It's the leading edge of Maine fall, sunny and wonderful. Here 
comes LOUIS'S station wagon. As it reaches THE CAMERA, it swivels 
to TRACK.

				RADIO (voice-over)
		Tragedy struck on the first day of the
		University of Maine's fall semester 
		when Victor Pascow, a nineteen-year-old
		sophomore--

INT.  THE CAR, WITH LOUIS

He still looks shocked by the tragedy. The dying man's bloody 
handprint is partly visible on LOUIS'S shirt in spite of his 
sport-coat.

LOUIS abruptly turns off the radio and swerves over to the side of 
the road.

EXT.  THE STATION WAGON

IT comes to a slueing, shuddering stop, almost going in the ditch.

INT.  LOUIS, BEHIND THE WHEEL

				LOUIS
		He said my name. I heard it. He
		said my name.

He stares blankly through the windshield.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT

All lights are off. It's late.

INT.  THE CREED BEDROOM  NIGHT

LOUIS and RACHEL are asleep, each on his/her own side of the big 
double. THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON LOUIS.

SOUND: Loud, hollow BANG. It's very loud--loud enough to wake the 
dead.

LOUIS sits up. Beside him, RACHEL sleeps on. LOUIS'S eyes widen in 
terror as he stares at:

INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH PASCOW

He's exquisitely dead. Now pallid as well as smashed up.

				PASCOW
		Come on, doc. We got places to go.

INT.  LOUIS

He is in terror...but he is also in a state of near-trance.

INT.  PASCOW

				PASCOW
		Come on, doc--don't make me tell you
		twice.

INT.  LOUIS

He glances at RACHEL. Although PASCOW has spoken in a fairly loud 
voice--and the opening door was like a bomb--she's still fast 
asleep. LOUIS looks back toward PASCOW...and then gets out of bed. 
He's naked except for a pair of pajama bottoms.

INT.  PASCOW

He turns and leaves the doorway.

INT.  LOUIS

He reaches the bedroom doorway himself and looks back at:

INT.  THE BED, LOUIS'S POV

RACHEL is sleeping as before, and LOUIS himself is also in bed 
asleep, although his rest is uneasy...as if he's having a bad 
dream.

INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH LOUIS

				LOUIS (relieved)
		Oh. Thank God.

				PASCOW (Voice)
		Hurry up, doc.

INT.  THE KITCHEN

LOUIS enters and crosses toward the door which gives on the 
shed/garage. This door stands open. LOUIS pauses by it.

				PASCOW (low)
		Come on, doc...

LOUIS goes into:

INT.  THE SHED/GARAGE

The station wagon is a dark hulk. LOUIS crosses to it and stands, 
perplexed.

PASCOW looms softly behind him and puts an arm around him. LOUIS 
turns... and suddenly his face is less than an inch from PASCOW'S 
mutilated face.

				PASCOW
		Let's go, doc.

				LOUIS (moans)
		I don't like this dream.

				PASCOW
		Who said you were dreaming?

He begins to move toward the garage door. After a moment LOUIS 
follows him.

EXT.  THE FIELD BEHIND THE HOUSE, LONG  NIGHT

We can see two shapes moving up the path toward the woods--PASCOW 
and, behind him, LOUIS.

EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY ARCH

CAMERA HOLDS, THEN PANS DOWN as LOUIS passes under the arch.

EXT.  LOUIS, CLOSE

He looks around, obviously afraid.

EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV

We can see why. By starlight this is one scary place.

EXT.  LOUIS

He suddenly sees something else, and now his fear is close to 
terror.

EXT.  THE DEADFALL, LOUIS'S POV

The face is back in the tumbled branches. It yawns and snarls.

EXT.  LOUIS

He walks toward the deadfall as if hypnotized. PASCOW'S hand falls 
on his shoulder. LOUIS turns, terrified.

EXT.  PASCOW, CLOSE

He really is a dreadful mangled mess.

				PASCOW
		This is the place where the dead speak.

EXT.  LOUIS

He closes his eyes.

				LOUIS
		I want to wake up. I want to wake up,
		that's all. I--

EXT.  LOUIS AND PASCOW

				PASCOW
		The door must not be opened. The
		barrier must not be crossed. Don't
		go on, doc. No matter how much you
		feel you have to. There's more
		power here than you know.

He points at:

EXT.  THE DEADFALL

That grinning face--and perhaps now there are other effects as 
well, subtle but there? Dim red light? A misty smoke drifting 
through the tumbled dead branches? The director will know.

After a moment there is a HUGE GRUNTING ROAR from the woods behind 
the deadfall--it sounds like no animal we've ever heard before. 
There is the sound of something huge shifting and snapping a tree 
like a toothpick.

EXT.  PASCOW AND LOUIS

LOUIS has crumbled to PASCOW'S feet. His eyes are squeezed tightly 
shut.

				LOUIS
		Please, I want to wake up. Leave me 
		alone. It's not my fault you died; you 
		were as good as dead when they brought
		you in--

				PASCOW
		The power of this place is old and
		always restless. Sometimes the dead
		do more than speak. Remember, doc.

CAMERA BEGINS MOVING SLOWLY IN ON LOUIS.

				LOUIS
		Leave me alone!

				PASCOW
		Remember.

CAMERA IS TIGHT ON LOUIS.

				RADIO (voice)
		--another beautiful day in Maine!
		This is Michael O'Hara sayin' that
		the git-go ain't gonna be that bad.
		Temps are going all the way up to 70...
		We got the Ramones for Ludlow...here's
		"Sheena."

As the Ramones start blasting "Sheena Is A Punk Rocker":

INT.  LOUIS, IN BED

His eyes snap open. He's in his own bedroom. As he sits up THE 
CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS OUT so we can see that he's in bed alone; the 
covers on RACHEL'S side are thrown back.

After the initial confusion and fear, LOUIS looks deeply relieved;
he looks the way I suppose we all look upon waking up and 
realizing our worst dreams were only dreams after all.

				RACHEL (calls)
		You up, doc?

				LOUIS
		Getting there.

				RACHEL
		I got eggs down here!

				LOUIS
		Good d--

He throws the covers back and freezes.

INT.  LOUIS'S FEET, LOUIS'S POV

They are covered with mud and pine needles. The sheets are greased 
with woods-muck.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

Utter terror.

INT.  THE LAUNDRY CHUTE, CU

LOUIS'S hands enter the shot and dump a bundle of sheets into the 
chute.

INT.  LOUIS, IN THE UPSTAIRS HALL

He's naked but for a towel around his waist. He's obviously fresh 
from the shower.

He starts down to the bedroom to dress.

BLACK. And on it a third title card: CHURCH.

Over this the SOUND of a RINGING TELEPHONE.

				LOUIS (voice)
		Hello?

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM  AFTERNOON

There's a bowling match on TV. LOUIS, dressed in his Saturday 
afternoon grubs (jeans and a Maine sweatshirt), has the phone to 
his ear.

				JUD CRANDALL (phone filter)
		Louis? 'Fraid you may have a spot of
		trouble.

				LOUIS (frowning)
		Jud? What trouble?

INT.  THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD

He's on the phone, looking out his window.

				JUD
		Did you tell me Rachel took the
		kids back to Chicago for a few days?

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS

				LOUIS
		For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't
		go because her old man thinks I'm a
		shit and the feeling is heartily re-
		ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow
		night. Jud, what's this about?

INT.  THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD

				JUD
		Well, there's a dead cat over here on
		the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it
		might be your daughter's.

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS

				LOUIS
		Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL HOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG

We're looking across from the CREED lawn. LOUIS waits for one of 
those trucks to go blasting by and then crosses. It's cold and 
windy. Downed autumn leaves fly.

LOUIS and JUD stand over a small furry body like mourners.

				JUD (voice)
		Well?

EXT.  THE CAT'S BODY

It's lying on its belly and doesn't look much damaged. Hands--
LOUIS'S--come into the frame. He puts one hand under the cat's 
head and lifts it so the open eyes, now a dull green, stare into 
THE CAMERA. There's some blood on its ruff. That's all.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, ON THE EDGE OF THE CRANDALL LAWN

				LOUIS
		It's Church.

				JUD
		I'm sorry. At least it don't look like
		he suffered.

				LOUIS
		Ellie will, though. She'll suffer plenty.

From his jacket pocket he takes a green plastic garbage bag and 
hands it to JUD. JUD holds the bag's mouth open on the ground 
while LOUIS kind of shoves the body in. During this:

				JUD
		Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?

				LOUIS
		Yes.

LOUIS twists the bag shut and puts one of those plastic ties on 
it. Then he holds it up.

				LOUIS
		Bagged cat. What a mess.

				JUD
		You going to bury him in the Pet
		Sematary?

				LOUIS (a little bitter)
		I guess that's what it's there for, huh?

During all of this JUD has grown peculiarly intense.

				JUD
		Going to tell Ellie?

				LOUIS
		I don't know.

				JUD
		Seems like you told me about a promise
		you made--

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN  MORNING

GAGE is in his high chair. ELLIE, in her first-day-of-school 
dress, is in her place. LOUIS is sitting at his own place staring, 
hypnotized, at the middle of the table, where there is a large 
serving dish. On the dish is scrambled eggs, strips of bacon, and 
CHURCH'S corpse--staring eyes, bloody ruff and all.

				RACHEL (impatiently)
		Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the
		little girl her promise.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL LAWN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS

				LOUIS (defensive)
		That was a mistake. But Rachel...
		she doesn't like to talk about
		death, or even think of it. Her
		younger sister died of spinal
		meningitis when Rachel was eight.
		Rachel was there when it happened.
		Alone. I guess you could say it
		made a complex.

				JUD
		Cat's just as dead, Louis.

				LOUIS (snaps)
		Well that's a big help! (Pause) I'm
		sorry, Jud.

				JUD
		No need to apologize.

				LOUIS
		Maybe when they call I'll just tell
		Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat
		around. You know?

				JUD (after a long pause)
		Maybe there's a better way.

EXT.  THE START OF THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LONG  EVENING

LOUIS and JUD cross the road from the CRANDALL side. LOUIS is 
carrying the plastic bag in one hand and a flashlight in the 
other. JUD has a pick and shovel in one hand and a flashlight of 
his own in the other.

Evening shadows have grown long. It's maybe an hour until dark.

JUD and LOUIS stop near the replaced tire-swing.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

JUD has a Walkman clipped to the belt of his pants and earphones 
slung around his neck.

				LOUIS
		Jud, this is crazy. It's going to
		be almost dark before we get back.

				JUD
		It's going to be dark before we even
		get where we're going, Louis. But
		we can do it...and we're going to.

				LOUIS
		But--

				JUD
		Does she love the cat?

				LOUIS
		Yes, but--

				JUD
		Then come on.

He puts the earphones on, effectively forestalling further 
argument, and pushes the PLAY button on the Walkman. We can hear 
Marshall Crenshaw singing "Crystal Girl." JUD starts away. After a 
moment, LOUIS follows.

EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY AND THE BACK OF THE ARCH  LATE EVENING

The SOUND of crickets...ree-ree-ree...

The SOUND of footfalls.

Faintly, the SOUND of Huey Lewis and the News, singing "Working 
For A Living."

It's now almost twilight.

JUD and LOUIS enter the Pet Sematary. LOUIS is looking around 
curiously.

				LOUIS
		Well, folks, here we are, in Louis
		Creed Dreamland.

JUD snaps off the Walkman and puts the earphones around his neck 
again.

				JUD
		What say, Louis?

				LOUIS
		Nothing. (Pause) Do we plant him on
		the outer circle or start a new one?

				JUD
		We're still not where we're going.

He walks past LOUIS and toward the deadfall. LOUIS follows.

				LOUIS
		What do you mean?

				JUD
		The place we're going is on the
		other side of that.

He points at the deadfall.

				LOUIS
		We can't climb over that. We'll break
		our necks!

				JUD
		No. We won't. I have climbed it a time
		or two before, and I know all the places
		to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't
		look down...and don't stop. If you stop,
		you'll crash through for sure.

				LOUIS
		I'm not climbing that.

				JUD
		Give me the cat. I'll take care of it
		myself.

He holds out his hand and LOUIS sees the old man means exactly as 
he says. After a moment he says:

				LOUIS
		Let's go.

JUD starts up one side of the deadfall, and in spite of its 
snarled tangles, he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of 
stairs. After a few second, LOUIS follows.

				LOUIS (low)
		Thank God my Blue Cross is paid up.

EXT.  THEIR FEET

First JUD'S pass THE CAMERA, then LOUIS'S, partly obscured by the 
swinging cat-bag. Their feet unerringly find the right branches 
and just as unerringly miss holes which look like ankle-breakers.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's grinning, exhilarated.

				LOUIS
		God, this is amazing!

EXT.  JUD

There are beads of sweat on the old man's face. He looks both 
stern and a little scared.

				JUD
		Just don't stop and--

EXT.  LOUIS

He looks down.

EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET

A dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot 
plunges down maybe six inches.

EXT.  LOUIS

He lurches to the edge of balance, then regains it.

				LOUIS
		And don't look down. Right.

He continues.

EXT.  THE DEADFALL, REVERSE  TWILIGHT

JUD reaches the top and starts down the far side. LOUIS reaches 
the top.

EXT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS (amazed)
		Holy...!

EXT.  BIG GOD WOODS, LOUIS'S POV

In the dying glow of twilight, this should be a mystic, awe-
inspiring shot. There's no more scrub underbrush and junk pines 
and juniper-bracken here; ancient firs rise almost like Sequoias. 
The sunset light shafts among them. This is a real forest... an 
old forest. And winding upward among the trees along that needle-
carpeted floor, clearly marked by large white stones, the path 
goes on.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's stopped on top of the deadfall, still surveying all this with 
frank amazement.

EXT.  JUD

				JUD (turns to look)
		Come on, Louis--don't stop!

EXT.  LOUIS, ATOP THE DEADFALL

				LOUIS (grinning)
		I'm all right! I'm f--

EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET

One of the branches snaps. LOUIS'S foot plunges. His cuff rips.

EXT.  LOUIS, JUD'S POV

We're looking up at a fairly steep angle as LOUIS staggers off-
balance. He steps with his other foot, misses, and goes flying.

EXT.  LOUIS, CLOSER

He does a half-somersault in the air and hits the deadfall on his 
back, the green garbage bag flying out of his hand. His flashlight 
also goes. Branches crack. White dust puffs out from under him.

EXT.  JUD, AT THE BASE OF THE DEADFALL

LOUIS thumps to the ground nearby. JUD kneels beside him.

				JUD
		Louis! You all right?

LOUIS sits up groggily. His pants are torn. His sweatshirt is 
torn. His ankle is bleeding.

				LOUIS (dazed)
		Sure. I guess I just lost my happy 
		thoughts for a second there.

LOUIS gets slowly up and retrieves the bag, which is rather 
shredded now--and we can see catfur through some of the rents.

				LOUIS (continues)
		I shouldn't have stopped...and it
		does bite.

He whaps the flashlight against his palm a time or two and the 
light comes on. Satisfied, he shuts it off.

				JUD
		No, you shouldn't have stopped. But
		you got away with it. Important thing
		is are you sure you're all right?

				LOUIS
		Yes. (Pause) Where are we going, Jud?

				JUD
		You'll see before long. Let's go.

He starts off up the path. After a moment LOUIS follows, carrying 
the bag.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, FROM THE DEADFALL

Again, there should be a sense of awe and mystery as they go 
tolling up the path into the twilight, dwarfed by those ancient 
firs.

SOUND OF CRICKETS, LOW at first, then UP TO LOUD: Ree-ree-ree...

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP  TWILIGHT

Lots of undergrowth here, and creeping ground-mist, too. The SOUND 
OF CRICKETS is now only a part of the soundtrack: BUZZ OF CICADAS, 
THUMP OF FROGS. Swamp-sounds.

LOUIS looks frankly doubtful.

				JUD
		This next bit's like the deadfall, Louis--
		you got to walk steady and easy. Just follow
		me and don't look down.

EXT.  LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S AND JUD'S POV  DEEP TWILIGHT

Mysterious...awesome...scary. Dead trees poke out of the murk like 
twisted hands. There's scummy water standing around tussocks 
covered with long grass, most of it dead. There's a lot of choking 
underbrush.

All of this fades away into a grim, obscuring fog.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD

				JUD
		Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.

				LOUIS
		Is there quicksand?

				JUD
		Ayuh.

				LOUIS (nervous; joking)
		Are there ghosts?

JUD looks at him expressionlessly.

				JUD
		Ayuh.

JUD starts off, stepping to the first tussock. After a moment, 
LOUIS follows.

EXT.  JUD, CU

His face is set, strange.

				JUD
		There's a lot of funny things down
		this way, Louis.

EXT.  LOUIS, BEHIND JUD

				LOUIS
		You're telling me.

EXT.  JUD

				JUD (still walking)
		The air's heavier...more electrical...
		something. You might see St. Elmo's
		Fire...what the sailors call 'foo-lights.'
		It makes funny shapes, but it's nothing.

EXT.  LOUIS

HE looks up and his eyes widen as he sees:

EXT.  ANGLE ON LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV

A faintly glowing, ethereal shape hangs in the branches of one of 
the dead trees. It looks a bit like a corpse. In fact, I think it 
looks quite a bit like PASCOW'S corpse.

As we watch it fades...fades...is gone.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's somewhere between being mystified and puzzled and being 
scared. Now a weakly glowing fireball rolls slowly across the 
surface of the standing water toward him...and then just fades 
into the thick mist.

				LOUIS
		It's funny, all right.

EXT.  JUD

				JUD
		Just don't stop, Louis. You don't
		ever want to stop down here in
		Little God. (Pause) And you don't
		ever want to look behind you,
		whatever you hear.

EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS, LONG ANGLE  NIGHT

We see them moving through the mist like wraiths, JUD with his 
digging tools, LOUIS with his light and his Hefty-Bag coffin. The 
whole swamp is glowing dimly.

EXT.  THE FAR SIDE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP  NIGHT

In the extreme f.g. we can see firm ground sloping up. Ahead is a 
thick white mist. And here comes JUD and LOUIS slogging through it 
and out of it. Both of them are wet from the knees down. They head 
into the woods on the far side.

EXT.  A LOW, STONY BLUFF OR STEEP HILL

In the book this is described as being almost a cliff, but a rocky 
hill rising out of the woods would serve just as well. We can see 
steps cut into the side, and two figures--LOUIS and JUD--toiling 
up them.

EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS, A CLOSER SHOT

JUD'S panting and out of breath; LOUIS is, if anything, in worse 
shape.

				JUD
		Almost there, Louis.

				LOUIS
		You keep saying that.

				JUD
		This time I mean it.

He tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars, 
the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow. A few moments 
later LOUIS joins him and stares with undisguised wonder.

EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS AND JUD'S POV

The top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare, but there are a 
number of rocky piles. But for every pile of rocks we can see, 
there are ten littered heaps, as if the neat piles had been burst 
apart. There's a shape to all of this, and it is the shape of the 
Pet Sematary: concentric circles.

SOUND: The wind, blowing ceaselessly.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, AT THE EDGE OF THE BURYING GROUND

				LOUIS (awed)
		What is this place?

				JUD
		This was their burying ground, Louis.

				LOUIS
		Whose burying ground?

				JUD
		The Micmac Indians. I brought you here
		to bury Ellen's cat.

				LOUIS
		Why? For God's sake, why?

				JUD
		I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later.
		All right?

				LOUIS
		I guess so...but...

				JUD
		You want to rest a bit before you start?

				LOUIS
		No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to
		dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.

				JUD
		Soil's thin, all right. But you'll manage.

He hands him the pick and shovel.

				JUD
		I'm going to sit over yonder and have a
		smoke. I'd help you, but you've got to
		do it yourself. Each buries his own.
		That's how it was done then.

JUD walks away, leaving LOUIS with the digging tools in one hand 
and the flashlight in the other. After a minute, LOUIS walks out 
into the burying ground.

EXT.  LOOKING DOWN INTO A SHALLOW HOLE  NIGHT

SOUND: The wind. It blows ceaselessly up here.

The hole's about two and a half feet deep. Stubby rocks protrude 
from the sides. The pick comes down, hits a rock at the bottom, 
and flashes fire.

EXT.  LOUIS

He drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits. Beside 
him we see a low pile of rocks and earth.

				JUD (voice)
		Should be deep enough.

He joins LOUIS. He's got a lot of rocks in his arms.

				LOUIS
		You think so?

He notices the rocks.

				LOUIS
		What are those for?

				JUD
		Your cairn.

EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, LOUIS'S POV

Those tumbled piles of rock are very obvious.

EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD, BY CHURCH'S GRAVE

				LOUIS
		Doesn't look like they last long.

				JUD
		Don't worry about that.

				LOUIS
		Jud, why am I doing all this?

				JUD
		Because it's right.

He walks off again.

LOUIS looks after him for a moment, then kneels down.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY THE GARBAGE BAG

He opens it and looks in at CHURCH'S stiffening corpse.

				LOUIS
		Pax vobiscum, Church old buddy. You
		were a hell of a god cat. I doubt if
		you were worth all this aggravation,
		but you were a hell of a good cat.

He tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave, and then 
begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade.

EXT.  THE CAIRN, CU  NIGHT

LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and add a final two or three 
stones.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY THE CAIRN

He looks at it for a moment and stands up. JUD is right there.

				JUD
		That's fine. You did real good.

LOUIS looks at him.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT

There's a light on in the kitchen, but that's all. There's silence 
at first, and then the PHONE STARTS RINGING.

EXT.  LOUIS'S FIELD  NIGHT

LOUIS and JUD are coming down the path with their tools and their 
lights. They are both clearly fagged out.

SOUND, FAINT: The telephone.

				LOUIS
		Oh, shit! Rachel!

He drops the tools and sprints.

EXT.  THE CREED'S SIDE YARD, BY THE TIRE SWING

LOUIS runs into the side yard. SOUND of the phone is louder.

EXT.  THE KITCHEN DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS

He runs to the door and inside.

EXT.  THE END OF THE PATH, WITH JUD

He stands there, eyes inscrutable.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE

It stops. A beat later LOUIS enters the room. He picks it up, 
although he already knows it's too late. He listens to the SOUND 
of the dial tone and then drops it back into the cradle, 
disgusted.

He starts to dial a number from memory.

				JUD (voice)
		Louis.

INT.  THE KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH JUD

				JUD
		When you talk to 'em, not one word
		about what we done tonight. 'S'far's
		you know, the cat's still fine.

INT.  LOUIS, BY THE PHONE

After a moment he lowers it into the cradle.

INT.  JUD

				JUD
		You'll understand. In the meantime,
		keep your peace. What we did, Louis,
		was a secret thing. Women are supposed
		to be the ones who are good at
		keeping secrets, but any woman who
		knows anything at all would tell you
		she's never seen into a man's heart.
		The soil of a man's heart is stonier,
		Louis--like the soil up there in the
		old Micmac burying ground. A man
		grows what he can...and tends it.

During this, he's come across the room to LOUIS and dropped his 
hand on LOUIS'S shoulder.

				LOUIS
		But--

				JUD
		No buts! Accept what's done, Louis.
		What we done was right. Another time
		it might not be, but tonight it was...
		at least I hope to Christ it was. Now
		you make your call...but not a word
		about tonight.

EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH JUD

SOUNDS: Boops and beeps of a touch-tone telephone. Ringing. Then:

				DORY GOLDMAN (voice)
		Goldman residence.

				LOUIS
		Hi, Dory...it's Louis--

During this, another SOUND has been growing: an approaching truck. 
As JUD gains his side of the road, he looks back, and we read fear 
on his face--no matter what he said to LOUIS, he's sorry for 
tonight's piece of work.

A moment later a highballing Orinco truck cuts between THE CAMERA 
and JUD.

INT.  LOUIS, IN THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

He's on the phone, smiling and happy.

				RACHEL (voice)
		You want to talk to the birthday girl?

				LOUIS
		That'd be real fine.

				ELLIE (voice)
		Hi...daddy?

				LOUIS (sings)
		Happy birthday to you/Happy birthday
		to you/Happy birthday, dear Ellie/Happy
		birthday to you!

				ELLIE (voice)
		That was awful, daddy.

				LOUIS
		Yeah, I know...how are things out 
		there in Chicagoland?

				ELLIE
		Fine...except when Mom was airing
		Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and
		got into Grampa's study and pooped in
		Grampa's favorite chair.

				LOUIS (grinning broadly)
		Way to go, Gage!

				ELLIE (voice)
		What?

				LOUIS
		I said that's too bad. What did you
		get for presents from Gramma and Grampa?

				ELLIE (voice)
		Lots of stuff! I got two dresses...and
		a Chatty Cathy doll...

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE

She's dressed for bed, in fuzzy pink pajamas. Her Chatty Cathy is 
crooked in one arm. In her lap is a Garfield transistor radio.

				ELLIE
		...and a Garfield radio! How's Church,
		dad? Does he miss me?

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS

The smile fades off his face. It's replaced with a look of 
combined guilt and unhappiness. He's looking at his hands, which 
are still dark with the dirt from CHURCH'S grave.

				LOUIS
		Well...I guess he's just fine, Ellie.
		I haven't seen him this evening, but--

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH ELLIE

RACHEL, holding GAGE, sits on the arm of ELLIE'S chair.

				ELLIE
		Well, make sure you put him down
		cellar before you go to bed so he
		can't run out in the road and get
		greased. And kiss him goodnight for me.

				LOUIS (voice)
		Yuck! Kiss your own cat!

				ELLIE
		Want to talk to Gage?

Before he can answer, she puts the phone in GAGE'S hand. ELLIE and 
RACHEL watch, amused, as GAGE gobbles into it. Perhaps RACHEL 
encourages him to say a few words.

INT.  THE CREED LVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS

From the telephone comes the sound of GAGE talking and chortling. 
LOUIS is not listening. His eyes--and his mind--are far away.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING

LOUIS is raking leaves on the side lawn, near the tree with the 
tire swing. After a moment or two of this he props the rake 
against the tree and starts toward the garage. He goes in.

EXT.  THE GARAGE, WITH LOUIS

It's dim in here. LOUIS is crossing to the door which communicates 
to the kitchen. As he passes the station wagon, he hears a cat 
HISS. He turns.

INT.  CHURCH, ECU

He's on top of the car, but at this point we probably don't 
notice; THE CAMERA is so close that CHURCH looks like he's coming 
right down our throats. He's hissing angrily.

INT.  LOUIS

He recoils and stumbles backward with a cry. He hits a tool-rack 
on the wall and a lot of them fall down with a LOUD JANGLING 
NOISE.

INT.  ON TOP OF THE STATION WAGON, WITH CHURCH

He jumps down, frightened by the noise, and the CAMERA TRACKS as 
he goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight.

INT.  LOUIS

He gets slowly to his feet again. He's getting over his fright but 
we can see he's totally freaked out by what gave him that fright. 
He goes to the garage door and looks out.

				LOUIS (calls)
		Church?

EXT.  THE SIDE YARD, LOUIS'S POV

Grass and fallen leaves. No sign of CHURCH.

EXT.  LOUIS'S STUNNED FACE, CU

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS

He's spooning cat-food into a dish. He goes to the door--there 
should be a total of three doors in the kitchen: one to the living 
room, one to the shed/garage, and one which leads directly 
outside. LOUIS uses this latter door now.

EXT.  THE KITCHEN STOOP, WITH LOUIS

He puts the dish of food down and sits beside it.

				LOUIS
		Food, Church...food!

SOUND: Miaow.

EXT.  THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, LOUIS'S POV

CHURCH comes slinking out of the bushes and comes slowly toward 
THE CAMERA. He stops, looking mistrustful.

EXT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS
		Come on, Church! Chow down!

EXT.  CHURCH

He crosses to the stoop and begins eating the food.

				LOUIS (to himself)
		Christ. I don't believe this.

He picks CHURCH up. CHURCH miaows again--he wants the food.

				LOUIS (wincing)
		God, you stink, Church.

CHURCH is looking at the food, trying to get out of LOUIS'S arms.

				LOUIS
		In a second.

He tilts the cat's head back so he can get a look at CHURCH'S 
neck.

EXT.  CHURCH'S NECK, CU (LOUIS'S POV)

There's some sort of mark here--a clear remnant	of the crash. A 
line of white fur, or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all 
grows.

EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH, ON THE STOOP

LOUIS sees something else as he lets the cat's neck go. He tweezes 
something out of CHURCH'S whiskers.

EXT.  LOUIS'S HAND, ECU

It's a shred of green plastic.

EXT.  LOUIS AND CHURCH

				LOUIS
		Chewed his way out. Jesus Baldheaded
		Christ, he ch--

CHURCH suddenly claws at his face.

				LOUIS
		Ow!

He claps his hand to his face. CHURCH leaps for the food. LOUIS 
slowly takes his hand away. There are claw marks on his cheek, 
welling blood. He looks at the cat.

EXT.  JUD CRANDALL'S GARDEN, WITH JUD

The garden is a plot of about half an acre. JUD comes trundling 
slowly along a row, pushing a wheelbarrow. There are several 
pumpkins in it. JUD is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a 
Ramones sweatshirt. He's wearing his headphones and we can hear 
the Romantics doing "What I Like About You." JUD is singing along 
and bopping a little--as much as his arthritis will allow, if you 
can dig it.

He sees a real big pumpkin, stops, and bends over to get it.

He takes out his pocket-knife and slits the pumpkin-vine. He gets 
the pumpkin in his arms and stands up. He turns...and LOUIS is 
right there (kind of a cheap jump, but always fun), looking 
totally stunned.

JUD, startled, drops the pumpkin. LOUIS reaches out and slides the 
phones off JUD'S ears.

				LOUIS
		What did we do?

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN

LOUIS is sitting at the kitchen table. JUD is at the fridge. JUD 
comes back with a couple of long-necked bottles of beer and opens 
them.

				JUD
		I most generally don't start before
		noon, but this looks like an exception.

				LOUIS
		What did we do, Jud?

				JUD
		Why, saved a little girl from being
		unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!

LOUIS drinks about half the beer.

				LOUIS
		I tried to tell myself I buried him
		alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets
		Felix the Cat. But...

				JUD
		Wouldn't wash?

				LOUIS
		No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I
		see it, and Church was dead. He smells
		horrible and he uses his claws, but
		he's alive...and I feel like I'm going
		crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?

				JUD
		Ayuh. It was the rag-man told me about
		the place--Stanley Bouchard. Us kids
		just called him Stanny B. He was half
		Micmac himself.

LOUIS drains his beer.

				LOUIS
		Can I have another one?

				JUD
		I guess it wouldn't hurt.

He gets up and goes to the fridge.

INT.  JUD, AT THE FRIDGE

				JUD
		The Micmacs used to bury their dead
		up there long before the whites came.

He returns to the table with the beer.

				JUD
		They buried their dead and for a long
		time their dead stayed buried. Then
		something happened. Half the tribe died
		in a season. The rest moved on. They
		said a Wendigo had soured the ground.

				LOUIS
		Wendigo?

				JUD
		Spirit of the north country. Not a good
		spirit. Wendigos are great liars and
		tricksters, according to the stories. 
		And if one touches you...

JUD pauses, perhaps a flustered, and gathers his thoughts.

				JUD
		Maybe it really was a Wendigo--
		I ain't the one to say it wasn't--
		or maybe it was just some disease.
		Whatever the reason, those that were
		left moved on. But they left that
		place...the way it is now.

JUD shrugs, and drinks.

EXT.  JUD AS A BOY, CU/SEPIA TONE  DAY

The time here is about 1910. JUD is wearing short pants. He's 
crying, not in any big-deal histrionic way, but as if he means to 
keep doing it for a long time. I mean he looks really sad.

				JUD (voice)
		I loved my dog a lot, Louis. When Spot
		died, I thought I was gonna die.

JUD is sitting on the front stoop. It's the same house JUD lives 
in now, but the porch hasn't been added yet, and the road is dirt 
rather than tar.

Along this road comes a horse-drawn wagon--STANNY B.'S wagon. The 
wagon's full of junk, rags, bottles...stuff to sell and swap. 
Strung across the top are bells, and we can hear their CHIMING 
SOUND...but faint, like bells heard in a dream.

STANNY B. is old and drunk. Dust spumes up behind the wagon as he 
draws up to the CRANDALL house and stops. He gets down, almost 
falls, takes a bottle out of his back pocket, drinks, and 
approaches JUD. We can see him speaking.

INT.  JUD'S KITCHEN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS

				LOUIS
		You and this old Indian rag-man--

				JUD
		Stanny B. did for me what I did for
		you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't
		alone when Spot came back.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL BACK YARD/SEPIA TONE  DAY

JUD'S MOTHER is back to THE CAMERA, hanging sheets on the line. 
The sheets billow. And suddenly, pushing out from behind them, 
quite near her, is a small mongrel dog. SPOT. He's covered with 
graveyard dirt. His eyes are red and rolling. He splashes the 
sheets with the muck of his passage.

				JUD (voice)
		My mother was with me.

She sees who it is--what it is--and backs away, screaming, 
horrified.

EXT.  SPOT, CLOSER/SEPIA

				JUD (voice)
		He'd got caught in bobwire that infected.
		You could still see the marks on him.

And so we can, around his neck and along the side of his head. 
These marks are the counterpart of the marks we've already seen on 
CHURCH.

SOUND of JUD'S MOM SCREAMING. Like the bells, these are screams 
heard in a dream.

EXT.  THE BACK STOOP OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE/SEPIA

The BOY JUD comes running out, dressed in a night-shirt.

EXT.  JUD'S MOM/SEPIA (JUD'S POV)

She's cringing against the fence at the rear of the yard. SPOT 
stands in front of her, swaying from side to side, as if doped.

				JUD'S MOM (dim; far)
		Get your dog, Jud! He stinks of the
		ground you buried him in! Come here
		and get your dog!

She is in utter terror.

EXT.  THE BOY JUD/SEPIA

Horrified...ashamed.

EXT.  JUD'S MOM/SEPIA

				JUD'S MOM (terror)
		COME AND GET YOUR DOG!!

INT.  JUD AND LOUIS, IN JUD'S KITCHEN

				LOUIS
		How did your mother take it, Jud?
		How did she take it when your dog
		came back from the dead?

JUD'S face is a complication. He's lying to LOUIS, certainly--but 
is he also lying to himself? Yes, I think so.

				JUD
		Well, she was a little upset at first,
		and that's why I thought you ought to
		hold your peace when you talked to
		your people last night...you did, didn't
		you, Louis?

				LOUIS
		Yes.

				JUD
		Why, then, things should be fine.

				LOUIS
		A little upset is all she was? Because
		I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a
		little like a nuclear reactor on the
		edge of a meltdown.

				JUD
		She got used to the idea. Spot lived
		another four years. He died peacefully
		in the night that second time, and I
		buried him in the Pet Sematary...where
		his bones still lie.

EXT.  THE ROAD BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES, WITH LOUIS AND JUD

We see them crossing.

				LOUIS (voice)
		You still haven't told me why you
		did it.

EXT.  JUD AND LOUIS, ON THE CREED FRONT LAWN

				JUD
		A man doesn't always know why he does
		things, Louis. I think I did it because
		your daughter ain't ready for her
		favorite pet to die.

				LOUIS
		What?

				JUD
		Ellie's a little scared of death. And
		the main reason Ellie's that way is
		because your wife is a lot scared of
		death. Now you just go ahead and tell
		me I'm wrong.

But LOUIS'S reaction tells him he's not wrong--in fact, JUD has 
hit the nail right on the head.

INT.  BATHTUB FIXTURES, CU

LOUIS'S hands come into the frame and turn the spigots.

INT.  THE BATHROOM, WITH LOUIS

He starts to undress, still looking troubled. We should notice 
that the door behind him is firmly shut. The bathroom has no 
windows.

INT.  THE BATHTUB SPIGOTS

The hot water is steaming. LOUIS'S hands enter the frame and turn 
off the faucets. SOUND of LOUIS climbing in.

INT.  LOUIS IN THE TUB

A big sigh and an expression of exquisite pleasure. He relaxes in 
the hot water. After a few moments he puts a wet washcloth over 
his face.

INT.  BY THE KITCHEN SINK, WITH RACHEL

				RACHEL
		Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give
		the little girl her promise.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE

GAGE is in his high chair. ELLIE is at her place, crying. In 
RACHEL'S place sits VICTOR PASCOW, bloody and wrecked. LOUIS sits 
in his place. On the platter of bacon and scrambled eggs is 
CHURCH'S mangled body.

				PASCOW
		The door must not be opened. The
		barrier must not be crossed.

				LOUIS
		You don't understand--

INT.  THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS

The washrag is slipping, but it still covers his face.

				LOUIS (mutters)
		--I'm a doctor.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE

In attendance: PASCOW, LOUIS, ELLIE, GAGE in his high chair. Lying 
in the middle of the table, clotted with dirt and blood, eyes 
staring, neck a gory mess of infected wounds, is SPOT. He's also 
dotted with clots of scrambled egg and bits of bacon.

				PASCOW
		Sometimes the dead do more than speak.
		Remember, doc.

INT.  RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN SINK

				RACHEL (with great force)
		Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Promise me.
		Promise me. Promise me.

INT.  THE BATHTUB, WITH LOUIS

The washcloth has slipped enough so we can see his eyes are 
closed--he's dozing.

				LOUIS
		Promise...

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN TABLE

To LOUIS, ELLIE, PASCOW, GAGE, and the corpse of SPOT enters JUD, 
his eyes shocked and staring.

				JUD (to LOUIS)
		You do it for all the best reasons,
		but that ain't why. You do it because
		it gets hold of you...you do it
		because you have to.

INT.  LOUIS, IN THE BATHTUB, CU

The washrag has worked its way down to his mouth by now. His doze 
is deepening; he's started to snore a little.

SOUND: A splash. Something has been dropped into the bath.

LOUIS opens his eyes. Looks puzzled. Looks down. Eyes widen in 
shock.

INT.  THE BATHWATER, LOUIS'S POV

A very large and very mangled dead rat floats in the bath, 
actually brushing against LOUIS'S chest. Blood has begun to stain 
the water.

INT.  LOUIS

Turns his head, preparatory to leaping out.

INT.  THE TOILET LID, WITH CHURCH

Its mouth yawns open. It hisses, showing bloodstained teeth.

INT.  THE BATHROOM

LOUIS leaps from the tub. Grabs a towel and begins to rub himself 
frantically. He's grossed out. The cat tries to arch against him 
and he hits it. CHURCH falls to the floor, hissing.

LOUIS looks at the closed door.

				LOUIS
		How the hell did you get in?

He may not know that, but he knows how it's going to get out. He 
opens the door to the upstairs hall. If CHURCH doesn't go at once, 
LOUIS helps it with his foot.

Then he looks down at:

INT.  THE BATHTUB WITH BRER RAT, LOUIS'S POV

INT.  LOUIS

Staring at the rat. Over this: THE SOUND OF JET ENGINES.

EXT.  A DELTA 727

Its landing gear unfolds preparatory to touching down at Bangor 
International Airport.

INT.  A DEPLANING AREA  DAY

Lots of people making their way up the jetway.

INT.  LOUIS, OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT

He's looking anxiously for his people. In one hand he's got half a 
dozen roses. His face lights up.

INT.  THE DEPLANING AREA, LOUIS'S POV

Here comes LOUIS'S family. ELLIE is a little ahead. RACHEL is 
pushing GAGE in his stroller. ELLIE sees LOUIS and lights up.

				ELLIE
		Daddy!

She runs for him.

INT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE SECURITY POINT

ELLIE comes belting up to LOUIS, weaving among the deplanees like 
a slalom skier. She leaps into his arms. LOUIS swings her 
cheerfully.

				LOUIS
		Hi, sugar!

She smacks him noisily. He smacks her back just as noisily.

				ELLIE
		Daddy, is Church all right?

LOUIS'S face changes. All at once he's watchful.

				LOUIS
		Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping
		on the front porch when I left.

				ELLIE
		Cause I had a bad dream about him.
		I dreamed he got hit by a car and
		you and Mr. Crandall buried him in
		the Pet Sematary.

				LOUIS (trying to smile)
		That was a silly dream, wasn't it?

				ELLIE
		Is he really all right?

				LOUIS
		Yes.

				ELLIE
		Because you promised.

				LOUIS
		I know.

RACHEL reaches them. She's pretty tired. Hair hanging in her face, 
good travelling clothes now looking a bit wrinkled and a bit 
stale.

				RACHEL
		Want to take your son, doc?

LOUIS does. GAGE is ecstatic.

LOUIS kisses RACHEL deeply.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, NIGHT

CHURCH at the door, waiting to be let out. ELLIE does the honors. 
CHURCH oils out into the shed/garage. ELLIE closes the door. She 
looks distressed. She crosses the kitchen again.

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM, NIGHT

RACHEL, in a flannel nightgown, is watching TV. LOUIS is reading a 
medical tome and making notes. GAGE, zipped into a warm blanket 
suit, is sacking on the couch.

				ELLIE (entering)
		Can cats have shampoos?

				RACHEL
		Yes--you have to take them to someone
		who grooms animals, though. I think
		it's pretty expensive.

				ELLIE (still upset)
		I don't care. I'll save up my allowance
		and pay for it. Church smells bad.

				LOUIS
		I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up
		the money, Ellen.

				ELLIE
		I hate that smell.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

He looks both grim and sad--a man discovering that what you pay 
for you own, and what you own always comes home to you.

				LOUIS
		Yes--I hate it, too.

BLACK. And on it, a fourth title card: MISSY DANDRIDGE.

SOUND: A pen scratching over paper.

INT.  A STUDY DESK, CU

A single sheet of lined paper is spotlighted by the glow of the 
desk-lamp. On it, MISSY'S right hand is just finishing: "Dr. says 
Intestinal Cancer. Cannot face this Pain. Sorry."

The hand puts the pen down. It tears the paper in two, leaving 
just the half with the message.

INT.  THE DANDRIDGE CELLAR, NIGHT

A light comes on and we see a hangman's noose strung over a beam. 
It dangles above a kitchen table which has been relegated to 
cellar duty.

SOUND: Descending footsteps.

INT.  THE NOOSE, CU

SOUND of MISSY climbing onto the table.

Her face enters the frame. She looks very sick. She puts her head 
into the noose and rakes it tight at the hyoid bone.

EXT.  THE DANDRIDGE HOUSE, NIGHT

One light on...a cellar light.

SOUND: Ree-ree-ree...then...

SOUND: Kick! THUMP!

SOUND: Ree-ree-ree...

INT.  THE CELLAR, WITH MISSY DANDRIDGE

She hangs limply, hands dangling at her sides, above the table, 
which now lies upon its side. We can see the note clearly. She 
pinned it to the bodice of her housedress.

SOUND: Car engines starting up.

EXT.  IN FRONT OF THE GRACE METHODIST CHURCH  DAY

People are coming out and getting into their cars and turning on 
the headlights, even though it is only mid-morning.

In the immediate f.g. is a hearse. Four pallbearers are loading a 
coffin into it.

EXT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE, ON THE CHURCH STEPS

				ELLIE
		They're all turning on their lights!
		Daddy, why are they all turning on
		their lights in the middle of the day?

JUD, dressed in a rusty old black suit and a black tie, comes out 
and stands with them. He looks haggard and old.

				JUD
		They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.

				ELLIE
		Is that right, dad?

				LOUIS
		Yes. To honor the dead.

EXT.  THE CHURCH PARKING AREA

More cars start up; more lights come on; the back doors of the 
hearse swing closed.

EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETARY  DAY

[NOTE: In the book LOUIS finds it difficult to enter at night 
because of a high iron fence. Here we should see there's no such 
problem; there's only a low stone wall between the graveyard and 
the public road.]

The mourners are of course gathered around the grave of MISSY 
DANDRIDGE. The coffin rests above it on runners.

				MINISTER (voice)
		May the Lord bless you and keep you;
		may the Lord make his face to shine
		upon you, and comfort you, and lift
		you up, and give you peace. Amen.

EXT.  LOUIS, ELLIE, JUD

As the mourners begin to break up, these three start back toward 
LOUIS'S car.

				JUD
		Rachel not feeling well?

				LOUIS
		Well...a touch of the flu...

				ELLIE
		She's in bed. She was throwing up.
		Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said
		Missy--

				LOUIS
		That's enough, Ellen.

They've reached the CREED station wagon.

				JUD
		Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.

				LOUIS
		This babe has said enough.

He opens the front passenger door.

				LOUIS
		Hop in, Ellie.

She does, and LOUIS closes the door.

				JUD
		Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to
		hear. I remember when she was
		no older'n Ellen there, walking down
		to the store with her Raggedy Anne
		doll draggin' behind her in the dust.
		I don't know why God takes someone
		like her, who should have a bunch of
		years still in front of them, and lets
		an old shit like me just go on and on.

				LOUIS
		My father used to have a saying, Jud--
		"God sees the truth, but waits."

				JUD
		Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?

				LOUIS
		It's Ellie's cat.

				JUD
		Nope. He's your cat now.

JUD opens one of the back doors as LOUIS goes around to the 
driver's side.

INT.  THE BACK SEAT OF THE WAGON

JUD has tilted over in one corner and is snoring. His Walkman 
'phones are on and we can hear the tinny sounds of Billy Idol. A 
little old man's drool trickles down from one corner of his mouth.

SOUND: ELLEN< crying.

INT.  THE FRONT OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS AND ELLIE

Tears are spilling freely down ELLIE'S face.

				LOUIS
		Ellie? What's wrong?

				ELLIE
		No more chocolate chip cookies.

				LOUIS
		Huh?

				ELLIE
		Missy made the best chocolate chip
		cookies in the world--even Mom said
		so. Now there won't be any more
		because she's gonna be dead forever!

She cries harder. LOUIS reaches out and strokes her hair.

EXT.  THE STATION WAGON, DAY

Moving up the country road toward home through blazing fall 
foliage.

INT.  TV SCREEN, CU  NIGHT

On it is a scene from "Night of the Living Dead."

				NEWSCASTER
		Bizarre as it may seem, it now seems
		almost beyond doubt: the dead are
		returning to eat the living.

				ELLIE (voice)
		Daddy?

INT.  THE CREED LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

There's a VCR on top of the TV; LOUIS has been watching "Night." 
Now he quickly uses the remote control to shut down the TV.

She's dressed for bed, and comes toward him slowly.

				LOUIS
		What's up, sugar?

				ELLIE
		Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge
		went to heaven?

				LOUIS

		What?

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH RACHEL

She's putting away the last of the supper things. She hears this 
and moves toward the living room door to listen. She doesn't look 
at all well. Her eyes are red from crying and her face is haggard.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH LOUIS AND ELLIE

She's gotten up into his lap.

				ELLIE
		At school Michael McDowell said she was
		gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says
		all sewersides fry in hell.

				LOUIS
		Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full
		of shit he probably squeaks when he walks,
		my dear.

INT.  RACHEL, AT THE DOOR

She smiles a little at this.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE, IN THE LIVING ROOM

				LOUIS
		But don't you dare say that.

				ELLIE
		I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you
		think?

				LOUIS
		I don't know, honey. Different people
		believe all sorts of different things
		happen to us when we die. Some believe
		in heaven or hell. Some think we're
		born again as little children--

				ELLIE
		Sure, carnation. Like in that movie
		you rented, Audrey Rose.

				LOUIS
		Well, it's actually reincarnation, but
		you get the idea. And some people think
		we just wink out...like a candle flame
		when the wind blows hard.

				ELLIE
		Do you believe that?

LOUIS looks toward:

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM SOFA, WITH CHURCH, LOUIS'S POV

CHURCH is sleeping.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

				LOUIS
		I think we go on. I'm not sure
		what happens after we die, but yeah--
		I have faith in that.

				ELLIE
		You believe in it.

				LOUIS
		Oh, faith's a little more than just
		believing.

INT.  RACHEL, AT THE KITCHEN DOOR

Listening intently.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

				LOUIS (continues)
		I'll tell you what faith is--it's the
		evidence of the heart; the assurance
		of things not seen.

				ELLIE
		I don't get it.

				LOUIS
		Well, here we are, sitting in my
		chair. Do you think my chair will
		be here tomorrow?

				ELLIE
		Yeah, sure.

				LOUIS
		Then you have faith in that. But
		we don't know it will be; after all,
		some crazed chair-burglar might break
		in while we're away and steal it, right?

ELLIE'S giggling.

INT.  RACHEL, AT THE DOOR

She's smiling, too...but tears are running down her cheeks.

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

				LOUIS
		But we plan on that chair. We believe
		in that chair. And I plan on going on
		somehow as Louis Creed, after I die.
		I believe I will.

				ELLIE (awed)
		You have faith in that.

				LOUIS
		Yes ma'am. Just like I have faith that
		it is now time for Ellen Creed to get
		ready for bed. So buzz.

He gets her off his lap.

				ELLIE
		I'm not tired!

				LOUIS
		I'm sure you're not.

				ELLIE
		Then why do I have to go to bed?

				LOUIS
		Because your mother and I need
		the rest, sugar. Now buzz.

She heads toward the stairs.

INT.  LOUIS AND RACHEL'S BEDROOM

LOUIS is in bed, reading. RACHEL, wearing a robe over her 
nightgown, comes in.

				RACHEL
		I heard you tonight.

				LOUIS
		I thought maybe you did. I know
		you don't approve of the subject
		being raised--

				RACHEL
		That's not true. The subject
		scares me. Because of Zelda.

LOUIS puts his book down and looks at her thoughtfully.

				LOUIS
		Your sister, I know.

RACHEL sits down on the end of the bed. She's clasping her hands 
nervously together.

				RACHEL
		Sometimes you're so good with her,
		Louis--so straight with her--that
		you make me ashamed of myself.

LOUIS sits up and scoots down the bed to her. He tries to put an 
arm around her. She rejects it--but gently.

				RACHEL
		I'm sorry I couldn't go with you
		to Missy's funeral. And that I
		blew up when we went to that
		silly animal graveyard.

				LOUIS
		That's forgotten.

				RACHEL
		Not by me, it isn't. I know how
		badly I acted, how unfair I was.
		It's just that I..you know.

				LOUIS
		Yes, I guess I do.

He makes a place for her beside him and hugs her. They lie 
silently together for awhile, taking comfort from each other.

				RACHEL
		I'm going to try to do better.

				LOUIS
		You're doing fine.

							DISSOLVE TO:

BLACK. And on it, a fifth title card: GAGE.

SOUND: An idling truck motor.

EXT.  THE GRILLE OF A TRUCK  DAY

It looks monstrous...as high as a mountain.

EXT.  THE TRUCK, A NEW ANGLE

It's an Orinco tanker. The driver, a young man in khaki fatigues 
and a baseball cap, climbs up into the cab. He slams the door and 
jams the truck into gear.

				IRWIN GOLDMAN (voice)
		I knew something like this would happen.

EXT.  THE ORINCO SHIPPING YARD  DAY

The truck comes rolling slowly toward the main gate...stops so the 
driver can look both ways...and then pulls slowly out onto ROUTE 
9.

				IRWIN (voice continues)
		I told her when you were first married.
		'You'll have all the grief you can stand,
		and more,' I said.

INT.  A FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH IRWIN GOLDMAN AND LOUIS  DAY

There are others here, but they are in the b.g., and concentrating 
on the scene the old man is making. He's RACHEL'S dad. LOUIS is 
sitting in the aisle seat of a pew-like bench. He looks terribly 
shattered--they both do, actually. He's staring at the old man as 
if he cannot in the least comprehend what he's saying.

				IRWIN (continues)
		And now look at this!

He gestures toward:

INT.  THE FRONT OF THE FUNERAL CHAPEL  DAY

Here, half-buried in floral tributes, is a child-sized coffin. 
GAGE'S.

INT.  IRWIN AND LOUIS  DAY

				IRWIN (weeping)
		Run over in the road like a...a
		chipmunk!

EXT.  ROUTE 9, W/TRUCK  DAY

Getting up to speed.

EXT.  A KITE, CU

There's a hand holding it--LOUIS'S. The kite begins to move and 
THE CAMERA TRACKS IT. It flaps and flutters.

EXT.  THE FIELD BESIDE THE CREED HOUSE, WITH LOUIS

He runs with the kite beneath a gorgeous fall sky in which fat 
clouds move like airy ocean liners.

				ELLIE (voice)
		Go, daddy!

EXT.  A PICNIC TABLE  DAY

The remains of a picnic lunch are spread here. Looks like everyone 
ate well. In attendance: RACHEL, ELLIE, GAGE, and JUD CRANDALL.

				GAGE
		Go, dayee!

They all laugh--JUD ruffles the kid's hair.

EXT.  LOUIS, RUNNING WITH THE KITE

He's paying out string--and the kite is going up.

				LOUIS (voice)
		Where's Rachel?

INT.  THE FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH LOUIS AND IRWIN

IRWIN looks toward:

INT.  THE BACK OF THE CHAPEL, WITH RACHEL AND DORY GOLDMAN

They are by the sign-in book. Both are dressed in black. Both look 
haggard. But RACHEL looks more than haggard; she looks damned near 
insane with grief and horror.

INT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN

				IRWIN (leaning forward)
		With her mother! Where she should be!
		As for you, I hope you rot in hell!
		In hell, do you hear me?

We should; by now he's screaming his head off.

INT.  THE CAB OF THE ORINCO TRUCK  DAY

The driver is whistling. A transistor radio hangs from the rear-
view mirror on a strap. He turns it on. The Ramones. "Sheena." 
Hey-ho, let's go.

EXT.  ROUTE 9, TRUCKER'S POV

Unrolling before us at a good clip--too good, maybe.

INT.  THE TUCKER'S FOOT

Stamping the pedal closer to the metal.

EXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK

Belting toward THE CAMERA. SOUND of the GROWLING ENGINE.

EXT.  THE SKY, WITH THE KITE

LOUIS has clearly gotten it up okay.

EXT.  LOUIS, IN THE FIELD

He's holding the string, looking up at the sky. Now he looks back 
at the picnic table.

				LOUIS
		Hey, Gage!

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE

GAGE gets down and runs toward his father.

EXT.  ROUTE 9 WITH THE ORINCO TANKER

Belting along fast. SOUND of the Ramones.

EXT.  THE FIELD, WITH LOUIS AND GAGE

GAGE runs to his dad, chubby legs working. He reaches him, and 
LOUIS transfers thee ball of string to GAGE'S hands.

				GAGE
		Dat?

				LOUIS
		String! You're flying it,
		Gage--you got the hammer, my man!

				GAGE
		Gage fline it?

				LOUIS
		Bet your boots. Look--

LOUIS puts his hands over GAGE'S hands and pulls them down.

EXT.  THE KITE

It dips in the sky.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE

				LOUIS
		See?

				GAGE
		Gage fline it!!

				LOUIS (tenderly)
		Bet your ass, little hero.

He kisses his son. They look up at:

EXT.  THE KITE

Dipping and drifting in that gorgeous fall sky.

				IRWIN GOLDMAN (voice)
		Where were you while he was playing in
		the road? Thinking about your stupid
		medical articles? You stinking shit!
		You killer of children!

INT.  THE FUNERAL CHAPEL, WITH LOUIS AND IRWIN

				IRWIN
		You--

But there is no way he can express his outrage with mere words. As 
LOUIS sits staring numbly up at him, IRWIN punches him in the 
nose. LOUIS sprawls backward, falling out of the pew onto the 
floor.

INT.  THE REAR OF THE CHAPEL, FEATURING RACHEL AND DORY

RACHEL screams and starts forward. DORY pulls her back.

				RACHEL
		Louis! Daddy! Stop it! STOP IT!

INT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN

LOUIS is getting up groggily. Hs nose is pouring blood.

				IRWIN
		How do you like that, you son
		of a bitch? I should have done
		it sooner!

IRWIN punches him in the stomach. LOUIS "oofs" and doubles over.

INT.  ANGLE ON THE OTHER MOURNERS

Among them we see STEVE MASTERTON and MARCY CHARLTON.

				STEVE (getting up)
		Hey!

INT.  LOUIS AND IRWIN

LOUIS is slowly straightening up. IRWIN is in a sour frenzy of 
glee.

				IRWIN
		How do you like that? How do--

LOUIS pushes the old man with both hands.

INT.  IRWIN GOLDMAN

He goes stumbling and flailing backwards...strikes the coffin... 
knocks it off its bier. A SCREAM goes up from the mourners.

INT.  RACHEL AND DORY

RACHEL screams. Her mother struggles to hold her but RACHEL easily 
breaks free and goes running down the aisle.

INT.  ANGLE ON MOURNERS, WITH MARCY AND STEVE

				MARCY
		Stop them. Right now.

STEVE gets up and goes toward:

INT.  THE FRONT OF THE CHAPEL, WITH IRWIN

He's picking himself out of a tangled mess of coffin and 
overturned floral tributes. His suit is wet from spilled water. 
He's weeping.

LOUIS has just reached him, and that stunned look is gone. I think 
he intends to do the Cool Jerk all over IRWIN GOLDMAN'S puny 
little body. IRWIN strikes a Gentleman Jim Corbett pugilistic 
pose.

				IRWIN
		Come on! I'm ready for ya! I'll
		take y'apart!

As LOUIS wades in, STEVE MASTERTON gets between them...at the last 
possible moment.

				STEVE
		Stop it!

LOUIS swings. STEVE manages to block the punch with his body.

				STEVE
		Stop it! Jesus, what's wrong with
		you, Louis? It's your son's funeral,
		not a boxing match!

That gets to LOUIS. He drops his fists. That stunned expression 
creeps over his face again--that look that says he doesn't have 
the slightest clue as to what's going on or how it could possibly 
have happened.

INT.  LOUIS

				PASCOW (voice)
		The soil of a man's heart is stonier,
		doc--

LOUIS turns toward:

INT.  THE FRONT PEW, WITH PASCOW AND CHURCH

PASCOW, bloody and ruined in his jogging shorts and muscle shirt, 
has the pew to himself...except for CHURCH, who is sitting on his 
lap and PURRING.

				PASCOW
		A man grows what he can...and tends it.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

A sense of horrible awareness comes into his face...and then he 
covers it with his hands and begins to SOB.

SOUND, COMING UP: A TRUCK MOTOR.

INT.  THE CAB OF THE TANKER

The trucker is singing along with the radio.

INT.  THE GAS PEDAL

It's closer to the floorboards than ever.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE WITH THE KITE, IN THE FIELD

We are at some distance--far enough to see that the two of them 
have moved quite close to the road.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE, A NEW ANGLE (KITE'S POV)

We can see their faces upturned to us--we can hear the AMPLIFIED 
RATTLING SOUND of the kite itself.

THE CAMERA PANS TO THE LEFT--to the road. And we can see the 
truck, fairly close by now, and coming closer.

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE, WITH RACHEL, ELLIE, AND JUD

JUD'S lighting a cigarette. His Walkman 'phones are around his 
neck.

				ELLIE
		I want to fly it! Can I fly it now,
		mommy!

				RACHEL
		In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his
		turn.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE

This is the last moment of happiness in this man's life--so let's 
make it very happy. As he and GAGE stare up at the kite:

				IRWIN (voice)
		Jesus. Louis. I'm sorry--

INT.  THE FUNERAL CHAPEL

The fight has gone out of IRWIN and STEVE has backed away--but 
cautiously. He's ready to jump back in if one or the other goes 
mad again. But IRWIN is shuffling toward LOUIS, hands out--
everyone else has gathered in a knot near the front of the chapel. 
Among them is RACHEL and her mother, weeping in each others' arms.

				IRWIN
		I don't know what happened to me.
		Louis, please--

LOUIS brushes by him with no acknowledgement that IRWIN even 
exists. He kneels down slowly by the coffin and puts his head 
against it.

				LOUIS (weeping)
		I'm sorry, Gage--I'm so sorry,
		little hero.

EXT.  LOUIS AND GAGE, IN THE FIELD

There's a strong gust of wind. The ball of string falls out of 
GAGE'S hand.

EXT.  THE KITE, BLOWING AWAY

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE

				ELLIE
		It got away from him! That numb shit!

				RACHEL (outraged)
		Ellen Creed!

EXT.  THE BALL OF KITE TWINE

It is bouncing and unraveling. More importantly, it is being 
carried directly toward the highway.

EXT.  GAGE

He takes off after the ball of twine.

				GAGE
		Kite fline too fast!

SOUND: The oncoming truck.

EXT.  THE TRUCK

Slamming toward us--a brutal leviathan on eighteen wheels.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's looking--looking toward his people at the picnic table.

				LOUIS (shrugs, good-humored)
		What can you d-

TRUCK SOUND CONTINUES.

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE

TRUCK SOUND LOUDER.

Alarm hits JUD'S face. He rises.

				JUD
		Don't let him go in the road, Louis!

RACHEL looks; registers terrible alarm.

				RACHEL (screams)
		Get him, Louis!

EXT.  GAGE

He's still scampering after the bouncing ball of kite-twine, which 
has now almost reached the road.

TRUCK SOUND LOUDER.

EXT.  LOUIS

The SOUND is loud enough so he's having trouble hearing.

				LOUIS (cups his ear)
		What?

EXT.  THE PICNIC TABLE

				RACHEL (shrieks)
		GET THE BABY!!

JUD is running toward the road, although he'll never get to GAGE 
in time; only LOUIS has a chance.

EXT.  LOUIS

Horrible understanding dawns on his face. He whips around and 
sees:

EXT.  GAGE, LOUIS'S POV

The kid's almost in the road; the ball of twine is in it.

RISING DRONE OF THE TRUCK.

EXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK

EXT.  GAGE, RUNNING INTO THE ROAD

				GAGE (cheerful)
		Geddit-geddit-geddit!

EXT.  EVERYONE, KITE'S POV

GAGE reaches the middle of the road as the truck comes around the 
corner. LOUIS is running across the field, getting close to the 
side of the road. RACHEL is clutching ELLIE by the picnic table. 
JUD is helplessly trying to wave the truck down as it passes him.

EXT.  GAGE, IN THE ROAD

As he reaches the broken white line he grabs the ball of string.

SOUND OF THE ONCOMING TRUCK.

GAGE turns his head.

				GAGE (not afraid)
		Druck!

EXT.  THE ONCOMING TRUCK AND THE DRIVER, GAGE'S POV

Suddenly THE DRIVER'S face turns into a Halloween mask of horror. 
He BLASTS THE AIR-HORN.

EXT.  LOUIS, ON THE VERGE OF THE ROAD

				LOUIS (shrieks)
		NO!!

EXT.  GAGE

BLARE OF THE AIR-HORN. A shadow falls over his face. There is an 
audible CLICK! and we FREEZE FRAME. What we have now is a tremen-
dously winning photograph of a little boy, not quite two, with a 
ball of string in his hand...and a shadow lying across his face.

EXT.  PHOTO MONTAGE

a.) LOUIS is pushing RACHEL out of a hospital door. RACHEL is in a 
wheelchair and looks radiantly happy (so, for that matter, does 
LOUIS). I think we may safely assume that the small blanketed 
bundle in RACHEL'S arms is GAGE.

b.) LOUIS, bare to the waist, is tubbing a two-month-old GAGE in a 
baby-tub. He's laughing. The infant looks confused but calm.

c.) The whole family by the Christmas tree, following an orgy of 
present-opening. ELLIE, about five, has a doll in each hand. LOUIS 
and RACHEL are in pajamas. GAGE, about five months, is lying in a 
drift of wrapping paper. He looks confused but calm.

d.) A child's sneaker lying in the road. It's splashed with blood.

e.) GAGE--he's about nine months old in this snap--is propped up 
in the angle of a sofa. There's a big white rabbit in his lap. 
GAGE looks c. but c.

f.) ELLIE and GAGE, bundled up against the Chicago winter. ELLIE 
is pulling a child's chair-sled. GAGE is propped up in the chair. 
He's about eleven months old in this snap. He's laughing.

g.) The Orinco tanker, overturned on the far side of Route 9.

h.) This one was taken at Gage's first birthday party. He's 
wearing a party-hat and looking at a birthday cake with a single 
candle on it while LOUIS kisses one cheek and RACHEL kisses the 
other.

i.) LOUIS, in the road. He's holding GAGE'S jumper, which is torn, 
blood-soaked, and inside out. LOUIS is looking up toward the sky 
and screaming.

j.) Here is a full-face studio portrait of GAGE. He is smiling at 
us, heartbreakingly lovely. CAMERA HOLDS ON THIS while:

				JUD (voice)
		Sedative finally took hold. She's asleep.

INT.  THE KITCHEN TABLE, WITH LOUIS

He's holding the studio portrait in his hands and looking at it 
fixedly. The other photos (the good ones, that is; not the 
screamers--those, we may assume, exist only in LOUIS'S tortured 
memory) are scattered on the table. We only saw a few; there are 
actually hundreds.

LOUIS puts the photo down as JUD comes in and crosses to the 
fridge. LOUIS'S nose is badly swelled. He also has a black eye.

JUD gets a couple of beers and comes back toward the table.

				JUD
		Your father-in-law packs a wallop,
		for an old guy. He and his wife gone
		back to Chicago?

				LOUIS
		No...squatting out there at the
		Holiday Inn like a couple of vultures.
		He really thinks Rachel's going to go
		back with them. Her and Ellie.

				JUD
		Louis--

The swing door opens. They look toward:

INT.  ELLIE

She looks dazed and shocked. There are brown circles under her 
eyes, but otherwise her complexion is much too white. She's 
wearing fuzzy pj's. She's carrying the picture of her pulling GAGE 
on the sled.

INT.  JUD AND LOUIS, AT THE TABLE

				ELLIE (coming to the table)
		I want to go back to my own room.
		I can't sleep with mommy. She
		keeps stealing the covers.

				JUD
		What you got there, Ellie?

At first she doesn't want to show him, but JUD is very kind.

				JUD (studying it)
		Why that's real nice...you pullin'
		him on a sled. Bet he liked that,
		didn't he?

ELLIE nods. She is starting to cry. JUD is also leaking at the 
eyes.

				ELLIE (crying)
		I used to pull 'im a lot.

LOUIS, looking down at his hands, nods.

				ELLIE
		I'm going to carry this picture,
		Mr. Crandall, until God lets Gage
		come back.

JUD reacts violently. And LOUIS looks up, dully curious...but 
hasn't the thought already passed through LOUIS'S mind? Yes--I 
think it has.

				JUD
		Ellie...God doesn't do things like
		that. I know you loved y'brother, but--

				ELLIE
		He can if He wants to. He can do
		anything, just like Inspector Gadget
		on TV. But I have to keep things ready
		for him, that's what I think. I've got
		his picture and I'm going to sit in
		his chair--

				LOUIS
		Ellie--

				ELLIE
		And I'm going to eat his breakfast
		cereal, too, even though it tastes
		like boogers. And...and...

She bursts into tears.

				JUD
		Louis, take care of your little
		girl...she needs you.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

His face is stricken.

INT.  ELLIE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

LOUIS comes in with ELLIE in his arms. He puts her gently into her 
bed and pulls the covers up. She's already mostly asleep.

				LOUIS (kisses her)
		Good night, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		G'night daddy.

He starts for the door.

INT.  ELLIE, CU

				ELLIE
		God could take it back if He wanted
		to, couldn't He? If He really, really
		wanted to? Can I have faith in that?

INT.  LOUIS, AT THE DOOR

He stands looking at her for a long time, apparently thinking 
about this quite deeply.

				LOUIS
		Yes--I suppose you can. Good night,
		Ellie.

He steps out, closing the door.

INT.  ELLIE, IN BED

In some sense comforted--it may be a poison comfort but she surely 
doesn't know this--she turns over on her side to go to sleep. We 
can see the picture of GAGE under her arm.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH LOUIS

The light here is fairly dim. LOUIS goes down and opens another 
door. He pokes his head in.

INT.  THE MASTER BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

He reacts first with surprise, then a species of horrified 
disgust.

INT.  LOUIS AND RACHEL'S BED, LOUIS'S POV

CHURCH is crouched on RACHEL'S sleeping form.

INT.  THE BED, A NEW ANGLE

LOUIS comes in and swats the cat a damned good one.

				LOUIS (low snarl)
		Fuck off, hairball!!

INT.  CHURCH, CU

It hisses at him through a mouthful of fangs, its eyes big green 
balls...and then it flees. CAMERA FOLLOWS IT out the door.

INT.  LOUIS, BY THE BED

RACHEL stirs and mutters thickly, then lies still again...she's 
doped to the gills. LOUIS bends over and kisses her gently.

He leaves the room and closes the door behind him.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH LOUIS

He tries the door a couple of times to make sure it's firmly on 
the latch (his face wears an expression of "How'd he get in there 
in the first place?"). Then he walks down the hall to the stairs.

INT.  ON THE STAIRS, CU

The cat is on one of the risers. LOUIS trips over it.

EXT.  ON THE STAIRS WITH LOUIS, WIDER

For a moment he's pinwheeling madly for balance, on the verge of 
falling. He regains his balance as the cat goes shooting across 
the dining room toward the kitchen.

LOUIS regains his equilibrium after a bit and continues on down.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH JUD AND LOUIS AND CHURCH

As LOUIS enters through the swing door from the dining room, JUD 
is just letting CHURCH out the back door. As JUD closes the door:

				LOUIS (slightly antagonistic)
		I thought you'd be gone by now.

				JUD
		I got you a fresh beer out of the
		fridge, Louis.

He indicates the table, where there is indeed a fresh beer.

				LOUIS
		Jud, I buried my son today and
		I'm very tired. I wonder if we
		could just--

				JUD
		You're thinking of things best
		not thought of, Louis.

				LOUIS
		I'm thinking about going to bed.

But he begins pouring the beer into a glass.

				JUD
		You never asked me if anyone had
		buried a person up there in the
		Micmac burying ground--

LOUIS'S hand jerks. Beer goes foaming across the kitchen table.

				JUD
		--but I think the thought
		has crossed your mind.

				LOUIS
		Shit! Look at this mess!

				JUD
		Ayuh--it's a mess, all right.

As LOUIS goes to get a cloth to wipe up the mess:

				JUD
		I know the Micmacs thought it was a
		holy place...and then they thought
		it was a cursed place. That's why
		they moved on.

				LOUIS
		Because something called a wendigo
		soured the ground.

				JUD
		And because the dead walked.

LOUIS stops sopping and looks at him.

INT.  JUD, CU

				JUD
		Oh, ayuh. It's been done. What you've
		been thinking of has been done.

EXT.  A COUNTRY RAILROAD STATION/SEPIA  DAY

The time is the late summer of 1944, although I don't believe we 
need to know that specifically. The sign on the station reads 
LUDLOW. There are a few 40s cars parked near the station--they 
have gas-ration coupons on the windshields. And a hearse.

A train is coming.

EXT.  THE HEARSE, WITH UNDERTAKER AND BILL BATERMAN/SEPIA

We can see the UNDERTAKER is trying to talk to BILL BATERMAN, a 
man in his forties who periodically wipes his brow with a bandana. 
BILL walks away. He doesn't want to talk; he doesn't want comfort. 
He's a grief-stricken, bitter man.

				JUD (voice over)
		Timmy Baterman was on his way home
		from the war with his Purple Heart
		when he got killed in some stupid
		car accident down in Georgia.

EXT.  THE TRAIN, IN FRONT OF THE DEPOT/SEPIA

The door of the mail-car is open. The UNDERTAKER and three 
trainmen are unloading TIMMY BATERMAN'S coffin, which is draped in 
a 48-star flag. BILL BATERMAN stands by, watching balefully as 
they carry his son's final apartment to the back of the hearse and 
load it in.

				JUD (v-o continues)
		Bill was bitter--his son had been in
		the thick of it two years and then got
		shot in the leg--a clean flesh-wound.
		He was supposed to be coming home safe
		and sound. Instead, he come home in a
		box after all.

EXT.  THE REAR OF THE HEARSE/SEPIA

The doors close. The hearse pulls away. THE CAMERA PANS TO BILL 
BATERMAN, who stands staring balefully after it and mopping his 
brow.

				JUD (v-o continues)
		He wasn't able to get to the bottom
		of the truth, Louis.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD  NIGHT

LOUIS is now sitting down, drinking a beer, staring at JUD.

				LOUIS
		I'll bite--what's the bottom of the
		truth, Jud?

				JUD
		Why...that sometimes dead is better.
		That's all. Sometimes dead is better.

				LOUIS (bitter)
		Tell that to my wife and little girl.

				JUD
		It ain't your wife and little girl
		that's got me worried, Louis.

EXT.  THE LUDLOW CEMETARY/SEPIA  DUSK

We're featuring a fresh grave...that of TIMMY BATERMAN. A truck, 
showing only parking lights, turns into the graveyard and drives 
slowly up to it. It stops, and BILL BATERMAN gets out. HE looks at 
the grave and then goes to the back of his truck.

				JUD (voice-over)
		Timmy was buried on July 22nd, as
		I remember.

EXT.  BILL BATERMAN AT THE BACK OF HIS TRUCK/SEPIA  DUSK

He reaches in...and brings out a pick and shovel.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  MARGIE WASHBURN, ON HER PORCH/SEPIA  DAY

She's a middle-aged woman dressed in mid-forties style. She's got 
a rug-beater in one hand; the other is up to her eyes to shade the 
sun. She's staring at something, horrified.

				JUD (v-o continues)
		It was four or five days later when...

EXT.  A COUNTRY DIRT ROAD, WITH TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA  DAY

A young man dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt is shambling up the 
road. His eyes are vacant. His shirt is half untucked. His hair is 
sticking up in a wild crow's-nest thatch. There is an ugly mess of 
healed scars on his neck and one side of his face. I think one of 
his ears may be gone--torn off in the accident.

				JUD (v-o continues)
		...Margie Washburn seen him walking
		up the road toward Yorkie's Livery.

EXT.  MARGIE/SEPIA

She's screaming--we hear her faintly.

EXT.  TIMMY/SEPIA

He turns toward her and we see a green light like the St. Elmo's 
fire in the Little God Swamp glow dimly deep in his eyes. He grins 
at MARGIE.

EXT.  IN FRONT OF THE LUDLOW TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA

She hesitates for a moment or two and then walks up toward the 
door.

				JUD (v.o.)
		Lots of people saw Timmy Baterman
		walking back and forth between the
		home place and the town line. But 
		it was Margie...

INT.  THE TOWN OFFICES, WITH MARGIE/SEPIA

She's in a hallway in front of a door with LUDLOW SELECTMEN 
printed on the frosted glass. After a moment she opens it and goes 
in.

				JUD (v.o. continues)
		...who finally got up enough guts to
		talk to the town fathers about it.
		She knew it had to be stopped, Louis.

INT.  THE SELECTMEN'S OFFICE/SEPIA

MARGIE and four men are grouped around a desk. She's talking; 
they're listening. THE CAMERA LAZILY PANS the four men--one, of 
course, is JUD as a YOUNG MAN.

				JUD (v.o. continues)
		She knew it was an abomination.
		George Anderson, the town postmaster,
		was there...and Alan Purinton...Hannibal
		Benson...and me. I was there.

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE/SEPIA  SUNSET

It's a ramshackle old farm which looks remarkably like the estate 
of that gentleman farmer Jordy Verrill.

An old Ford pulls into the driveway, and the four men get out.

SOUND BLEEDS IN: Most of all the SOUND OF THE CRICKETS.

They go to the door, and JUD is wordlessly elected as the prime 
honcho. He knocks. No answer. Again. No answer.

SOUND: Crazy laughter.

				BILL BATERMAN (voice)
		Stop that, Timmy!

The four men look at each other.

				JUD
		Come on.

They start around to the back.

EXT.  THE BACK YARD, WITH BILL AND TIMMY/SEPIA

TIMMY BATERMAN is staring directly into the setting sun, his eyes 
glowing with green fire. He's laughing like Goofy gone insane. 
BILL, scared, is trying to make him stop, to turn away from the 
sun.

EXT.  THE BACK YARD, A NEW ANGLE/SEPIA

The four men come around the side of the house. They freeze when 
they see BILL and TIMMY.

				ALAN
		Oh holy Jesus lookit that.

BILL whirls around and sees them.

				BILL
		You men get out of here!

				JUD
		I heard your boy was killed down
		Georgia.

				BILL (agitated)
		That was a mistake!

				HANNIBAL
		Was it?

				BILL
		You see him standing there,
		don't you? Now get out! Get the
		Christ off my land!

Now TIMMY turns around and comes shambling forward.

				TIMMY (laughing)
		Ge ow! Ge Cwise off eye an!

				GEORGE (revolted)
		Oh Jesus, Jud! He's dead! I can
		smell him!

				BILL
		He ain't dead! Give him a day or two
		and he'll be fine! Don't you say that!

				JUD
		Bill, this ain't right--you can see
		that yourself--

				BILL (screaming)
		GET OUT! YOU HEAR? GET OUT!!!

EXT.  TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA

				TIMMY (laughing)
		Dead! We love dead! Hate living!

Abruptly he reaches up with both hands and scratches down his 
cheeks, goring deep grooves in his flesh. Blood flows sluggishly 
out. Very weird blood.

EXT.  THE ENTIRE GROUP/SEPIA

BILL grabs TIMMY, who's still laughing wildly, and gets him turned 
around. TIMMY shambles back to where he was originally standing. 
BILL goes with him like a man who has charge over a trained 
baboon. A stupid trained baboon.

				BILL (over his shoulder)
		You want to get out of here before I get
		my shotgun! You boys are trespassing!

EXT.  THE FOUR MEN/SEPIA

				JUD
		God help you, Bill.

EXT.  BILL AND TIMMY BATERMAN/SEPIA

				BILL (snarls)
		God never helped me. I helped
		myself.

EXT.  TIMMY BATERMAN, CU/SEPIA

Staring directly into the setting sun and laughing wildly, 
mindlessly.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD

				LOUIS
		What happened?

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE--MONTAGE  NIGHT

a.) A car pulls up with its lights off and stops.

				JUD (v.o.)
		There was a fire.

b.) We see legs as people get out of the car, and hands holding 
tin cans of gasoline.

c.) Hands splash gasoline from the cans along the sides of the 
house.

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PORCH  NIGHT

JUD (as a young man) rings the bell--an old-fashioned twist type.

				BILL (voice)
		Who's there?

				TIMMY (laughing, screeching voice)
		Ooo air? Ooo air?

				JUD
		Get out, Billy--the place is
		going up.

He walks away. BILL BATERMAN, wearing a strappy tee-shirt, looks 
out the window.

				BILL
		I seen you! I seen you, Jud Crandall!

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE--MONTAGE  NIGHT

a.) A match is struck...and applied to wet boards. Whoosh!

b.) The other side of the house: The same.

c.) In the back yard, JUD lights a torch and heaves it through the 
kitchen windows. Ka-PLOOM!

d.) The men draw away toward the front, their faces grim and 
judgmental.

EXT.  THE BATERMAN PLACE  NIGHT

Burning. Going up fast.

EXT.  THE MEN

				ALAN
		You think Bill's gonna get out, Jud?

				JUD (stony)
		If he don't, he don't.

EXT.  THE FRONT DOOR

It bursts open. We see two men struggling at the forefront of an 
inferno--correction, one man and an undead monster. TIMMY is 
giggling and screaming, trying to pull his father back into the 
flames.

				BILL (struggling)
		No! No, Timmy! Let me go!

				TIMME (laughing)
		Love dead! Hate living!

He sinks his teeth into his father's arm. BILL screams.

A beam falls on TIMMY, lighting him afire. BILL breaks free and 
runs down the porch steps.

INT.  THE FRONT HALL, WITH TIMMY

He's burning and laughing.

				TIMMY
		LOVE DEAD! HATE LIVING!

And into the fire he goes, still shrieking and laughing.

EXT.  THE FRONT YARD  NIGHT

BILL BATERMAN is collapsed on the lawn as sparks drift down around 
him, his face hidden against his thighs, weeping.

CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the four men, who are grouped at the end 
of the driveway by the road and staring with awe at:

EXT.  THE BLAZING FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS AND JUD

				JUD (softly)
		Sometimes dead is better, Louis.

BLACK. And on it, a sixth title card: THE DEAD WALK.

SOUND BLEEDS IN: JET ENGINES.

EXT.  BANGOR INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL  DAY

A jet plane rises into the sky from behind the building.

				GATE AGENT'S VOICE
		This is the final call for United's
		flight 61 to Chicago...

INT.  A BOARDING GATE, WITH LOUIS AND RACHEL

In the b.g. we can see IRWIN and DORY GOLDMAN waiting by the 
jetway with ELLIE as the last few passengers board. RACHEL looks 
confused and grief-stricken. She also looks punchy, doped up. I 
imagine she's floating on a sea of Valium, and that makes her 
easier to deal with. LOUIS'S battle-scars are fading a little.

The GATE AGENT is standing by the jetway with a mike in one hand 
and a bunch of boarding passes in the other.

				GATE AGENT (concludes)
		All passengers should now be aboard.

				LOUIS
		You better get going, hon.

				RACHEL
		Oh Louis, I just don't know about
		this--

				LOUIS
		I told you last night--this can be the
		start of patching things up with your
		folks. If something good doesn't come
		of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.

				RACHEL
		Louis, are you sure?

				LOUIS
		I'm sure.

INT.  THE GOLDMANS, WITH ELLIE

				ELLIE
		I don't want to go to Chicago,
		Gramma Dory.

				DORY
		Why not, darling?

				ELLIE
		I had a bad dream last night. A
		nightmare.

				IRWIN (kindly)
		About what?

				ELLIE
		About Daddy. (Pause) And Gage.

DORY and IRWIN exchange a knowing, sad glance over the child's 
head.

				ELLIE
		And someone named Paxcow.

INT.  RACHEL AND LOUIS

LOUIS guides her to the jetway.

				LOUIS
		Come on, you guys--before you miss
		the boat.

He kisses DORY. IRWIN hugs him.

				IRWIN
		Louis, I am sorry. What can I say?
		That I lost my mind? It's the truth,
		but no good excuse.

				LOUIS (hugs him back)
		We all lost our minds, Irwin.

LOUIS kisses RACHEL. Then he kneels and hugs ELLIE.

				LOUIS
		Be good to your mother, darlin'.
		She needs you.

				ELLIE
		Come with us, daddy. Please come
		with us!

				LOUIS
		I'll be there in three days--four
		at the most. I've got to get the
		electricity shut off and square
		things with your school so the
		truant officer ain't after you, and--

INT.  ELLIE, CU

				ELLIE (crying)
		Please, daddy! I'm scared!

INT.  LOUIS AND ELLIE

				LOUIS
		Of what?

				ELLIE (crying harder)
		I don't know.

				LOUIS (great emphasis)
		Everything's going to be all right,
		Ellie. Now go on--get aboard.

				ELLIE
		Do you swear?

				LOUIS
		I swear.

The Voice of Authority has spoken. We can tell by ELLIE'S face 
that while things are still not all right, they are a little 
better. She joins her mother.

The four of them--RACHEL, ELLIE, and THE GOLDMANS--start down the 
jetway. ELLIE looks back once, as if begging him to come...and 
then they're gone.

INT.  LOUIS, CU

LOUIS'S face changes. Now it is a stony and contemplative face. 
Not, when you get right down to it, a very nice face.

He turns and strides away.

INT.  THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT, WITH LOUIS

The family station wagon is in the f.g. We hear the SOUND OF JET 
ENGINES, and as LOUIS reaches the wagon he turns and watches:

EXT.  THE TERMINAL,, LOUIS'S POV

From behind it a United Airlines jet lifts into view and banks 
away.

EXT.  LOUIS, IN THE PARKING LOT

Face set, he gets into the wagon and drives away.

EXT.  ROUTE 15 IN BREWER

The CREEDmobile pulls up across from the Brewer Tru-Value Hardware 
and LOUIS crosses to it.

INT.  THE HARDWARE STORE COUNTER, CU

On it: A six-cell flashlight, Duracell D-batteries, a pick, a 
shovel, and a nylon drop-sheet in cellophane packaging. Now the 
CLERK'S hands come into the frame and drop a pair of heavy work-
gloves into the pile.

INT.  LOUIS AND CLERK (SMALL PUN, HEE-HEE)

				CLERK
		Anything else for you today?

				LOUIS (after a look)
		I think we got it all.

The CLERK starts to ring things up.

				CLERK
		Looks like heavy work.

				LOUIS
		It could be.

The quality of LOUIS'S reply is somehow unnatural. The CLERK looks 
at him, momentarily unsure and uncertain. Then he starts ringing 
things up again.

INT.  A UNITED JETLINER, WITH ELLIE AND RACHEL

ELLIE is in the window-seat, asleep. RACHEL is holding a paperback 
but not reading it. Her eyes are red. She's looking into space.

CAMERA DRIFTS TO ELLIE. Her sleep is not easy. Her head turns from 
side to side, as if in negation. She becomes steadily more upset. 
She's starting to mutter. Suddenly her eyes flare open and she 
screams.

INT.  JETLINER, SLIGHTLY WIDER

We can see the GOLDMANS in the seats behind the CREEDS. They are 
startled. So are other passengers. A stewardess comes running.

				ELLIE
		Paxcow says it's almost too late!

				RACHEL
		Ellie...Ellie...what...

				ELLIE
		Paxcow says it's almost too late!
		We have to go back! Paxcow says it's
		almost too late!

EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETARY  DAY

The CREED wagon turns in and drives up one of the lanes. It stops 
and LOUIS gets out.

EXT.  LOUIS

He walks to a fresh grave on which the first flowers are already 
starting to wilt. He sits down and takes a flower. He plucks it, 
looking at the grave steadily. He says nothing for a long time.

				LOUIS
		It's wrong. (Pause) What happened
		to you is wrong.

EXT.  GAGE, IN THE FIELD

He runs toward THE CAMERA, happy and laughing, in SLOW MOTION.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

LOUIS is now weeping, but he seems calm just the same.

				PASCOW (voice)
		Remember, doc.

LOUIS looks at:

EXT.  A TOMB, LOUIS'S POV

PASCOW, bloody and mutilated, is standing by it.

				PASCOW
		The barrier was not meant to be
		crossed. The ground is sour.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

He is not put out of countenance in the slightest by PASCOW'S 
appearance; he probably knows PASCOW is just a figment of his 
conscience or imagination, and so do we.

				LOUIS
		I'll tell you where the ground
		is sour--the ground in my heart
		is sour. Let me tell you something
		else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.

EXT.  PASCOW

				PASCOW
		Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

				LOUIS
		Don't talk like an asshole even if
		you are just a bit of underdone
		potato or a blot of mustard.

EXT.  PASCOW, BY THE TOMB

He stands mute, just looking.

EXT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS (weeping)
		He was my son! He wasn't even two
		and he was run down in the fucking
		road and he was almost in pieces,
		and if you don't think I'm going
		to try...

EXT.  THE TOMB, SANS PASCOW

VIC has put on his boogie shoes.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

He's crying harder. Abruptly he reaches out at the floral tributes 
and knocks a bunch of them over.

				LOUIS
		If it doesn't work--if he comes
		back like Timmy Baterman--I'll
		put him to sleep. But I'm going
		to try. (Pause) And if it doesn't
		work...they don't ever need to know.

EXT.  THE GOLDMAN HOUSE IN LAKE FOREST, ILLINOIS  NIGHT

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL  NIGHT

THE CAMERA MOVES LEISURELY along this hallway, which is lined with 
pictures of RACHEL, ELLIE...and GAGE (there may even be a couple 
in which LOUIS is featured, but damned few). Near the end of the 
hall a door is open and light spills out.

				RACHEL (voice)
		Honey, you just had a bad dream. You
		know that, don't you?

				ELLIE (voice)
		It wasn't a dream. It was Paxcow.

THE CAMERA GOES THROUGH THE DOOR and into the room where ELLIE is 
staying. She's in bed, still badly upset. RACHEL is sitting on the 
bed beside her. There's a single lamp on the bedside table.

				ELLIE
		Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something
		really bad. He--

				RACHEL
		Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the
		boogeyman?

				ELLIE
		He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.

RACHEL turns off the bed-lamp.

				RACHEL
		There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you
		to go to sleep and forget all this
		nonsense.

				ELLIE
		Will you at least call and make sure
		daddy's okay?

				RACHEL
		Of course I will.

She kisses ELLIE.

				RACHEL
		Now will you try to go to sleep?

				ELLIE (turns over on her side)
		Yes, Mom.

RACHEL gets up and leaves the room.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

PASCOW is here, halfway down the hall to the stairs, bloody as 
ever. RACHEL doesn't see him. She looks perplexed, a woman trying 
to think of something. She stops very near him.

				RACHEL (to herself)
		Paxcow, why do I know that name?

				PASCOW
		Pascow.

RACHEL suddenly straightens. She looks startled and afraid.

				RACHEL
		Pascow? Was she saying Pascow?

She suddenly heads for the stairs, fast.

EXT.  THE CREED HOME IN LUDLOW  NIGHT

SOUND: A car starting up.

The station wagon backs out and heads down the driveway. As it 
passes THE CAMERA, we see LOUIS driving. The wagon turns onto 
Route 9 and heads off.

CAMERA HOLDS ON THE HOUSE. A beat of silence. Then: the telephone 
starts ringing.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

IRWIN and DORY are watching RACHEL with some anxiety. RACHEL is 
holding the phone to her ear. We can hear the FILTERED SOUND of 
one ring after another. She hangs up.

				RACHEL
		He's not home.

				DORY
		Why, he probably went out for
		a hamburger or a chicken dinner,
		dear. You know how men are when
		they're alone.

Good old IRWIN'S face says that maybe LOUIS went out for a couple 
of grams of coke and a whore in Nazi SS boots.

RACHEL is dialing another number.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL HOUSE  NIGHT

SOUND: Phone starts to ring.

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD

He shuffles to the telephone. His Walkman 'phones are around his 
neck. He's got a bottle of beer in one hand.

				JUD (picks up)
		Hello--you got Judson.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL

				RACHEL
		It's Rachel Creed, Jud. I'm
		calling from Chicago.

				JUD (surprised voice)
		Chicago! Is Louis with you?

				RACHEL
		No...we're going to be here
		awhile, and he wanted a few days
		to wind up our affairs there.
		I just wondered if he was with you.

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD

His face says this is very serious.

				JUD
		No--but if he drops by, I'll tell
		him to call you.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM

				RACHEL
		Jud, do you remember the name
		of the student that died on Louis's
		first day at work? The one that was
		hit by a car?

				JUD (voice)
		I don't--

				RACHEL
		Was it Pascow?

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD

				JUD
		Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis
		come home before I go to bed, I'll
		tell him to--

INT.  THE GOLDMAN LIVING ROOM, WITH RACHEL

				RACHEL
		Don't bother. I'm coming home.

				JUD (alarmed voice)
		Rachel!

				RACHEL
		Thank you, Jud. Goodbye.

She hangs up.

INT.  THE CRANDALL KITCHEN, WITH JUD

				JUD
		No! Rachel! Don't do that!
		Rachel--!

The buzz of an open line. Connection broken. JUD slowly replaces 
the receiver. The man looks very grim.

INT.  THE FRONT HALL OF THE GOLDMAN HOUSE

RACHEL comes down the stairs, dressed for travelling. She's 
carrying a suitcase in one hand. Her parents meet her at the foot 
of the stairs.

				DORY
		Rachel...darling...you're upset...
		a night's sleep...

				RACHEL
		I have to go. The connections are 
		tight, and I have to be at O'Hare in 
		forty minutes. Will you drive me,
		daddy?

				IRWIN
		You know something's wrong, don't you?
		You know. And Ellie does, too.

				RACHEL
		Yes.

				IRWIN
		I'll drive you.

				ELLIE (voice)
		Mommy?

They all turn to:

INT.  ELLIE, ON THE STAIRS

				ELLIE
		Please hurry.

INT.  RACHEL AND THE GOLDMANS

				RACHEL
		I will. Come and kiss me.

ELLIE races into her arms.

EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETERY  NIGHT

SOUND Of a car engine, THROBBING AND LOW. It cuts off.

CAMERA MOVES IN on the low stone wall between the cemetery and the 
road. Beyond it we can see the roof of the CREED station wagon.

LOUIS appears, dressed in dark clothes. He looks both ways, then 
tosses a big duffle bag over the wall. Stuff clanks inside.

LOUIS climbs over the wall, grabs his bag, and checks out the 
scene.

EXT.  LUDLOW CEMETERY, LOUIS'S POV

A quiet city of the dead. Spooky. SOUND of crickets: Ree-ree-
ree...

EXT.  LOUIS

He heads for GAGE'S grave.

INT.  THE GOLDMAN CAR, WITH RACHEL AND IRWIN

				IRWIN
		I'll come with you if you want,
		honey.

				RACHEL (shakes her head)
		I've got three planes to catch and
		I got the last seats on two of them.
		It's like God saved them for me.

EXT.  O'HARE UNITED AIRLINES TERMINAL, WITH IRWIN'S CAR

IRWIN'S car heads for it.

EXT.  THE GRAVE OF GAGE CREED

LOUIS approaches it slowly and sets down his bag of grave-robbing 
equipment. He sets aside the remaining floral tributes and then 
opens the bag and takes out the spade. He looks down at the grave 
for a long second.

				LOUIS (low)
		Gonna bust you out, son.

He starts to shovel.

EXT.  THE SHOVEL, CU

Digging...throwing...digging again. Already the shape of the 
excavation is beginning to show. The work is easy; this earth is 
new and fresh.

EXT.  JETLINER, IN A LINE-UP OF JETLINERS

INT.  JETLINER, WITH RACHEL

Everyone looks impatient, but RACHEL looks half crazy.

				PILOT (voice)
		This is the Captain speaking.
		I'm sorry about this delay, folks,
		but we've got a real low ceiling
		tonight and air traffic control's
		playing it safe. Looks like it's
		going to be about half an hour before
		we get on a roll, so I'm turning off
		the NO SMOKING sign.

SOUND: Bing!

There's a general groan. CAMERA MOVES IN ON RACHEL, who has closed 
her eyes. I think she's praying.

EXT.  GAGE'S GRAVE  NIGHT

Now it's pretty deep. Four feet, maybe. LOUIS is standing in it. 
We see his feet as the shovel goes up and down, up and down.

EXT.  LOUIS  NIGHT

He's sweating and dirt-streaked. He's tossing dirt on a big pile. 
Suddenly, as he takes another shovelful, we hear a SCRAPING SOUND. 
He tosses the shovel aside and squats.

EXT.  IN THE GRAVE, WITH LOUIS

There's a white streak on the bottom of the grave--the top of 
GAGE'S coffin. LOUIS swipes his hand through the loose dirt, 
uncovering more, and then he begins to sweep off the top of the 
coffin with his hands.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL PORCH

JUD comes out. He's wearing a light jacket. His Walkman 'phones 
are around his neck. He's got a six-pack. He looks at:

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE, JUD'S POV

It's dark.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL PORCH, WITH JUD

He sits down.

				JUD
		You done it, you stupid old man...
		now you got to undo it.

He puts his earphones on. Cracks a beer. Lights a cigarette. 
Pushes the PLAY button on the deck. Faint SOUNDS of The Clash 
buzz-sawing "Rock The Casbah."

JUD begins to watch.

EXT.  LOUIS

He climbs out of the grave and opens his duffle bag. He starts to 
pull out the pick.

SOUND of an approaching car.

LOUIS freezes.

EXT.  THE ROAD OUTSIDE OF THE CEMETERY

A police car comes cruising slowly along. The spotlight on the 
driver's side comes on and runs along the graveyard's stone wall.

EXT.  LOUIS

Watching. Waiting. Hardly breathing.

EXT.  THE POLICE CAR

It reaches the end of the wall. Everything looks jake. The 
spotlight goes out and the police car speeds up.

EXT.  LOUIS

He relaxes perceptibly. He gets the pick and drops back into the 
grave.

EXT.  THE TOP OF THE COFFIN, CU

LOUIS inserts the tip of the pick in the flange of the coffin and 
levers it. CRACKING SOUND. Again. More CRACKING. Again. And the 
lock breaks. The coffin lid comes up a little, dirt gritting in 
the hinges.

EXT.  LOUIS, CU

Here's a man on the thinnest edge between sanity and madness.

EXT.  JETLINER LIFTING OFF FROM O'HARE

INT.  RACHEL AND HER SEATMATE

				SEATMATE
		Think you'll make your connection
		in Boston?

				RACHEL
		I have to.

EXT.  LOUIS, BY GAGE'S GRAVE

He's lying on his stomach, reaching in. We hear the SOUND of dirt 
grating in hinges again.

EXT.  LOUIS, CU

We're looking up into his face. If GAGE had a POV, this would be 
it. LOUIS'S face fills with a terrible grief.

				LOUIS
		Oh, Gage--oh, honey.

EXT.  JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH

His chin slips to his chest, even though we hear Creedence on his 
'phones and to him the sound must be at blastoff levels. There's a 
long round ash on his cigarette in the tray. A couple of empty 
beer cans on the table beside him.

A truck blasts by, startling him out of his doze. He jerks his 
head up suddenly...and slaps himself. He's okay...for now.

EXT.  THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS

He is sitting on the edge of the grave, holding his dead son in 
his arms, rocking him. GAGE is back to us. We see only a small 
limp figure in a dark suit. Hair flops limply.

				LOUIS
		It's going to be all right...I
		swear it's going to be all right...

The canvas tarp has been spread open to the right. LOUIS begins to 
lay his son down on it.

EXT.  THE GROUND BESIDE THE TARP, CU

It's littered with flower petals. One limp hand appears among 
them.

EXT.  LOUIS

He closes the tarp over GAGE, making a roll. He then produces rope 
from the duffle bag. He cuts the rope and begins to tie one piece 
around one end of the canvas roll containing the corpse of his 
son.

EXT.  JETLINER IN THE NIGHT SKY

				PILOT (voice)
		Good evening again, ladies and
		gentlemen...

INT.  THE JETLINER, WITH RACHEL

Her seatmate is knitting something. Across the aisle sits VICTOR 
PASCOW, bloody but serene, hands clasped in his lap, looking 
straight ahead. RACHEL looks around tensely.

				PILOT (continues)
		I'm delighted to tell you that we've
		got a strong tail-wind tonight and
		we expect to arrive at Boston's
		Logan Airport almost on time.

PASCOW clenches his fist in a "That's one for our side!" gesture.

				RACHEL (softly)
		Thank God.

Her SEATMATE looks at her a bit strangely.

EXT.  THE GRAVEYARD, WITH LOUIS

He's got the bundle containing his son and the duffle-bag with the 
tools. He runs bent over. He reaches the wall and there's the 
SOUND of another motor. He crouches at the base of the wall.

EXT.  THE ROAD

Here comes that same police car. The spotlight runs along the 
wall.

EXT.  LOUIS

Crouching against his side of the wall and sweating.

EXT.  THE POLICE CAR

It stops. The COP gets out. He walks slowly toward the wall.

EXT.  LOUIS

Crouched. Now we see the COP looking over the top. If he looks 
down...but he doesn't. Instead he turns around so we see his back. 
LOUIS looks up, miserably scared, pouring sweat.

Silence. Then: SOUND of the cop taking a whiz.

EXT.  THE COP

Ah! Relief. SOUND of his fly being zipped. He looks back at the 
cemetery for a moment.

				COP
		I ain't afraid of no ghost.

He walks back to his cruiser, gets in, and hauls ass.

EXT.  LOUIS, BEHIND THE WALL

He collapses with relief. Then he gets up and looks cautiously 
over the wall. Nothing there but his car, parked a little way down 
on the other side of the road.

He tosses the duffle bag over the top of the wall. He puts the 
canvas roll containing GAGE on top of the wall. Then he vaults 
over.

EXT.  THE STREET SIDE OF THE WALL, WITH LOUIS

He takes the roll, gets the duffle bag hooked over his shoulder by 
the string, and runs across the road like a soldier crossing enemy 
territory. He goes to the rear of the wagon.

EXT.  THE REAR OF THE WAGON, WITH LOUIS

He puts the body down. He feels in his pocket for his keys. No 
keys. Mild consternation. He looks around, feeling exposed. The 
other pocket. Still no keys. More consternation. He begins to hunt 
feverishly through his pockets. Maybe in his jacket? Nope.

SOUND: An approaching car.

EXT.  PASSING CAR

A civilian--not the ubiquitous cop.

EXT.  LOUIS

He turns his pockets out, spilling change everywhere. Nothing. 
Suddenly a little light goes on in his eyes. He goes to the 
driver's side of the car and looks in at:

INT.  IGNITION, LOUIS'S POV

The keys are in the switch.

EXT.  LOUIS

He snatches the keys and returns to the back of the wagon. He uses 
the key to open the doorgate. He puts GAGE'S body in gently, then 
the duffle bag. He closes the doorgate and returns to the front of 
the car. He opens the driver's door and freezes.

LOUIS returns to the rear, gets his keys from the doorgate, comes 
back to the front, gets in, and drives away.

INT.  A JETWAY AT LOGAN INTERNATIONAL

People are debarking into the gate area. Through them comes 
RACHEL, running fast, pushing some people, excusing herself 
incoherently. PASCOW is walking near her.

				PASCOW
		There's just time. If you run.

Without looking at PASCOW, RACHEL takes off her shoes and runs.

INT.  THE CONCOURSE, WITH RACHEL

She's sprinting down the concourse--look out, Joanie Benoit!

INT.  GATE 27, WITH FEMALE GATE AGENT AND PASCOW

The FEMALE GATE AGENT is starting to close the jetway door.

				PASCOW
		Don't do that, babe.

The GATE AGENT looks puzzled, as if she just had a thought (or 
maybe a gas pain). She stops closing the door. RACHEL runs into 
the area. She sees:

INT./EXT.  THE JET PLANE, THROUGH THE GATE WINDOWS

It is just starting to swing ponderously away from the jetway.

INT.  RACHEL AND FEMALE GATE AGENT (PASCOW IS GONE)

				RACHEL
		Make it come back!

				FEMALE GATE AGENT
		I can't--

RACHEL bolts down the jetway. The GATE AGENT stares after her, and 
then runs for her stand, where we can see FLIGHT 61 and BANGOR on 
the slide-cards. She picks up her mike.

EXT.  THE JETWAY  NIGHT

RACHEL stands all alone at the end of it.

AMPLIFIED SOUNDS OF JET ENGINES.

				RACHEL (screams)
		COME BACK, MOTHERFUCKER!!

EXT.  THE JET, RACHEL'S POV

It starts to swing back to pick her up.

EXT.  RACHEL

PASCOW appears behind her and puts a hand on her shoulder.

				PASCOW
		You're doing just fine.

EXT.  JUD CRANDALL, ON HIS PORCH

He's fast asleep with the tinny sound of Graham Parker coming out 
of his Walkman 'phones.

SOUND: An approaching car.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE

The station wagon turns in and parks. LOUIS gets out. He opens the 
back, removes the body in the tarp and the duffle bag filled with 
tools. He manages to get everything together and walks to the edge 
of the path. He looks at:

EXT.  THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY, LOUIS'S POV

Off it goes, glimmering in the dark.

EXT.  LOUIS

He holds the corpse of his little boy to him.

				LOUIS
		Please God--let this work.

He sets off.

EXT.  JUD, ON HIS PORCH

Zonked out. He missed the whole thing. Nice going, Jud.

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE ARCH TO THE PET SEMATARY, WITH LOUIS

Louis passes under like a ghost.

EXT.  THE PET SEMATARY, WITH LOUIS

LOUIS is crying. He crosses to the deadfall.

				LOUIS
		Ain't gonna stop, Gage. Ain't
		gonna look down.

He begins to mount the deadfall.

EXT.  LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE

He reaches the top. And woven into the deadfall, behind him, 
facing the Pet Sematary, is that snarling face.

LOUIS descends the other side.

EXT.  THE FOOT OF THE DEDFALL, WOODS SIDE

LOUIS reaches the bottom and looks at:

EXT.  THE WOODS, LOUIS'S POV

The path winds onward through those gigantic trees--it glows 
slightly.

EXT.  LOUIS, MOVING UP THE PATH

EXT.  LOUIS, AT THE EDGE OF LITTLE GOD SWAMP

That phosphorescent glow is a lot more pronounced. SOUNDS of 
CRICKETS and FROGS. The water is mucky and still. Hummocks stick 
up like knobs on the back of a creature best not seen. Fog drifts 
through the dead trees. LOUIS doesn't want to go in there. Smart 
man. I wouldn't either.

But he does.

INT.  THE HERTZ DESK, AT BIA WITH RACHEL AND CLERK--AND PASCOW

PASCOW is lounging back against the rack of folders--and getting 
some of them bloody.

				HERTZ CLERK
		I'm sorry...it's been very busy
		tonight. I really don't have
		anything.

				PASCOW
		What about the Aries K with the
		scratch on the side?

The CLERK starts looking through her papers.

				CLERK
		I do have an Aries K, but it came
		in sort of beat up--there's a long
		scrape up one side--

				RACHEL
		I'll take it.

EXT.  LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP

He comes walking toward THE CAMERA with GAGE in his arms and the 
duffle bag over his shoulder. Mist swirls around him. The 
landscape is weird, surreal. CRICKET SOUNDS, AMPLIFIED. In fact 
there are a lot of swampy, marshy SOUNDS--too many. It sounds 
almost prehistoric.

SOUND: HARSH, SCREAMING LAUGHTER

LOUIS stops. He looks slowly around at:

EXT.  MIST-FACE, LOUIS'S POV

A demonic face takes shape in the mist and FLOATS SLOWLY TOWARD 
THE CAMERA. It runs out a tongue that's about nine feet long.

Its eyes blow out. Blood and thick, gooey stuff runs from the 
sockets.

EXT.  LOUIS

He closes his eyes. After a moment he opens them.

EXT.  LITTLE GOD SWAMP, LOUIS'S POV

Nothing there.

EXT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS
		See? Just imagination. Just--

EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET

We can barely see them because they are thick in mist, but he is 
standing on a couple of low, marshy tussocks. Suddenly a thick 
tentacle slimes its way out of the standing water and slithers 
around his ankle.

EXT.  LOUIS, LOOKING DOWN

				LOUIS
		Nothing...there.

He turns around and begins to walk again.

EXT.  LOUIS'S FEET

The tentacle falls away.

EXT.  LOUIS, IN LITTLE GOD SWAMP

MYRIAD SOUNDS, none of them pleasant--laughter, gobbling howls, 
screams. Sounds like the swamp has been invaded by a pack of 
escaped lunatics. LOUIS continues on regardless.

EXT.  WOODS

LOUIS comes into the frame. He's obviously tiring now, but he 
keeps moving along.

SOUND: Approaching footsteps. Big ones. Thudding ones. Something 
is coming which sounds approximately the size of a Tyrannosaurus 
Rex. And it just keeps getting louder and louder and louder. LOUIS 
looks plenty scared.

SOUND: A falling tree.

EXT.  WOODS, LOUIS'S POV

Those SOUNDS keep getting closer and closer. Another tree falls--
we see this one. And now we see a SHAPE--just a SHAPE.

EXT.  LOUIS

He's scared almost to death. His face turns up...up...up.

EXT.  THE WOODS--AND THE SHAPE, LOUIS'S POV

It is vaguely manlike: perhaps sixty feet tall, perhaps eighty. We 
don't see it very well, nor do we have to--I'm not even sure it's 
flesh and blood. But there is a clear suggestion of a head. Now it 
turns and looks down...looks at LOUIS CREED. We see great yellow 
eyes the size of lighthouse lamps.

It makes a huge GRUNTING SOUND...and then walks on.

EXT.  LOUIS

The SOUND OF FOOTFALLS is slowly diminishing.

				LOUIS
		It was the Wendigo. Dear God, I
		think the Wendigo just passed
		within sixty feet of me.

Slowly he begins to walk again.

EXT.  LOUIS, A NEW ANGLE

In the extreme f.g. is a tree which has just fallen--it is no 
small tree, either, but a great big old fir.

LOUIS approaches it. Stops. Looks at the tree. Looks down at:

EXT.  THE FOREST FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV

Here is a gigantic animal track--if it was full of water, LOUIS 
could swim in it. It looks like no animal track we've ever seen 
before. Three big claws at the end of it.

EXT.  LOUIS

Looks up again. His face is set and hard.

				LOUIS
		It doesn't matter. Come on, Gage.

He starts to walk again.

EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND

SOUND: The wind, lonesome and keening.

THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY toward the slope, dreaming its way over 
those rocky cairns...most of them burst apart.

SOUND: Tortured breathing. Panting.

LOUIS toils his way into view, carrying his bundle. He reaches the 
top. He makes his way slowly into the burying ground. He stumbles 
over a rock. Falls down. Slowly gathers his things together and 
gets up again. He goes a little further and then stops and looks 
at:

EXT.  A BROKEN CAIRN AND THE GRAVE BENEATH, LOUIS'S POV

We can also see the shredded remains of a green garbage bag.

EXT.  LOUIS

He slowly kneels down. He puts the canvas tarp to one side and 
slowly takes the pick and shovel from the duffle bag. By now he is 
clearly a man approaching total exhaustion.

EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH AN ARIES K

It tracks past THE CAMERA.

INT.  THE ARIES K WITH RACHEL AND PASCOW

Both of them look tense. RACHEL is bolt upright behind the wheel. 
Suddenly, BANG! as one of the tires blow.

EXT.  THE ARIES K

It goes skidding and slueing across the road, the rear tire half 
off the rim. IT climbs the curb and hits a tree.

INT.  RACHEL

She lurches forward, but she's wearing her seat-belt--good girl! 
She unbuckles it and gets out.

EXT.  RACHEL

She looks at the car, which now has quite a bit more wrong with it 
than just a scratch up the side.

RACHEL slumps, near tears. LOUIS isn't the only one who's been 
through a lot tonight.

				RACHEL
		Now what?

PASCOW comes from around the tree as RACHEL walks to the road, 
looking for cars, or something. He looks urgent and upset.

				PASCOW
		It's trying to stop you. Do you
		hear me? It's trying to stop you.

RACHEL looks around uncertainly...a little afraid. As she scans 
the scene she looks at--and through--PASCOW.

				RACHEL
		Is anyone there?

After a moment of silence she turns back to the road. Lights 
appear and brighten as a car approaches. RACHEL steps to the 
shoulder and after a moment she sticks out her thumb, surely for 
the first time in her life.

The car sweeps by her without slowing.

EXT.  GAGE'S CAIRN, CU

LOUIS'S hands enter the shot and put a few more rocks on it. THE 
CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see him surveying his work. Beside him is 
the canvas tarp, now open and empty.

Absently, LOUIS stuffs the tarp into the duffle bag (where his 
tools have also been replaced) and stands up with a wince. One 
hand goes to his lower back. He looks down at the cairn.

				LOUIS
		Come back to me, Gage. Come back
		to us.

He turns away toward the stairs.

EXT.  RACHEL, ON ROUTE 9

She's walking down the shoulder with her high heels in one hand. 
Lights. An approaching car. She turns, thumb out. The car blasts 
by.

				RACHEL (shouts)
		MAY THE SEWERS OF RANGOON BACK UP
		IN YOUR BEDROOM, ASSHOLE!

She starts walking again.

EXT.  THE FIELD BESIDE LOUIS'S HOUSE

LOUIS is moving down the path. As he passes the tire swing he 
pushes it, setting it in motion.

INT.  THE GARAGE

LOUIS slings the duffle bag wearily to one side and goes into the 
kitchen. CHURCH is under the table but LOUIS Doesn't see him.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL

SOUND of LOUIS slowly plodding up the stairs. He comes into view, 
dirty and exhausted, his hair hanging in his face. He walks down 
the hall toward the master bedroom.

INT.  THE BEDROOM

The clock on the bedtable reads 2:17 A.M. LOUIS falls face-first 
on the immaculate bedspread and lies still.

In this shot we should note the closet door is standing open.

EXT.  THE MICMAC BURYING GROUND, FEATURING GAGE'S CAIRN

THE CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY. Holds. Nothing for a beat. Then:

A small white hand slams up through the rocks, hopefully scaring 
the living shit out of us.

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER as the hand begins to feel around. It takes 
one of the rocks and pushes it aside. Another. Another. Another.

The SOUNDS are not encouraging. It is GRUNTING and GROWLING. There 
is nothing human here.

Rocks begin to tumble as GAGE starts to come out of his grave.

INT.  THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

Fast asleep on the coverlet in his dirty jeans and black sweater.

EXT.  RACHEL

My babe is still takin' a hike. But here comes another vehicle.

EXT.  THE DEADFALL IN THE PET SEMATARY

THE CAMERA MOVES IN on that snarling face.

SOUNDS: GAGE coming. Dead dry breath. Low snarling noises.

Now we see small feet in dirty black shoes walking down the 
deadfall.

EXT.  RACHEL

Suddenly, as the lights appear, she does a Claudette Colbert, 
pulling her skirt up and exhibiting a very lovely leg.

Lights--it's an Orinco truck, naturally--spotlight her. The truck 
stops.

EXT.  RACHEL AND THE TRUCK

The driver leans over and opens the door.

				DRIVER
		Hop in, baby.

				RACHEL
		Thank you.

She does.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN, WITH CHURCH

He's under the kitchen table, green eyes gleaming. I think he 
loves dead, hates living.

SOUND: The doorlatch. CHURCH MIAOWS.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, A NEW (LOW) ANGLE

GAGE'S shoes grit slowly across the linoleum, leaving dirty 
tracks. CHURCH turns to watch GAGE'S passage, and then follows.

INT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

CAMERA HOLDS ON LOUIS as those gritting footsteps approach. Then 
we pan to the closet. On the floor is LOUIS'S little black bag. We 
hold on this as the footfalls near. A small white hand enters the 
frame and pulls the doctor-bag out of the closet. Now another hand 
enters the frame and opens the bag. The hands search around inside 
and bring out a scalpel.

They hold it up. The GAGE-THING makes a contented SOUND.

EXT.  THE ORINCO TRUCK, ON ROUTE 9  NIGHT

It sweeps past THE CAMERA

INT.  THE CAB, WITH RACHEL AND DRIVER

				RACHEL
		Can't you go any faster?

				TRUCKER
		Lady, I got nine points on my
		license right now.

				RACHEL
		I understand. It's just that--

She looks at him, pleading. The TRUCKER speeds up.

				RACHEL
		Thank you. If you only understood
		how important this is--

				TRUCKER
		That's all right, babe. Only if we
		get stopped, next time I'll be the
		one hitchin' and you can give me a
		ride.

EXT.  JUD, ON HIS PORCH

More deeply asleep than ever. Suddenly, from inside, comes the 
sound of Quiet Riot singing/screaming "Bang Your Head." It's the 
stereo, and boy, is it cranked.

JUD straightens up so suddenly he almost falls off his chair. His 
hands go first to his earphones--his first thought on waking is 
that it's coming from there--and then he hurries inside.

CAMERA PANS DOWN to small muddy tracks on the porch floor.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JUD

He hurries in, turns on the light, and rushes across to his stereo 
system, which is state-of-the-art digital--it looks like a flying 
saucer among the more traditional furnishings of the room. He 
shuts it off and looks around, frowning.

SOUND: Todd Rundgren, singing "Bang on the Drum All Day" at the 
top of his voice.

JUD'S head snaps toward the SOUND.

INT.  A SONY RADIO, CU

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as JUD hurries across the kitchen to the 
counter, where the radio is. He turns it off, looking around, more 
bewildered than ever.

				JUD (sharply)
		Who's here?

He walks toward the door which gives on the hall.

INT.  THE HALL, WITH JUD

It's dimly lit by light-spill from the living room and kitchen.

				JUD
		Come on, stop playing games!

SOUND: Molly Hatchet, "Flirtin' with Disaster," being played top 
end, from upstairs.

JUD hurries up. Let me suggest that there is a certain psychology 
at work here--for the moment he's more concerned about waking the 
neighborhood with all this high-decible rock and roll than with 
the prowler...and he would certainly know who--or what--that 
prowler was, if he had time to think.

INT.  JUD'S BEDROOM

He enters and turns on the light. We see a portable phonograph 
with the record, turning. JUD rushes over and turns it off.

He looks around, and we see by his face that he knows.

				JUD
		Gage? (Pause) Are you the one
		playing games?

He goes to the window and looks out at:

INT./EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE, WITH THE STATION WAGON, JUD'S POV

INT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH JUD

He turns slowly and walks toward the bed.

				JUD
		Gage? Come on out.

He reaches in his pocket and brings out a pocket-knife. He unfolds 
the blade.

				JUD
		I want to show you something.

SOUND: Miaow!

INT.  THE DOORWAY, WITH CHURCH, JUD'S POV

INT.  JUD, BY THE BED

				JUD (to the cat)
		How did you--?!

INT.  JUD'S FEET

A small hand holding a scalpel shoots out from beneath the skirt 
of the coverlet and slashes JUD'S calf,

INT.  JUD

He screams with pain and staggers backward.

INT.  JUD'S FEET

The other hand shoots out. GAGE grabs one of JUD'S ankles and 
pulls.

INT.  JUD

With a startled yell, he falls.

INT.  JUD AND GAGE

This one's gotta be pretty rough. George will know what to do. We 
finally see GAGE, but it should be clear to us that it's not 
really GAGE at all. Some daemonic presence is riding inside the 
mouldering, disfigured shell of GAGE.

There is a struggle. JUD is repeatedly slashed with the scalpel. 
Perhaps he gets GAGE a time or two with the pocketknife.

GAGE screams and gibbers--nothing intelligible here; only sounds.

JUD expires.

GAGE sits on top of him...and then bites into his throat.

EXT.  ROUTE 9, BETWEEN THE CRANDALL AND CREED HOUSES

Headlights. RACHEL'S truck has arrived. It pulls up.

RACHEL opens the passenger door, which is on JUD'S side.

EXT.  ANGLE ON THE CAB

We can see PASCOW sitting in the passenger seat where RACHEL just 
was.

				RACHEL
		Thank you so much.

				TRUCKER
		I didn't get a ticket, so you're
		welcome, lady.
			(And, more seriously)
		Whatever your problems are, I hope
		they work out.

				PASCOW
		It's the end of the line for me,
		too--I'm not allowed any further.

				RACHEL (to the trucker)
		I'm sure things will be fine.

				PASCOW
		I'm not.

She closes the door and steps down.

The truck starts off with a HISS OF RELEASED AIRBRAKES. As it 
pulls past her, RACHEL starts across the road, when:

				GAGE (soft voice)
		Mummy!

She stops, startled. Her face wears a "did I hear that?" 
expression. She looks back toward JUD'S house.

				GAGE (soft voice)
		Mummy!

RACHEL walks halfway up JUD'S paved walk and looks at:

EXT.  JUD'S HOUSE, RACHEL'S POV

The one place in the whole world we do not want RACHEL to go.

EXT.  RACHEL

She goes. Up the steps to the porch. All through this she's been 
travelling with two bags: her handbag and a light tote with her 
initials on it. Now she sets the tote down on the top step and 
opens the porch door.

She looks very uncertain. This is the wee hours of the morning, 
and someone else's house. But...that voice...

				GAGE (voice)
		Mummy, I need you!

RACHEL looks stunned--rocked. She steps onto the porch.

				RACHEL
		Who--

The door to the house swings open. After a moment CHURCH comes 
into the doorway and sits down.

				CHURCH
		Miaow!

				RACHEL
		Church!

				GAGE (voice)
		Mummy, I need you!

She crosses to the open door.

				RACHEL
		Gage? Gage?

No answer. RACHEL steps in.

EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  MORNING

INT.  THE CREED BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

He's restless, having a very bad dream, from the look. He rolls 
back and forth. Closer and closer to the edge. Finally, with a 
wild yell, he goes over onto the floor.

INT.  LOUIS, ON THE FLOOR

He comes awake. Sits up. Ouch! He's aches from top to bottom and 
side to side...but his back is worst. His hands go to it.

				LOUIS
		Jesus!

He starts to get up very slowly, and this his eyes fix on:

INT.  GAGE'S TRACKS ON THE BEDROOM FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV

They enter the house, go to the closet, then leave again.

INT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS
		Gage--?

He scrambles for the closet, his aches and pains forgotten. He 
stares in wildly.

INT.  THE DOCTOR-BAG

It's open.

INT.  LOUIS

He pulls the doctor-bag out. His original hope is now tempered 
with the first signs of fear. He begins to go through the doctor-
bag. Suddenly he brings out a case and opens it. The case is 
empty, but the indented shape is clear. There was a scalpel in 
this case...but not anymore.

				LOUIS
		Oh my God. (Pause) Gage!

INT.  THE HALL, WITH LOUIS

				LOUIS
		Gage!

LOUIS stands there, tensely listening, for a moment or two, but 
there's only silence. He rushes down the hallway and opens the 
door to GAGE'S room.

INT.  GAGE'S ROOM, LOUIS'S POV

Empty.

INT.  LOUIS, ON THE STAIRS

He goes downstairs, yelling GAGE'S name.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS

Nothing. The phone RINGS. LOUIS almost jumps out of his skin 
reaching for it.

				LOUIS
		Hello!

				IRWIN (voice)
		Hello, Louis--it's Irwin.
		I just wanted to be sure Rachel
		got back all right.

As IRWIN says this, LOUIS'S eyes fix upon something.

INT.  THE FLOOR, WITH TWO SETS OF GAGE-TRACKS, LOUIS'S POV

One set comes in from the shed-garage and heads for the parlor and 
upstairs. The other comes out of the parlor and crosses to the 
kitchen door giving directly on the outside.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS

In his eyes we suddenly see that he understands everything...or 
almost everything.

				IRWIN (voice)
		Louis...are you there?

				LOUIS (slowly)
		Yes--I'm here.

				IRWIN (voice)
		Did she get there all right?

				LOUIS
		Yes, she's fine.

				IRWIN (voice)
		Well, put her on at that end and
		I'll put Ellie on at this one.
		Ellie's very worried about her
		mother. (Pause) She's almost
		in hysterics.

				LOUIS
		She...Rachel's asleep.

				IRWIN (an edge in his voice now)
		Then I suggest you wake her up.
		Ellie...I think she had a dream that
		her mother was dead.

				LOUIS
		I'll call you right back.

				IRWIN (voice)
		Louis--!

But LOUIS, whose last few responses have been almost trancelike, 
hangs up. He looks at the tracks, then goes into the parlor.

INT.  THE CRANDALL LIVING ROOM, WITH THE PHONE

Tiny bloody hands lift it off the cradle. A tiny bloody finger 
dials.

INT.  THE CREED KITCHEN

The phone starts to ring. After two or three ringy-dingys, LOUIS, 
looking extremely upset, comes out of the parlor and picks it up.

				LOUIS
		Irwin, you'll just have to--				

				GAGE (voice)
		I'm at Jud's, daddy. Will you come
		over and play with me?

LOUIS is dumbfounded...slack-mouthed with terror.

				LOUIS (a bare whisper)
		Gage?

				GAGE (voice)
		Mommy already came. We played, daddy.
		First I played with Jud and then mommy
		came and I played with mommy. We had
		an awful good time. Now I want to play
		with you.

GAGE begins to giggle...a really awful sound.

				LOUIS
		What did you do? What did you--

CLICK! The GAGE-THING hangs up, still giggling.

INT.  THE CREED BED, CU

He puts the doctor-bag down on the bed and roots through it. He 
comes up with three syringes, still wrapped in paper, and puts 
them aside. Then he roots around some more and comes up with 
several ampoules. He holds one up for inspection and we can read 
the word MORPHINE on it very clearly.

INT.  THE BEDROOM, WITH LOUIS

He carries the syringes and ampoules of morphine over to the 
window. His hair has gone partially white.

He fills all three syringes with morphine (using two ampoules for 
each syringe--i.e., enough to kill a polar bear) and puts them in 
the left breast pocket of his shirt. He puts the spare ampoules in 
the right breast pocket of his shirt.

LOUIS is slowly going insane. What remains of his rationality is 
like a rapidly fraying rope.

				LOUIS
		What you buy is what you own, and
		sooner or later what you own comes
		home to you. Wasn't that what you
		said, Jud? Wasn't that pretty much it?

He leaves the room.

EXT.  THE FRONT DOOR OF THE CREED HOUSE

LOUIS comes out the door. In one hand he's got a raw pork chop. In 
the other he is carrying a pair of Playtex rubber gloves. He walks 
to the soft shoulder and waits for an Orinco truck to pass. Then 
he crosses.

EXT.  THE CRANDALL WALK, WITH LOUIS

He walks most of the way to the house, then stops.

EXT.  CHURCH, LOUIS"S POV

He gets up, humping his back warily.

EXT.  LOUIS

				LOUIS
		Hi, Church. Want some grub?

He tosses the pork chop onto the grass.

EXT.  CHURCH

He hurries down the steps, goes to the chop, sniffs it, and starts 
to chow up. He looks up at:

EXT.  LOUIS

He is pulling on the rubber gloves.

				LOUIS
		Don't mind me. Eat it while you can.
		Eat all you want.

EXT.  CHURCH

He starts worrying the chop again. Smack-smack-smack.

EXT.  ANGLE ON LOUIS AND CHURCH

				LOUIS
		Eat all you can...all you want...
		that's right...today's Thanksgiving
		day for cats, but only if they came
		back from the dead...

He finishes with the gloves, gets one of the loaded syringes out 
of his breast pocket, holds it up, squirts a drop out of the tip, 
then moves toward CHURCH.

CHURCH looks up. LOUIS stops moving. CHURCH starts eating again, 
and LOUIS starts moving again as soon as he does. All the time he 
talks to the cat in that soothing voice. He bends down...and grabs 
him.

CHURCH begins to squall and fight. LOUIS holds onto him. He tries 
to get the syringe into the cat and CHURCH almost gets away.

				LOUIS
		No, you don't!

EXT.  CHURCH, CU

The syringe plunges into his haunch.

EXT.  CHURCH AND LOUIS

The needle is still dangling out of CHURCH'S haunch. The cat looks 
dazed. It tries to walk and falls over on its side. It tries to 
get up...and then falls over again.

				LOUIS
		Go on. Lie down. Play dead. Be dead.

He walks to the porch steps and picks up the tote-bag.

EXT.  THE TOTE-BAG, LOUIS'S POV

Any doubt he might have allowed himself the luxury of having is 
erased by the initials--R.C., same as the cola.

EXT.  LOUIS

Twang! One of the few remaining strands of sanity has now parted. 
He looks back at:

INT.  CHURCH, ON THE PATH, LOUIS'S POV

Dead.

EXT.  LOUIS

He climbs the steps and goes onto the porch.

EXT. LOUIS, ON THE PORCH

He strips off the rubber gloves. He tosses them onto the table 
beside JUD'S beer-cans as he goes inside.

INT.  THE FOYER OF THE CRANDALL HOME, WITH LOUIS

It's dark in here, and spooky.

				LOUIS
		Rachel? (Pause) Jud? (Longer pause)
		Gage?

No answer. He looks down and sees:

INT.  A SHOE, LOUIS'S POV

One of RACHEL'S shoes. It lies by the foot of the stairs.

INT.  LOUIS

He goes over and picks up the shoe. It's a three-quarter heel, and 
it's pretty badly scuffed. RACHEL, after all, did some pretty hard 
travelling to get here.

There's a spot of blood on it.

SOUND: A low giggle.

LOUIS looks up:

INT.  THE STAIRS, LOUIS'S POV

Mighty dark. Mighty shadowy.

SOUND: Another giggle.

INT.  LOUIS, AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS

				LOUIS
		Gage?

INT.  THE STAIRS

				GAGE (voice)
		Let's play, daddy! Let's play hide
		and go seek!

INT.  LOUIS

He takes one of the loaded syringes from his pocket.

				LOUIS
		All right, Gage...let's.

He begins to climb the stairs.

INT.  UPSTAIRS, WITH LOUIS

LOUIS arrives on the landing. We begin the nerve-wracking business 
of checking rooms. First, the bathroom...and the shower curtain is 
of course pulled. LOUIS yanks it back. Nothing.

He checks the linen closet. Nothing. Goes back to the hall. Looks 
down it. He walks slowly along it. He checks one room. It's a 
guest room. Shadowy and empty.

Down the hall. A closet door. A bag falls off the top shelf, and a 
bunch of ceramics inside it SHATTER LOUDLY. LOUIS flinches back.

Down the hall. Now he's at JUD'S room. He goes in.

INT.  JUD'S ROOM, WITH LOUIS

He checks the closet. No go. He steps around the bed and sees:

INT.  THE FLOOR, LOUIS'S POV

A bloodstain.

INT.  LOUIS

He gets down on his hands and knees and examines the bloodstain. 
He sees the skirt on the bedspread. He lifts it. He is nose to 
nose with JUD, who is dead with his eyes open, an expression of 
incredible horror on his face.

The DOOR SLAMS.

LOUIS bolts to his feet as GIGGLES fade down the hall.

Slowly, he kneels down and speaks to the skirt of the spread, 
which has mercifully fallen back into place.

				LOUIS
		I'm sorry, Jud. I'm so sorry. I'm--

There's a SQUEAKING, SQUEALING SOUND.

LOUIS turns around. He gets up again. He starts for the door. Then 
he turns back and speaks to JUD again.

				LOUIS
		I'm going to set things back in
		order. I...I know just what to do.

He goes out.

INT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH LOUIS

He takes one of the two remaining loaded syringes from his breast 
pocket.

				LOUIS
		Gage?

Another SQUEAKING SOUND. And another GIGGLE.

LOUIS starts slowly forward. He gets about halfway down the hall--
and our nerves are tuned to the breaking point--when there is a 
SQUEALING CREAK and a GRATING THUMP from overhead.

INT.  CEILING TRAPDOOR

This happens fast. The trap--which presumably gives on the attic 
with a set of folding stairs--rises, and RACHEL'S body plunges 
down through and then hangs, swinging: she has been bound around 
the armpits and as become a grotesque parody of MISSY DANDRIDGE.

Half her face is gone. Eaten.

INT.  LOUIS

He SCREAMS and backs against the wall. Twang! The last silver 
thread parts.

INT.  THE TRAPDOOR, WITH GAGE

He leaps down, crashes on the floor, and then picks himself up. He 
is waving the scalpel.

				GAGE (screeching)
		Allee-allee-in-free! allee-allee-
		in-free! Allee-allee-in-free!

INT.  LOUIS AND GAGE

I won't choreograph all the moves, but GAGE slashes his stunned 
father up pretty badly with the scalpel. He's screeching the whole 
time. LOUIS finally begins to react. He grapples with the little 
critter, and tries to get the syringe into him. No good. It's 
batted out of his hand just before he can do it. It breaks.

LOUIS and GAGE fall to the floor. LOUIS gets the other syringe out 
of his pocket, but it's also knocked out of his hand. Only 
consolation is this one isn't broken. It rolls off along the 
floor. LOUIS finally manages to get it again as the struggle goes 
on, and plunges it into GAGE'S neck.

				GAGE
		No fair! NO FAIR!

He gets to his feet, clawing for the needle lolling out of his 
neck. He's lost all interest in his father. He goes staggering 
away. He's slowing down. He goes to his knees...and falls on his 
face.

LOUIS watches this... and then his vacant, half-catatonic gaze 
goes to:

INT.  RACHEL, LOUIS'S POV

She swings slowly back and forth.

EXT.  THE BACK YARD OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE

Time has passed. It's late afternoon. LOUIS comes out with a 
sheet-wrapped form in his arms. RACHEL, of course.

He sets the body down and goes back inside.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOUIS

He's splashing around a can of coal-oil. When he's got the room 
wetted down to his satisfaction, he goes to the door, lights a 
match, and tosses it.

Flame runs across the floor. The fire is slow at first, but then 
it begins to gain rapidly.

LOUIS goes out.

EXT.  THE BACK LAWN, WITH LOUIS

He picks up the sheet-wrapped form of his wife and walks around 
the side of the house as flames shoot through the kitchen windows.

EXT.  THE FRONT OF THE CRANDALL HOUSE, FROM ACROSS THE ROAD

LOUIS appears with his shrouded burden and approaches the road.

FADE IN:

INT.  LEMARCHE CASTLE, TOMB - NIGHT (1865)

A storm is raging outside. We hear the clap and roll of THUNDER.

TOMB STAIRWAY -

RATS scurry away down the scum-covered steps as the GLOW OF A 
LANTERN and FOOTSTEPS herald someone's arrival...

GENVIEVE LEMARCHE

emerges around the bend. Mid-30s. Cultured beauty. Her dress and 
face are smeared with grime and... is that blood we see too? God 
only knows what's happened to her.

Genvieve ducks under a monstrous cobweb as she passes an open 
window.

WINDOW

LIGHTNING streaks across the night sky outside. We catch a glimpse 
of the MOON disappearing behind the clouds.

Genvieve reaches the bottom of the stairs. The tomb itself.

Water trickles in through cracks in the lichen-covered walls, 
pooling on the tomb floor.

Genvieve moves forward, her lantern throwing distorted shadows 
over everything...

In front of her is Anton LeMarche's stone sarcophagus.
Genvieve kneels in the water, one hand resting on the spiked iron 
railing which surrounds the tomb. She reaches the other hand 
towards a scum-covered plaque, brushing the grime away...

THUNDER and LIGHTNING reach a crescendo as...

A SKELETAL HAND rises out of the water, reaching for her.

Genvieve SCREAMS. The lantern falls from her grasp, sputtering 
out. The hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her 
breast instead...

Genvieve starts to laugh hysterically.

				DIRECTOR (O.S.)
			(exasperated)
		Cut! Thank you, Renee. Can we
		throw some light on the set?

				GENVIEVE
		I'm sorry...

Suddenly it is lighter. Genvieve can't stop laughing. The groping 
monster hand disappears back beneath the water.

WE PULL BACK, REVEALING -

It's not 1865. The LeMarche Castle tomb is in fact, a 90s movie 
set. We are inside a soundstage, on a raised set, so the slugline 
should really read...

INT.  SOUNDSTAGE, LEMARCHE CASTLE TOMB SET -

A FILM CREW scurries about. Everyone is LAUGHING now. The DIRECTOR 
sits to the right. He and the DP are already huddled over the 
video-assist monitor. We see the previous scene rewinding at high-
speed.

The FIRST A.D. moves in.

				FIRST A.D.
		Water in the pool's running low,
		fill her up!

Crewmembers move towards the set.

An SFX PUPPETEER (i.e., the skeletal arm) crawls out from under, 
followed by an ELECTRICIAN.

				PUPPETEER
		I can't see shit down there! I'm
		working blind!

GENVIEVE/THE ACTRESS

rises out of the water. Her name is actually RENEE HALLOW and her 
beauty is undeniable, even in such a disheveled state.

				RENEE
		This is great, I could've spent
		four months on a romantic comedy
		with Warren Beatty, and instead,
		I've got a horny zombie trying to
		cop a feel!

The crew members LAUGH. She's well-liked on the set. Renee grins. 
Wardrobe and make-up personnel move in to adjust Renee's 
appearance.

				RENEE
		Uhgh, there's water everywhere...
			(beat)
		Can I get a cigarette?

The MAKE-UP GIRL pulls a pack of cigarettes from her fanny-pack 
and offers Renee one. In a flash, a P.A. appears with a lighter. 
Renee mumbles "thanks" as she fires up. She squints her eyes, 
trying to see past the set lights.

				RENEE
			(calling out)
		Geoff?
			(beat)
		Anybody see my boy?

				GEOFF (O.S.)
		Right here, Mom...

GEOFF MATTHEWS, Renee's 12 year-old son steps into view. Renee's 
face lights up when she sees him.

				RENEE
		How long have you been here?

				GEOFF
		Couple minutes. I saw the last
		shot. That was pretty cool.

Renee grimaces as the make-up girl spritzes her face with a spray-
bottle.

				RENEE
			(casually)
		How did it go with your father
		last night?

				GEOFF
		Good. He said he'd be over for
		dinner at eight...
			(awkward)
		I mean... he misses you, Mom...

				RENEE
		I miss him too...

				RENEE
			(continuing)
		I just don't want you to get your
		hopes up, okay? We're trying to
		work things out, but...

Her voice trails off.

				GEOFF
		I know, Mom.

				RENEE
			(affectionate)
		You know everything, don't you?

Renee and Geoff are interrupted by a CREWMEMBER who's spraying 
"atmosphere" about the set with a hand-held smoke machine. Renee 
coughs.

Off-set, the FIRST A.D. is trying to get the show on the road.

				FIRST A.D.
		Okay, people! Quiet! We're going
		to try this another time!

				GEOFF
		Guess it's showtime.

				RENEE
		Yep.

Renee kisses Geoff on the forehead. He takes the cigarette from 
her and moves off the set, standing near the camera.

The director turns back toward Renee.

				DIRECTOR
		Alright, Renee. Last time. I
		promise. We nail this and you
		won't have to do this ever again.

				RENEE
		That's what you said the first
		time...

Renee turns and heads back toward the stairs. A P.A. hands her a 
new lantern. As she reaches the stairs, the house lights dim, 
creating the proper atmosphere once again.

UNDER THE SET -

The puppeteer gets ready. It's cramped. The electrician checks a 
power box connection.

The director nods to the camera operator.

				OPERATOR
		Rolling. Speed...

				SLATE BOY
		"Castle of Terror." Scene 69A.
		Take thirteen.

The slate comes down.

				DIRECTOR
		Action!

The scene replays itself as before, only now we're watching the 
action from multiple viewpoints.

We start on the video assist monitor, then move up to...

GEOFF

He grins as he watches the scene unfold.

ON THE SET

Renee has reached the sarcophagus. LIGHTNING flashes. The skeleton 
hand bursts up, grabbing Renee's arm. The scene continues past the 
original point of interruption.

UNDER THE SET -

We see an undetected LEAK. Water drips down. The puppeteer shifts 
position, struggling, and...

...knocks over the power box which SPARKS just as...

ABOVE -

Renee/Genvieve grabs the iron railing with both hands.

Electricity surges through Renee. Her body jerks and writhes like 
some nightmarish marionette.

UNDER THE SET -

The electrician drags the puppeteer back. Sparks fly.

				ELECTRICIAN
		Jesus! We've crossed over into
		220! Shut down the generator!

ABOVE -

Crewmembers SCREAM and scramble back...

All the circuits are blowing, lights EXPLODING and showering 
sparks over the whole set. This is not part of the movie.

RENEE

It's awful. She shakes, her SMOKING HANDS frozen to the iron 
railing by the electricity running through her...

Suddenly, Renee falls forward against the iron. Her face begins to 
SMOKE AND SINGE...

The lights CONTINUE TO BLOW, casting a strobic effect over the 
soundstage, adding to the chaos.

ON GEOFF

As he witnesses the whole event. He tries to rush forward, but 
someone restrains him...

				GEOFF
		Mom!!!!

Suddenly all the circuits in the stage are blown and the LIGHTS GO 
OUT. Renee slumps back into the water, smoke trailing up from her 
still form. And we...

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY

An aged GOLDEN RETRIEVER is on the surgical table. CHASE MATTHEWS, 
D.V.M., gently strokes the dog's fur. He's good with the dog. He's 
kind. The retriever's owners: a MOTHER and her SON, look on.

				CHASE
		I think this is probably for the
		best. He's a very old dog. He
		has arthritis. He has cataracts
		in his eyes...

Chase looks at the mother. He's always hated this part.

				CHASE
		He's had a good life...
			(to dog)
		...haven't you, boy?

				INTERCOM
		Doctor Matthews, your son is on
		line one. He says it's an
		emergency...

Chase breaks concentration, pulling his eyes away from the mother 
and son.

INT.  SOUNDSTAGE, LEMARCHE CASTLE TOMB SET -

A blur of activity converges on the movie set. A TRIO OF 
PARAMEDICS. A FIRE OFFICIAL. A POLICE OFFICER. Medical equipment. 
Horrified crewmembers watch on, helpless.

WE STAY ON Geoff, momentarily blocked out and then revealed again 
and again, amidst the commotion of paramedics scrambling to save 
Renee. The director has his hand on Geoff's shoulder.

Geoff's eyes dart about, taking it all in. Things are happening 
very fast:

--Renee's hand is lifted. Someone checking her pulse. --Her 
eyelids parted. A pen light flashing at her fixed pupils.

				PARAMEDIC #1 (O.S.)
		Run me down a line of normal
		saline.

--An I.V. needle plunges into the inside of Renee's elbow. --A 
syringe injects into the I.V. post.

--Hands hook up a life-pack monitor. Renee's dress is torn away. 
Electrodes press to bare skin. --The monitor screen blinks to 
life.

				PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
		We have a bradycardic rhythm at
		30.

--Another PARAMEDIC dials out on a cellular phone, to the 
consulting physician.

				PARAMEDIC #3 (O.S.)
		White female. Approximately
		thirty five years old.
		Electrocution...

--A clear tube is inserted down her throat. --The monitor shows 
erratic heartbeat.

				PARAMEDIC #2 (O.S.)
		She's in V-fib.

--There's a renewed urgency even amidst their rush.

--Defibrillator paddles are pressed to her chest.

Geoff looks to the monitor as...

--It goes to flatline.

				PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
		Clear.

				GEOFF
		No...

Geoff moves forward, pulling away from the director. The police 
officer moves in and intercepts Geoff, turning the boy away.

Geoff's eyes fix on the monitor. An unbending flatline...

				GEOFF
		You have to bring her back...

Chase rushes onto the set, pushing past crewmembers. He freezes at 
the sight of the horrific commotion around Renee's still form.

				CHASE
		Oh Jesus...

Chase's gaze connects with his son.

				GEOFF
			(helpless)
		Dad...

We pull back from Geoff, Chase, and the commotion around Renee. 
Farther and farther as the darkness around the set begins to close 
in...

				PARAMEDIC #1 (O.S.)
			(urgent)
		We're losing her...

Darkness everywhere and we

EXT.  A DREAMLIKE FOG

A form drifts forward, materializing out of the fog.

It's a CASKET. Appearing as if it's floating among the clouds. 
PULLING BACK, WE SEE that it's moving along A CONVEYOR. AND NOW, 
WE CAN make out the faint form of A PLANE as the conveyor descends 
from the cargo compartment.

The casket reaches the end of the conveyor. A tag marks its final 
destination: Bangor, Maine. HANDS reach in and lift the casket. 
FOUR BAGGAGE HANDLERS hoist the casket up onto their shoulders and 
carry it off.

				HANDLER #1
		Is it true she grew up around
		here?

				HANDLER #2
		Yeah. Over in Ludlow.

				HANDLER #1
		Huh. Never met a movie star
		before.

				HANDLER #3
		Well you're a little late for an
		autograph.

The baggage handlers laugh as they walk off into the distance. The 
fog closes around them and we...

								DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  PLEASANTVILLE CEMETERY - DAY

We drift down from the gray sky to the somber scene below. Off in 
the distance, a crowd of MOURNERS are gathered around a grave.

				PRIEST (V.O.)
		...I am the resurrection and the
		life, saith the Lord...

CLOSER -

THE HEADSTONE is adorned with an iron plaque. It reads, simply:

			RENEE HALLOW MATTHEWS
				1955-1991

				PRIEST (V.O.)
		...She that believeth in me,
		though she were dead, yet shall
		she live; and whosoever liveth and
		believeth in me, shall never
		die...

THE CASKET is slowly lowered into the open grave. As it descends, 
WE SEE Geoff and his father, Chase, standing at the forefront of 
the crowd. Renee's grave is next to those of her parents.

Among the mourners is MARJORIE HARGROVE, an attractive local girl 
in her early twenties.

Further down the hillside, a wall of NEWS REPORTERS are gathered 
behind a roped-off media boundary. There is a blinding flurry of 
PHOTO FLASHES as the press records the scene before them.

A SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PATROL CAR cruises up the cemetery drive, 
pulling to a stop near the mob of reporters.

Out of the car steps GUS GILBERT. Gus is nearly forty, with a 
Sheriff's uniform fitted to his solid, ageless frame. Gruff, maybe 
a little self-important: Gus likes being a big fish in a small 
pond.

				GUS
			(drawing near)
		Let's keep it back, folks.
		Try to show her a little
		respect...

A REPORTER ducks under the media boundary, moving in for a closer 
shot.

He doesn't make it two steps before he's intercepted by Gus. Gus 
grabs the reporter and shoves him back.

				GUS
		Hey! What did I just say?

Gus means business. One look into his eyes reveals his intense, no 
nonsense approach.

				REPORTER
		Ass-hole...

The reporter backs off.

BACK AT THE GRAVESIDE -

Beneath the gloomy, ominous skies, the lines on Chase's face shade 
him as a decade older than his thirty-five years. Chase gently 
places a comforting hand on Geoff's shoulder.

Geoff inches forward, pulling free of Chase's touch. Drawn to his 
mother, drawn from his father. The only blemishes on his youthful, 
rosy cheeks are the tears, the endless tears.

				PRIEST (V.O.)
		I know that my redeemer liveth,
		and that he shall stand at the
		latter day upon the earth.

Geoff looks upon the casket, gazing into the abyss of despair.

FOLLOWING THE CEREMONY

The crowd has dispersed.

Geoff is standing at the base of Renee's grave. His eyes fixed. 
Unmoving. Unaccepting.

Chase is nearby, watching, not wanting to intrude on Geoff's 
private moment.

Gus quietly moves in at Chase's side.

				GUS
		Did she always have reporters
		following her around like this?

				CHASE
		Pretty much so.

Gus glances at Geoff.

				GUS
		I hear you moved into town.

				CHASE
		I wanted to get Geoff out of
		L.A. Just start things over, you
		know?

Gus nods. Now his eyes fall on Renee's headstone.

				GUS
		I remember when Renee left. She
		couldn't wait to get out of
		Ludlow. She used to say that
		life moved too slow here...

Chase forces a smile.

				CHASE
		That's Renee alright.

				GUS
		I suppose so.

The sky above seems heavy with imminent rain and we...

EXT.  HOUSE - DAY

Lazy oaks embrace a vintage, two-story Victorian home in the rural 
neighborhood of Ludlow, Maine. A commercial MOVING VAN is parked 
out front.

Marjorie, the girl we saw at Renee's funeral, is coming down the 
sidewalk. She checks the address on the front of the house, then 
heads up the driveway.

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

Moving boxes clutter the downstairs.

Chase is weaving through the maze, doing an inventory on the 
boxes.

A sweaty PAIR OF MOVERS are climbing up the stairs. Each is 
hunched  over, with a garment box balanced on his back. The side 
of each carton is boldly labeled: RENEE - ATTIC.

				MOVER (O.S.)
		We've got six more of these. You
		sure you want them all in the
		attic?

Chase is contemplating a compromise when Geoff appears from the 
kitchen doorway.

				CHASE
		...Geoff, what if we just give
		the clothes to Goodwill? We'll
		keep the rest. Just the clothes.

Geoff shakes his head, firm and deliberate denial.

				GEOFF
		You're the one who wanted to move.
		Nobody would've touched them if
		you didn't want to move here...

Chase weakens, giving in.

				CHASE
		All the 'Renee' boxes go in the
		attic. Sorry.

Marjorie KNOCKS on the open frame of the front door.

Geoff recognizes her from his mother's funeral. She flashes him a 
warm smile.

				MARJORIE
		Hi. I'm Marjorie Hargrove. Your
		new housekeeper.

Marjorie has a naive, friendly quality about her. She's also 
blessed with eye-popping genetics. Standing there outside the 
door, looking more than a little nervous... we can't help but like 
her. Needless to say, she doesn't look like your typical 
housekeeper.

				MARJORIE
			(re: Chase's reaction)
		Is something wrong?

				CHASE
		Uh... no. You just... look
		different than you sounded on the
		phone. Please, come in.

Marjorie enters. She grins at Geoff again. Yep. She's nervous 
alright.

				MARJORIE
		I'm real excited about working
		for you Mr. Matthews...

				CHASE
		Well we're glad to have you,
		Marjorie. You can call me Chase,
		by the way.

Marjorie passes her curious eyes over one of Renee's garment 
containers.

				MARJORIE
		I've always admired Ms. Hallow.
		That scene she did in Blue
		Midnight, where her lover meets
		her at the train station...
			(she sighs)
		I must've watched that movie four
		times.

Chase smiles. Marjorie's enthusiasm is endearing.

Just then, one of the movers loses his grip. A garment box bounces 
down the slope of the stairs. When it reaches the bottom, dresses 
spill over the floor.

				MARJORIE
		Oh. I'll get that...

Marjorie moves for the spill. The first dress she touches is a 
beaded peach evening gown. Her fingers linger on the fabric.

				MARJORIE
		This is gorgeous. She wore this
		at the Emmys, didn't she?

Geoff moves forward, acting overly defensive.

				GEOFF
		Hey, don't touch her stuff. It
		made her crazy when people touched
		her stuff.

Marjorie is taken aback by the oddity of Geoff's statement.

Chase catches her eye, shrugging apologetically.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY

A VAN is parked outside. The rear side panel is masked off with 
tape and a stencil. Chase grabs the corner of the tape and 
carefully peels it back, revealing a crisp, new business logo:

		ROUND THE CLOCK ANIMAL DOC
		MOBILE VETERINARY SERVICE
		CHASE MATTHEWS, D.V.M.
		Serving Aroostook County

EXT.  TOWN - DAY

ESTABLISHING. Shops and businesses situated around a lazy town 
square. QUiet. Relaxed. As rural as they come.

WE pick up Chase's van as it cruises by.

EXT.  VETERINARY OFFICE - DAY

Chase pulls the van in front of an unassuming veterinary office.

On the door is Chase's nameplate. And on the weathered wall is an 
outline of letters where the name and title "Quentin Yolander, 
Doctor of Veterinary Medicine" once was.

Geoff is first out of the van.

INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Geoff and Chase move inside. The offices look like they were built 
in the 40s. A dark corridor stretches down the center of the 
suite. Faded green walls are solid, with few exteriors. It's 
creepy in here.

Heavy, grey plastic curtains absorb much of the light which does 
find its way in. Nothing looks like it's been updated in the past 
fifty years.

				CHASE
		This doesn't look so bad...

Chase sweeps a curtain aside, revealing the interior to Geoff. 
Dust swirls in the air.

				GEOFF
		How long ago did this guy retire?

				CHASE
		It's been a few years.

Geoff takes a look around, growing uncomfortable.

				GEOFF
			(skeptical)
		A few?

Geoff moves on down the central corridor which seems to grow 
darker and more dismal with every step. He moves on into the 
boarding room...

INT.  BOARDING AREA - DAY

Rows of kennels are stacked along the walls, smothered with 
cobwebs. Ancient, rusted surgical equipment is scattered 
everywhere. The place is a mess. Windows are boarded up and 
shadows cloak the room.

Over to the right, Geoff hears a RUSTLING.

A CARDBOARD BOX on one of the shelves jiggles. Something is moving 
around inside it.

Geoff's eyes widen. Still, morbid curiosity propels him forward.

The box rustles again. He reaches for it and...

A CREATURE LEAPS out at him, HOWLING. Geoff SCREAMS and jumps 
back. The box tumbles over and...

A CAT crawls out. Behind the protective mother, are four of the 
cutest kittens we've ever seen, MEWING away.

Geoff sighs just as Chase rushes into the room.

				CHASE
		What's wrong?!

				GEOFF
			(embarrassed)
		Nothing. I just got spooked by a
		bunch of furballs.

Inside the box is a note. Chase reaches for it. It reads: "And a 
warm welcome to you."

				CHASE
		Great, now I've opened an
		orphanage too.

One of the kittens pads out of the box and looks up at Geoff with 
sleepy eyes. Her fur is striped.

				GEOFF
		Well, I'll take one. If it's
		okay...

Geoff lifts the fragile creature, cradling it in his arms.

				GEOFF
		She looks like a tiger.

Chase spies an old broom resting in the corner.

				CHASE
		Tell you what, you do some
		sweeping up here, and she's yours.

Geoff nods and Chase moves back out into the hallway.

Geoff sets the box back upright and lowers Tiger in with the other 
kittens. He reaches for the broom and goes to work sweeping away 
the cobwebs.

Just as soon as he turns his back, Tiger climbs the side of the 
box, spilling over onto the floor.

INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM

Chase is unpacking a shipment of medical supplies. When he places 
them in the cabinet, he stirs up a layer of dust.

Tiger scampers by as Chase coughs his way out of the cloud of 
dust.

INT.  WAITING AREA

Tiger sees the front door ajar. And as she approaches to explore 
what lies beyond--

The door swings open...

ZOWIE, A SIBERIAN HUSKY is staring back at her. He's black and 
white with blue eyes, with a mask that is at once menacing and 
majestic.

A pudgy thirteen year old boy, DREW, has a hold of the dog's 
collar.

Zowie's BARK sends Tiger scrambling.

Drew loses his grip as Zowie yanks free. A strong, paternal 
command calls after Drew from outside.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Drew, you get a handle on that
		dog, now!

INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM

Chase spins around at the commotion as Tiger darts across the 
floor with the barking dog in pursuit.

Mayhem ensues as Zowie's big paws slip on the slick tile.

Geoff rushes in from the boarding area.

Tiger ducks beneath the back of a surgical gurney.

Zowie's snoot wedges beneath the base, inches from Tiger's tiny, 
striking paw.

Drew slides in on his knees, renewing his hold on Zowie's collar. 
He pulls the dog back.

Geoff rescues Tiger from beneath the gurney.

Drew shrugs sheepishly.

				DREW
		Sorry. He gets kinda hyper...

Drew's stepfather, Gus Gilbert, enters. The dreaded, domineering 
voice of authority in Drew's life. WE know him as the sheriff at 
Renee's funeral.

				GUS
		Hell, he thought it was lunch.
		How ya doin', Chase?
			(a handshake)
		You haven't met my boy.
			(aside)
		Drew, where the hell are your
		manners.

Drew steps forward and awkwardly offers his hand to Chase. Then 
Geoff. The boys shake.

				GEOFF
		He's a cool lookin' dog.

Zowie lurches forward, eager to shower affection on Geoff. Geoff 
strokes the dog's soft mane.

				GEOFF
		What's his name?

				DREW
		Zowie.

Drew puts his palm under Zowie's chin and turns him for Chase to 
see. There are several scabbed-over gashes on his left cheek.

				GUS
		Damn dog stuck his nose in on my
		rabbits and they ganged up on him.
		I swear that dog's an idiot.

				DREW
		Is he gonna be okay?

With one eye on Zowie, Chase sprays some antiseptic on the 
examination table and wipes it clean.

				CHASE
		Let's have him hop up here.

Drew prods Zowie. Zowie jumps up onto the table. Chase looks over 
the facial lacerations, then turns on a penlight and examines the 
dog's eyes.

Gus passes a lingering look over Tiger. He reaches in to pet her, 
making sure it meets with Geoff's approval.

				GUS
		When I was young I thought cats
		were the girls and dogs were the
		boys.

				CHASE
		There are three more girls where
		that one came from looking for
		homes.

Drew perks up at the thought, but Gus shoots it down.

				GUS
		Not our home.

Chase takes the light out of Zowie's eyes. He looks to Gus.

				CHASE
		Thee facial lacerations should heal
		up pretty quickly. I'll give you
		som antibiotic cream--

				GUS
		--Drew, he's your dog. Are you
		listening to this?

Chase turns to Drew and continues...

				CHASE
		His left eye is scratched, corneal
		abrasion. Eyedrops will help, but
		it's going to take som time. Try
		to keep him away from those
		rabbits, huh?

Drew nods, casting a glance aside at Gus.

				GUS
			(to Chase)
		I hear you've got Marjorie
		Hargrove working for you now.

				CHASE
		How'd you know that?

Gus gives Chase a knowing grin.

				GUS
		It's a small town, Chase.

Gus laughs and claps Chase on the shoulder.

				GUS
		Hey Geoff, did you know your
		mother and I used to be high-
		school sweethearts?

Geoff is surprised at this. Surprised and annoyed. Tact isn't a 
quality that Gus possesses in abundance.

				GEOFF
		Really?

				GUS
			(nodding)
		Homecoming. Prom. Whole nine
		yards.
			(to Chase)
		Course that was a lifetime ago.

EXT.  SCHOOL - DAY

JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL KIDS are converging en masse for classes. 
Chase's van pulls up front.

INT.  VAN - DAY

Chase digs some cash out of his wallet. Geoff stares out at the 
school. He's dreading this.

				CHASE
		What's a lunch cost these days?
		You want ten?

				GEOFF
			(unenthused)
		Sure.

Chase looks at his son.

				CHASE
		You nervous? New town, new
		school. I know it must be pretty
		hard for you...

				GEOFF
			(cutting him off)
		I'll be fine, Dad.

Geoff reaches for the door, but Chase stops him. He's trying to 
reach his son. He really is.

				CHASE
			(awkward)
		Geoff... you have to help me out
		here a little...

"MEOW!" Chase drops his eyes to the bulge squirming around in 
Geoff's jacket. He can't help but smile.

				CHASE
		Are you sure you don't want me to
		pick you up. It's a long ride.

Geoff opens the side panel of the van and slips out his MOUNTAIN 
BIKE.

				GEOFF
		That's what my bike's for...

Before Chase can say another word, Geoff is gone.

EXT.  VAN - DAY

As Chase pulls away, WE SEE the handmade sign taped in the back 
window:

				PRICELESS KITTENS
				FREE TO A GOOD HOME

EXT.  SCHOOL - DAY

Drew is among a small circle of BOYS. He recognizes Geoff walking 
his bike from the van. The largest of the boys, CLYDE, takes 
notice of the unfamiliar face.

Clyde is fifteen, going on twenty. You know the type: local bully, 
held back a year or two.

				CLYDE
		Check it out. That's the new kid.
		The son of that movie star.

Mischief gleams in Clyde's eyes as he watches Geoff's every move. 
The other boys follow suit. Clyde always takes the lead.

Geoff fields their penetrating stares. For a second his eyes 
connect with Clyde's, then he moves on into the building.

Among the boys, Drew is the reluctant participant.

INT.  CLASSROOM - DAY

MRS. GORDON is addressing a room of SEVENTH GRADERS.

Geoff is doodling in his notebook, feeling acutely out of place as 
he tries to avoid the curious glances the rest of his new 
classmates are giving him.

				MRS. GORDON
		People, this is Geoff Matthews.
		He'll be joining our class for the
		rest of the school year...

As Mrs. Gordon points to him, Geoff drops his face even lower. 
This is the worst embarrassment a boy could ever suffer. He'd like 
to throttle Mrs. Gordon.

A freckle-faced boy, DOUG, fires off a question.

				DOUG
		Hey, what's Hollywood like? Do
		you know Eddie Murphy?

				GEOFF
			(annoyed)
		No.

				MRS. GORDON
		Why don't we save that for later,
		Doug?

A girl with braces, SUSAN, continues the interrogation.

				SUSAN
		What about Julia Roberts?

				MRS. GORDON
		Susan! That'll be enough.

Susan shuts up. Geoff sinks even lower in his seat.

The kids turn their eyes back to the front of the room.

But one classmate's eyes are still on Geoff. It's Clyde.

Clyde shifts his stare to the squirming lump in Geoff's jacket. He
catches a glimpse of Tiger's bobbing nose popping out.

INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

Geoff joins the stampede of kids as the BELL releases them for the 
day. Almost immediately, Clyde and his cronies, STEVIE AND BRAD, 
fall in step behind him. Drew hangs slightly off to the side, not 
really wanting to be a part of the intimidation.

				CLYDE
		What's the hurry, Junior? Where
		you off to?

Clyde quickens his pace, pulling ahead of Geoff and stopping in 
front of him. Stevie and Brad move in on either side. Surrounded 
by peers, it's apparent how small Geoff is for his age.

On the wall next to them is a bulletin board display. Clyde 
glances at it. Geoff follows his gaze.

DISPLAY

It's one of those corny school affairs with construction paper 
letters spelling out: "WE REMEMBER RENEE HALLOW." Beneath that are 
pictures of Renee clipped from various magazines. Cloyingly 
tasteless.

				CLYDE
			(feigning remorse)
		Too bad about your Mom. Papers
		said it was pretty gross, getting
		fried like that. Guess you saw
		it, huh?

Geoff nods. Clyde raises his eyebrows, pulling Geoff's jacket 
open.

				CLYDE
		So, what are you hiding there?

				STEVIE
		When you bring a friend to school
		you're supposed to introduce him.

Geoff's arm tightens protectively around Tiger.

				GEOFF
		Her name's Tiger.

				CLYDE
		Tiger? Don't you think that's
		kind of a pussy name?
			(reaching out)
		Can I hold her? I promise I'll be
		real careful.

Clyde has a convincing way about him. Geoff reluctantly hands the 
kitten over. Clyde is so gentle with the creature that one would 
never question his sincerity.

Geoff is just beginning to feel at ease when something changes in 
Clyde's tone, something sinister.

				CLYDE
		Hey, Geoff. You ever seen a
		kitten run?

				GEOFF
		I've seen her run around the
		house.

Clyde's eyes narrow. He takes a couple of steps back. Geoff's 
heart starts to sink.

				CLYDE
		No, I mean really run...
			(beat)
		Like this!

Clyde backsteps and bolts off down the hallway with Tiger. Brad 
and Stevie fall in behind him, laughing.

Drew shrugs apologetically. He's torn, but he tears off after them 
nonetheless.

				GEOFF
		Shit...

Geoff runs off in pursuit of them.

EXT.  SCHOOL - DAY

Geoff rushes from the building, searching the dispersing crowd. 
There they are, tearing from the bike racks, pedaling for the 
street.

Clyde sees Geoff and mockingly holds the kitten out for display as 
they ride by.

Geoff runs for the bike racks.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Clyde and his cohorts break from the outskirts of town, riding out 
onto the open road.

Clyde glances back toward the center of town.

Geoff is so far behind he's barely visible.

Clyde returns his eyes to the road ahead, raising Tiger nose to 
nose with him.

				CLYDE
		Having fun yet?

Clyde and his smirking buddies ride on, OUT OF FRAME.

WITH GEOFF

giving the pedals all he can, struggling to keep pace with the 
boys.

35    OMITTED

FURTHER ALONG

Scattered houses sprinkle the landscape ahead. Cochran Lake 
stretches into the distance beyond the housing.

Clyde's clan cuts from the road and blazes a trail across a 
residential property. The two-story house is weathered and boarded 
up. It looks vaguely familiar. Creepy.

And when WE FIND the mailbox post, we know why. The name is faded, 
but there's no question who once lived there. Five bold letters: 
"CREED."

Geoff whips by in a blur, still in pursuit.

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Clyde and his friends have abandoned their bikes. They've taken 
position on top of the slope of the hill, standing at the foot of 
THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY.

38    OMITTED

EXT.  PET SEMATARY PATH - DAY

Geoff pulls his bike to a stop short of the boys. He dismounts and 
leans it up against a tree.

				GEOFF
		Just give me the cat, all right?

A devilish grin creeps over Clyde. He strolls down the path toward 
Geoff. Clyde grabs Geoff's handlebars and, backing up, pulls Geoff 
and the bike with him.

				CLYDE
		I would but... there was a little
		accident...
			(feeding off Geoff's
			alarm)
		She was trying to get away. You
		know, running down my leg... and
		her head got too close to the 
		spokes. Pretty gross. What's
		left of her is up in the Pet
		Sematary. A zip-lock bag might
		help...
			(shrugs)
		...but I happen to be out of them
		at the moment.

Drew shakes his head, disgusted he has to put up with Clyde's 
antics.

				DREW
		Come on, Clyde, just tell him
		where the cat is...

				CLYDE
			(turning on Drew)
		...I TOLD HIM where the cat is!
		Now shut up, fuck-face!

Clyde punches Drew in the arm. Drew shrinks back.

Geoff flashes a hateful stare at Clyde.

All of the boys but Clyde are uncomfortably silent. There's 
something frightening about Clyde... something that extends beyond 
the standard bully antics. We begin to get the feeling that this 
kid is genuinely deranged.

				CLYDE
			(relishing the
			moment)
		You heard about the Creed murders
		yet? And the place where the dead
		come back to life?

He motions to the path behind him.

				CLYDE
			(continuing)
		It's just back there. Just down
		that path...

				DREW
			(meekly)
		Clyde... it's not funny anymore.

				CLYDE
		Oh? So you got a problem?
		What're you gonna do, fat-ass? You
		gonna sic big, bad, old Gus after
		me?

Drew shuts up. Clyde turns back to Geoff, drawing closer.

				CLYDE
		What do you think, Geoff? Maybe
		you could dig up your Mom and take
		her back there. Maybe if you pray
		real hard, she'll come back.

With this last remark Clyde has pushed too far. Geoff's face is 
red with anger.

				GEOFF
			(quietly)
		Just give me the cat, ass-hole.

Clyde's grin falters a moment.

				CLYDE
		Excuse me, maybe I'm a little hard
		of hearing... but did you just call
		me an ass-hole?

Clyde pokes Geoff in the shoulder.

				CLYDE
		You mad, Geoff? Cause if you are,
		you should take a shot at me...

This time Clyde shoves Geoff back even harder.

				CLYDE
		Come on, you pussy! What's the
		matter with you?

Clyde moves forward again and Geoff suddenly LASHES OUT, catching 
everyone off guard.

For an instant, Drew marvels at Geoff's tenacity.

Clyde LUNGES. He hammers Geoff with blows.

Outsizing him by forty pounds, Clyde tosses Geoff to the ground. 
Geoff struggles, but Clyde's grip proves arresting.

Clyde throws Geoff onto his stomach, forcing his face into the 
dirt. It looks as if he's ready to smother his opponent.

Drew is the first to rush in. Brad and Stevie quickly follow. It 
takes all three of them to peel Clyde off Geoff.

Clyde gets to his feet and backs away. There's great pleasure in 
his crazed eyes as he watches Geoff coughing and gasping.

				CLYDE
		Fuckin' ass-hole.

Satisfied he's handed out enough ill will for the day, Clyde turns 
away.

Drew's attentions remain on Geoff. As Clyde strolls by, he grabs 
Drew's arm and swings him around.

				CLYDE
		This way, fat-boy.

Stevie and Brad follow. As the group passes Geoff's bike, Clyde 
gives it a kick, knocking it over. Then they're gone.

Geoff pulls himself to his feet. Brushing off the mess, he heads 
up the path in search of Tiger.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - DAY

The woods here have grown long with shadows. The air is still and 
the sound of birds is conspicuously absent.

A WOODEN ARCHWAY frames the entrance to the primitive graveyard. 
Scrawled across the weatherstained boards is a child's barely 
legible attempt at "PET SEMATARY."

Geoff trepidatiously enters the clearing of crude, crowded graves. 
Collars, leashes, bird cages and other accessories adorn the 
makeshift crosses and headstones.

Geoff moves along the outer circle of markers, each crafted by a 
child's caring hands.

As he searches, he can't help but notice the heartfelt epitaphs. 
On the outer circle, he sees a crate-board marker memorializing: 
SMUCKY THE CAT... HE WAS OBEDIANT.

MOVING INWARD, the markers are older. The ones he can still read 
convey a sense of the perpetual cycle of life and death.

Here is a wide, flat, upright board planted deep in the earth: "In 
Memory of MARTA our Pet Rabit Dyed March 1 1965."

The next three rows are illegible, the inscriptions are weathered 
beyond recognition... And then, chiseled into sandstone: HANNAH 
THE BEST DOG THAT EVER LIVED 1929-1939.

And now... "MEOW." Faint. But very much alive.

Geoff picks up his pace, weaving quickly toward the center.

There, he finds Tiger. Trapped in a rusted old birdcage, its base 
swallowed by the grave.

Geoff opens the door and frees Tiger, stroking the trembling 
kitten.

Geoff's eyes are drawn to the far perimeter... to the deadfall...

THE DEADFALL looms on the outskirts of the clearing like a pile of 
skeletal remains. An abstract stairway to things beyond. A wind 
picks up just then, sending leaves skittering in waves across the 
ground.

40    OMITTED

EXT.  PET SEMATARY PATH - DAY

When Geoff turns around, he finds Drew waiting for him under the 
archway. Drew smiles, full of respect for Geoff.

				DREW
		I've never seen anybody punch
		Clyde before.

				GEOFF
			(shrugs)
		He pissed me off.

				DREW
			(his smile fading)
		Sorry about your mom.
			(beat)
		I couldn't handle not having my
		mom around. Just having Gus...

He grimaces at the thought.

				GEOFF
		My dad's not so bad.

Drew glances around at all the makeshift grave markers.

				DREW
		I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was
		dead...

				GEOFF
			(serious)
		You shouldn't ever say that about
		your parents, not even your Dad.

				DREW
		Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.

Geoff nods knowingly.

				GEOFF
		What was all that stuff about dead
		people coming back to life?

				DREW
		Nothing. It's just an old ghost
		story. Let's get out of here...

They head off, full of childhood.

INT.  KITCHEN - DUSK

Marjorie is at the stove, fixing up dinner, while Chase scans the 
newspaper at the table.

Geoff enters through the kitchen door. He moves past them without 
a word.

				CHASE
			(calling after him)
		Hey! How was your first day at
		school?

				GEOFF
			(over his shoulder)
		It sucked.

				MARJORIE
		Now is that any way to talk to
		your father?

Geoff stops for a moment, turns...

				GEOFF
		You're not my mother.

...and exits through the opposite door.

Chase looks to Marjorie and offers a sympathetic shrug.

				CHASE
		Sorry.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - DUSK

CRUDE CAGES HOUSE DOZENS OF RABBITS. Situated alongside the 
garage. A sign above the cages reads: PET RABBITS - $10.00. Bells 
positioned along the roof threaten to reveal foul play.

Gus is rigging a wire along the base of the cage.

Finishing it off, he hangs the plug next to an outside socket. 
Moving onto the next chore, he pours pressed alfalfa pellets into 
feeding slots for the hungry rabbits.

Setting the feed aside, he takes a seat. Opening one of the cages, 
he grabs a rabbit and sets it on his lap, gently petting its soft 
fur.

One of the cages starts to vibrate.

Gus gives it a look: A PAIR OF RABBITS aren't interested in 
eating, they're joined in fast and furious passion.

Gus gets a chuckle out of the sight.

				GUS
		Way to go, Romeo...

Gus replaces the rabbit in the hutch. And before he goes, HE SINKS 
THE PLUG INTO THE SOCKET. An ELECTRICAL CHARGE dances along the 
base of the cage, a deterrent for intruders.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Drew's mother, AMANDA, withdraws a roast from the oven.

Gus is at the sink, washing his hands. He turns to see Zowie 
laying at Drew's feet in the living room. Drew is watching a MUSIC 
VIDEO on TV.

				GUS
		Drew, I don't remember inviting
		Zowie in for dinner.

				DREW
		Just until he heals up?

Gus is waggling his thumb toward the back door.

Drew slumps in defeat.

Gus reaches into the cabinet and pours himself a Bourbon.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Drew walks Zowie from the house with a dish of dog food. As they 
pass the rabbit dens, Zowie alters his path. Drew gets a handful 
of his collar and pulls him back.

Across the yard is an enclosed dog run. Twenty feet long by ten 
feet wide. Drew puts Zowie inside with the dog food.

Drew strokes Zowie's mane affectionately, then backs away, closing 
the wood-framed door to the dog run.

INT.  DREW'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Amanda's about to put the roast on the table when Gus nuzzles up 
behind her, breathing down her backside. With his drink in hand, 
he sweeps her hair aside and zeros in for a kiss on the back of 
the neck.

Gus eases his free hand around between Amanda and the counter and 
presses his palm firmly into her crotch, drawing her body tight to 
him.

She stiffens at his intimate hold, uncomfortable with his timing.

				AMANDA
		Gus, please...

At the back door, Drew is watching from beyond the screen, 
disgusted by the sight of Gus pawing his mother. Drew swings the 
door open as loud as he can to signal his return.

Gus plants a last kiss on the back of Amanda's neck and backs off. 
But before he goes, he snatches a chunk of meat from the serving 
platter. Leveling his leering eyes at Amanda, he stuffs it into 
his mouth suggestively.

				GUS
		God damn, you're good.

Drew rolls his eyes and takes his seat at the table, returning his 
attention to the TV, where another MUSIC VIDEO is on.

Gus glances at the TV, annoyed by the MUSIC. He drops into his 
spot at the head of the table, blocking Drew's view. Drew leans to 
the side for a better look. Gus takes notice and leans to the same 
side to obstruct his view.

				GUS
		You're breaking the law here,
		Drew.

				AMANDA
		Really, Gus. It won't bother me.

Gus ignores her, inching forward with a confidential, harsh 
whisper.

				GUS
		Your mom's spent the last hour
		cooking. Stop being a little jerk
		and show her some appreciation.

Drew aims the remote control at Gus, as if to shut him up, and 
silences the TV.

Amanda approaches with the roast. The moment it's on the table, 
Drew starts dishing up a hefty serving. Gus spears Drew's fork 
with the serving fork.

				GUS
		Not that much appreciation. I
		thought we were gonna tone down
		that flabby ass.

				DREW
		Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud
		that you are.

				AMANDA
		Knock it off, guys...

Gus throws back a sip of Bourbon.

				GUS
			(to Drew, quietly)
		You watch that mouth of yours,
		Drew buddy.

46    OMITTED

EXT.  ZOWIE'S DOG RUN - NIGHT

MOVING THROUGH Zowie's enclosed pen, WE SEE no sign of the dog. 
REACHING the door, WE FIND that the wood around the bottom hinge 
has been chewed through. The base of the door is ajar, just enough 
for a dog to have slipped through.

EXT.  RABBIT CAGES - NIGHT

In the still of the night, Gus' rabbit pens sit unattended. And 
then WE HEAR the tinkling of dog tags. Snoozing rabbits awaken as 
Zowie lumbers INTO FRAME.

Zowie rises on his hind legs, pressing his paws to a cage. Blue 
sparks fly as Zowie is jolted with the electrical charge.

INT.  GUS' ROOM - NIGHT

The ELECTRICAL ZING. The dog's whimpering CRY. And the RINGING OF 
BELLS reach Gus in rapid succession, rousting him from his sleep. 
He rolls out of bed and grabs his robe.

				GUS
		Damn it, Drew. That dog is
		history!

Amanda stirs, groggily focusing on Gus' departing figure.

INT.  DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT

Drew swings open the door to the hallway as Gus marches by, 
stuffing shells into a shotgun. Panicked, Drew takes off after 
him.

EXT.  RABBIT CAGES - NIGHT

Zowie swings his head in the direction of the house as Gus bursts 
through the back door. Drew is one step behind.

Gus swings the gun up and fires off a SHOT.

Zowie bolts for the shadows of the hillside.

Drew rushes in and deflects the aim of the rifle.

				DREW
		Don't shoot him!

Gus' eyes are wild with anger.

				GUS
		What, Drew? What did you say?!

Gus throws Drew aside, brings the rifle back up and FIRES another 
random shot after the fleeing dog. All the while, his eyes remain 
on Drew, as if this were the boy's lesson to be learned.

He squeezes off one more SHOT...

A PAINED YELP echoes from the hillside. Zowie's yelp.

Drew whips his head aside in sickened shock. Even Gus is sobered 
by the unexpected hit.

All they can hear now are Zowie's WHIMPERING CRIES diminishing in 
the night.

Drew shoots Gus a look of such unbridled hatred that Gus is 
speechless. He backs away from Gus and darts off toward the dark 
hillside.

When Gus turns back for the house, Amanda is standing there.

				AMANDA
		Jesus, Gus, what have you done?

				GUS
		Ah, come on, Amanda, stop looking
		at me like that. He's had ample
		warning about that dog.

Amanda glares at him, an outpouring of pent-up strain.

Gus defiantly marches past Amanda, entering the house without ever 
meeting eyes with her.

EXT.  WOODS - NIGHT

Drew pauses long enough to listen for Zowie...

Nothing until a FAINT CRY drifts back at him.

DEEPER IN THE WOODS

Zowie limps INTO FRAME. Blood is flowing from the bullet wound in 
his left hindquarter, trailing from his suspended leg. Every step 
is a strain.

DREW

comes upon a break in the trees. The hanging moon outlines the 
knoll stretching beyond. And then, the strained breathing, the 
hushed WHIMPER.

Drew hesitantly approaches the crest of the knoll.

Zowie is just beyond, lying on his side at the end of the bloody 
trail. His chest rises and falls almost imperceptibly with every 
effort to survive.

Drew drops to his knees at Zowie's side and cradles the dog in his 
lap, shaking his head in denial.

Zowie's weak eyes shift, gazing longingly at Drew.

Drew strokes the fur under Zowie's chin, hardly able to see the 
dog through his glaze of tears.

Zowie's eyes drift off. His chest falls and doesn't rise again. He 
falls limp in Drew's arms. Drew hugs Zowie even tighter and he 
begins to weep.

FROM A DISTANCE

WE SEE the image of Drew with the dog cradled in his arms, 
silhouetted against the moonlit horizon.

								DISSOLVE TO:

53    OMITTED

EXT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - MORNING

Geoff appears from the garage with his bike and takes off for the 
road. A WHISTLE catches his ear.

Drew is at the edge of the woods, beckoning for Geoff.

Geoff circles around and doubles back.

				GEOFF
		I was just going by your house.
		Where's your bike?

The closer Geoff gets, the more he sees of Drew's despair. Then he 
sees the dried blood staining Drew's clothes.

				DREW
		Zowie's dead.

Geoff's heart sinks. An unspoken moment of sympathy passes between 
the boys. Fighting the emotions, Drew finally speaks.

				DREW
		I have to bury him. I don't want
		to go out there alone.

There's such grief in Drew's words that Geoff can't resist. He 
glances toward his house to make sure he hasn't been seen, then 
blends into the woods.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - DAY

Drew carries Zowie's relaxed form in his arms. Geoff is following, 
balancing a pickaxe and shovel.

Arriving at the graveyard, Geoff searches the outer perimeter for 
a vacant stretch of soil. Finding one, he lets the heavy tools 
fall to the ground.

				GEOFF
		Is this a good spot?

				DREW
		I'm not burying him here...

				GEOFF
		Why not?

				DREW
		There's a better place...

Drew heads for the base of the deadfall, with Zowie in his arms.

				DREW
		It's back here somewhere, through
		the Indian woods. I know we can
		find it...

Drew continues up the deadfall, disappearing over the crest.

Geoff gathers up the shovel and pickaxe and follows after him.

				GEOFF
		Hey, wait up!

EXT.  THE BOG - DAY

Geoff climbs over the peak of the deadfall...

Beyond is a dark swamp, A BOG, looking unlike anything one would 
expect in Maine. Tendrils of ground fog swirl about vegetation 
that looks almost prehistoric. Gnarled trees rise up from the 
murky earth, blocking the sun from view.

Geoff hurries down the other side of the deadfall to catch up with 
Drew. Somewhere off in the distance we hear an UNEARTHLY SOUND. 
Not a bird. Not any animal known to man.

Spectral shapes flicker at the edge of Geoff's vision, sinking 
back into the shadows as Geoff tries to focus on them.

				GEOFF
			(uneasy)
		Drew, where are we going?

Drew doesn't respond. He continues on without another word, hell-
bent on finding this "better place."

FURTHER ALONG - DAY

At the boundary of the bog, A STAIRWAY OF HUGE, WIDE STONES rises 
from the blanket of ground fog. Bordered by fir trees. Leading up 
the hillside. The final leg of Drew and Geoff's journey.

				DREW
		This is it... I wasn't sure if it
		even really existed.

				GEOFF
		What did?

				DREW
		The old Indian burial ground.

Geoff's eyes move to the stairway of stones.

				GEOFF
		Come on, that's just a bullshit
		story. You said so yourself...

				DREW
		What if it's not bullshit? If I
		bury Zowie there, and it works...
			(beat)
		...he'll come back alive.

				GEOFF
		Drew, I know your dog died, but...
		get a grip, man, you're freaking
		me out.

				DREW
		Look, if there was even one chance
		in a million it'd work, wouldn't
		you want to try?

Geoff feels for Drew. It's pointless to reason.

Drew starts up the stone steps. Geoff has no choice but to follow.

EXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - DAY

Even in broad daylight, the flat-topped mesa has a sense of 
foreboding isolation. There's an almost palpable sense of 
"wrongness" about this place. As if the darkness of a dying black 
hole was seeping out of the ground and spreading across the earth.

Drew and Geoff approach the circle of rocky soil. They stand at 
the border, looking it over in eerie silence.

Somewhere off in the distance we hear the unearthly SOUND again, 
only this time, it's closer.

				GEOFF
		Look, let's just get this over
		with.

Even Drew seems to have awakened from the haze he had fallen into. 
He gently sets Zowie's body on the ground.

				DREW
		If this doesn't work... don't ever
		tell anyone I did this, okay? You
		gotta promise...

Geoff nods and hands over the digging tools. Drew swings the 
pickaxe, sinking it into the ground.

				GEOFF
		You want me to help?

				DREW
		You have to bury your own. That's
		the way the Indians did it. It's
		like a rule...

Backing away from the burial ground, Geoff takes a seat on a rock 
at the border of the forest. From there, he watches.

Drew alternates the pickaxe and shovel as he clears a hole in the 
rocky ground.

WE MOVE IN ON GEOFF, who's looking on with skeptical intrigue as 
the rhythmic SOUND of the tools continues.

59    OMITTED

LATER -

A cairn is complete: a conical pile of rocks over Zowie's grave.

Drew is now sitting on the rock next to Geoff. Together, they 
stare at the cairn as if Zowie might climb from beneath at any 
moment.

				DREW
		What if he really does come back?

Geoff shrugs, pondering such a thought.

Geoff digs into his pocket and produces a pack of gum, offering 
one to Drew. With only a quick glance away from the grave, Drew 
snatches a piece and he stuffs it into his mouth. Geoff does the 
same.

They sit together in silence. Nervously chewing their gum. 
Watching the grave.

				DREW
		I've never had anyone die
		before...
			(beat)
		...but I guess you get over it. I
		mean, eventually...

				GEOFF
			(quietly)
		You never get over it.

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - AFTERNOON

The sun dips over the horizon, giving way to dusk.

EXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - DUSK

Geoff's eyes shift from the grave to the darkening sky.

				GEOFF
		It's getting pretty late. We
		better go.

				DREW
			(disappointed)
		Yeah...

They rise, leaving the burial ground. En route, Drew pauses for a 
last look at the grave.

				DREW
		So long, Zowie...

Geoff follows, glancing back at the burial ground. It looks 
magical in the twilight, not quite so sinister now.

EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT

Drew is walking home along the road, alone.

Headlights blind him as a car approaches. It slows and pulls a U-
turn, stopping at Drew's side. It's Gus' squad car. He pushes open 
the passenger door.

				GUS
		Get in.

Drew takes a step back, shaking his head.

				GUS
		Your momma's worried sick over
		you. You take off in the middle
		of the night, you don't show up
		for school. What're you trying to
		prove?

				DREW
		I'm not trying to prove anything.
			(beat)
		I was burying my dog.

Gus turns his eyes away, focusing on the dark road ahead.

				GUS
		Life is full of lessons. No one's
		above it. Not you. Not me...
		Now get in the car.

After a moment, Drew approaches the car. Without another word, Gus 
drives off.

EXT.  RABBIT CAGE - NIGHT

It's quiet now. And out of the silence comes the JINGLING of 
Zowie's dog tags. Zowie's LONG SHADOW creeps over the cage, 
distorted to monstrous proportion by the flickering light.

We move past the cages to the back porch...

We see ZOWIE'S PAW scratching at the door.

INT.  AMANDA AND GUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Amanda wakens with a start. She rises, eyes focusing on the dark 
bedroom. Gus is sound asleep next to her. Then, from outside, we 
faintly hear ZOWIE'S SCRATCHING.

Slowly, Amanda rises from bed, pulling on a bathrobe as she heads 
for the door.

EXT.  BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Amanda appears at the door. She unlatches it, stepping outside.

				AMANDA
		Zowie?

Amanda looks down and SCREAMS.

INT.  DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT

Photos of Drew with Zowie are tacked on the wall above the bed. 
The one photo of Drew, Amanda and Gus has been altered with a cut-
out head of Zowie's pasted on Gus' shoulders.

WE FIND Drew below. He's fallen asleep with his Walkman on. Even 
with his ears covered, the POUNDING at the door jolts him awake. 
Half asleep, Drew peels off the headphones.

				GUS (O.S.)
		Drew, you unlock this door! Right
		now!

				AMANDA (O.S.)
		Unlock it, Drew!

The anger in his mother's voice brings him off the bed. Gus' 
POUNDING continues.

Drew moves to the door. The inside is secured by a double dead 
bolt. Instead of unlocking them, he opens a tiny, customized 
window which gives him a view of the hall.

				DREW
		What did I do now?

				AMANDA
		Open the door, Drew.

Drew unlatches the deadbolts and steps back as Gus bursts through 
the door.

				GUS
		Where do you come off lying like
		that? "I'm burying my dog." You
		think a lie like that's never
		gonna catch up to you?

Drew backs into the bed, taking a seat.

Amanda comes through the door, and behind her is...

ZOWIE

This is our first glimpse of the resurrected dog. Fur shiny and 
wet, the gaping gunshot wound in his rear. Zowie's head hangs low, 
his eyes GLEAMING RED. The husky is covered with dirt from head to 
toe.

Drew's eyes widen in astonishment.

Zowie staggers across the room towards Drew, nails clicking on the 
floorboards. Drew shrinks back in uncertain horror as the dog 
moves closer.

Zowie absently throws his arms up onto the bed, across Drew's lap. 
And slowly, perfunctory, his tongue licks Drew's cheek. This last 
action of Zowie displaces Drew's fear. Tears well up in the boy's 
eyes.

				DREW
			(a whisper)
		Zowie...

				GUS
		Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going
		outside. You're grounded, buddy.
		That's the new law.

Drew lifts his hand from stroking Zowie's fur. His palm is covered 
with muddy blood.

				AMANDA
		I never knew an open wound could
		smell so bad...
			(beat)
		Honey, he should have been looked
		at this morning. I don't know
		what you were thinking. It's a
		wonder he's still alive.

Drew gazes into the dog's vacant eyes. It truly is a wonder.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Chase enters and stops in the doorway.

Geoff sits in front of the television with a pile of videotapes 
next to him. He's scanning through Renee's old movies with the 
remote. The sound has been turned down and the effect is a little 
eerie.

ON THE SCREEN

We see RENEE move through a scene. Geoff hits the slo-mo button 
and the image winds down. Renee's face. HER EYES stare out at us 
from the alien universe of the past.

				CHASE
			(gently)
		Geoff...

Geoff doesn't respond. He's captivated by Renee.

Chase moves into the room.

				CHASE
		Geoff!

Geoff PAUSES the tape. Renee freezes, the image flickering ever so 
slightly. For an instant, we think we see a FLASH OF Renee being 
electrocuted. But it's only an instant.

Finally, Geoff tears his eyes away from the screen, resenting his 
father's intrusion.

				GEOFF
		What?

				CHASE
		You alright?

Geoff's face softens. He nods.

				GEOFF
		Dad... do you think...
			(beat)
		...you think you and Mom would've
		gotten back together?

Chase draws closer. He takes a seat next to Geoff. The pain in his 
son's eyes is almost more than he can stand.

				CHASE
		I think so.

				CHASE
			(continuing)
		Your Mom and I loved each other,
		Geoff. Don't ever think that we
		didn't.

				GEOFF
		I still can't believe she's
		dead...

Chase moves to reach for his son, and suddenly the phone RINGS, 
shattering the moment.

Chase hesitates, but finally he rises and answers the phone.

After a moment, he returns.
				GEOFF
		Who was that?

				CHASE
		Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He
		got hurt again. I'm going over to
		take a look at him.

Geoff's eyes widen. He looks like a ghost walked over his grave.

				GEOFF
		I'm going with you.

Chase nods and exits to get his coat.

Geoff looks back at the TV once more. The image paused.

Renee staring at us from beyond the grave.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gus, Amanda, Drew and Geoff are gathered around Chase's van.

EXT./INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT

Chase lays Zowie on his side on an examining table and shines an 
overhead light onto the wound.

Geoff is looking in from outside, utterly bewildered by the 
living, breathing dog.

				CHASE
		How'd it happen?

Gus casts a threatening glance in Drew's direction.

				DREW
			(glaring at Gus)
		Some psycho hunter probably got
		trigger happy...

Chase is too busy preparing a syringe to notice the nonverbal 
exchange.

				CHASE
		I'm going to give Zowie a local
		anaesthetic so I can clean up the
		wound. I'd like to take him home
		tonight for observation.

				AMANDA
		Fine.

				DREW
		Can you keep him at your place
		until he gets better?

				CHASE
		Sure...

Drew tenderly strokes Zowie's mane as Chase administers the 
injection. Zowie stares up at Geoff with dull, blank eyes.

Drew reads Geoff's bewilderment and joins him outside the van. 
Their words are clear, but whispered.

				GEOFF
		Maybe he wasn't dead when we
		buried him.

				DREW
		He was dead. You know he was.

Geoff returns his stare to Zowie.

				DREW
		You can't tell anyone, Geoff.
		Ever.

Geoff looks into Drew's eyes and nods in understanding.

INT.  GEOFF'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tiger is curled up at the foot of Geoff's bed. Geoff climbs in, 
careful not to disturb the kitten. As he lays his head back on the 
pillow...

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Sleep tight, darling. I'll be
		with you soon.

It's a woman's VOICE. A familiar one. Now we hear the rhythmic 
CREAK of a rocking chair. And with it comes the voice again, 
humming a HAUNTING LULLABY.

Wide-eyed, Geoff turns his head toward the source...

A WOMAN'S NONDESCRIPT FORM is seated in the rocking chair across 
the room. Rocking forward, her face passes into a swath of 
moonlight...

It's Renee. With the rock of the chair, her face recedes back into 
the shadows. Her soothing HUM remains.

And again, her face passes into the swath of light. And again it 
retreats.

Geoff raises his hand, reaching out for her.

Renee's hand rises from the shadows, reaching for him.

But suddenly, THE ROOM BEGINS TO STRETCH.

The rocking chair and the bed seem distanced like polar extremes, 
mother and son hopelessly separated by forces beyond their 
control.

LIGHTNING FLASHES in the bedside window. Renee is falling farther 
and farther away.

				GEOFF
		Mom!!!

Geoff leaps from his bed as the darkness closes in and...

GEOFF

bolts up from his pillow. Awake now, face wet with perspiration. 
It was a nightmare. Except, if it was a nightmare, why do we still 
hear...

...the steady CREAK of the rocking chair.

Geoff slowly turns his head once again, repeating the actions of 
his dreams.

In the shadows, the chair is still rocking. As it comes forward 
into the moonlight, we see ZOWIE, curled up asleep on the seat of 
the chair.

Tiger is not on the bed anymore. She's up on top of the bookcase 
now, wide awake, eyes fixed on the dog. She HISSES.

Geoff stares at the rocking chair, petrified.

INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY

Chase strips off the bandage over Zowie's rear end. The wound is 
gooey and open.

Geoff reads the concern in Chase's expression. Drew is right there 
at Geoff's side, looking on.

				DREW
		What's the deal?

				CHASE
		I don't know. He's had three
		days. His immune system should've
		responded by now...

Chase puts on his stethoscope and checks under the dog's rib-cage 
for a pulse. He checks a number of places, then shakes his head, 
totally confused.

				CHASE
		I can't seem to find a pulse... it
		must be so weak, it's not
		registering...

Geoff and Drew share conspiratorial glances as Chase sets the 
stethoscope aside and extracts a blood sample.

Chase labels the capped vial of blood "ZOWIE" and carefully places 
it into a packing container. When he closes the lid, we see the 
preaddressed label:

			UNIVERSITY OF MAINE
		School of Veterinary Medicine
			Lab Samples Enclosed

Uncomfortable with Chase's investigation, Geoff reaches for Zowie.

				GEOFF
		We'll take him back to the
		kennels, Dad.

78A   OMITTED

INT.  BOARDING AREA - DUSK

THE KITTENS ARE HISSING, shrinking to the back of their kennel.

Zowie stands motionless before their cage, gazing in at them.

Geoff and Drew are nearby, putting the finishing touches on the 
bedding inside a larger boarding kennel.

				GEOFF
		You think my Dad'll figure out why
		he's not getting better?

				DREW
		You think he'd believe it if he
		did?

One of the kittens SPATS fearfully at Zowie. Geoff turns to stare 
at Zowie.

				GEOFF
		How can he not have a heartbeat?

				DREW
			(worried)
		Maybe it takes a while...

Drew lifts Zowie into the kennel. Geoff secures the door, 
something that clearly must be done from the outside.

Zowie immediately begins to pace back and forth inside the cage. 
He turns towards us and we...

								CUT TO:

EXT.  TOWN, CHASE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A SNARLING WEREWOLF rushing at us.

Chase jumps back, frightened out of his wits and we realize...

The werewolf is part of a group of COSTUMED KIDS out trick-or-
treating. The kids LAUGH at Chase's reaction and hurry on, 
dragging their candy loot bags behind them.

Chase sighs and turns to lock the office door. He's closing up for 
the night.

He climbs into his Mobile Vet Van. We HOLD ON the new sign in the 
back window: "A HALLOWEEN TREAT. FREE KITTENS." Beneath that is a 
pencil-sketch of a black arched-back kitten.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Marjorie and Geoff are at the kitchen table with the remnants of 
dinner. Geoff is doing last-minute touches on his costume.

Marjorie looks over his costume. He's got a hockey mask pushed 
back onto the top of his head.

				MARJORIE
		So who're you going as, Wayne
		Gretzky?

For effect, Geoff slips the hockey mask down over his face before 
answering.

				GEOFF
		I'm going as Jason.

				MARJORIE
		Jason? Who's he play for?

				GEOFF
		He doesn't. He hacks people up.

Geoff checks his watch.

				GEOFF
		I'm late.

As Geoff heads for the door, Chase is just coming in for the 
evening.

				CHASE
		Hey! Where're you off to?

				GEOFF
		I'm going out, Dad!

Geoff ducks out the door. Chase turns to Marjorie.

				CHASE
		Out?

				MARJORIE
		He's probably going up to the Pet
		Sematary. Kids've been going out
		there on Halloween night for
		years.

				CHASE
		What do they do up there?

				MARJORIE
		Oh, you know... drink beer, tell
		ghost stories. They try and spook
		each other out, talking about
		zombies and things...
			(she shrugs)
		It's no big deal, Chase. I did it
		when I was young.

INT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Drew is at the bathroom mirror.

				AMANDA
		Hold still. Hold still.

Amanda puts the finishing touches of color on Drew's lips. She's 
done an alarmingly good job of turning Drew into THE JOKER.

				AMANDA
		You make sure you're home by ten.
		If Gus finds out I let you go...

				DREW
			(sighs)
		I'll be home, Mom. Don't worry.
		I won't let Gus blow up again...

Amanda looks Drew straight in the eyes.

				AMANDA
		Drew, I know Gus isn't your
		father, but you never even knew
		your real father. He walked out
		on the both of us, and you
		remember that.
			(beat)
		Gus isn't that way. He has it in
		him to love us both. You just
		have to give him a chance...

Drew nods respectfully. Amanda gives him a kiss. Drawing back, she 
rubs out the lipmarks she's left on his made-up cheek.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

Dark clouds paint the foreboding sky. A broken pulse of lightning 
streaks through the dense haze.

Abandoning their bikes next to the path, Drew and Geoff approach 
the archway. The graveyard beyond is deathly silent.

They pass beneath the archway, entering the clearing.

And now, a soft, chilling VOICE drifts over the graves.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Geoff, honey. Mommy's here...

Geoff freezes in his tracks, awestruck as...

A WOMAN'S BODY

swoops down from the darkness above, materializing out of nowhere. 
A fluttering negligee. Flowing blonde hair.

RENEE'S FACE appears out of the shadows, masked with sadness.

Geoff swallows the lump in his throat.

Renee's form keeps coming. But even as she approaches, her visage 
grows less distinguishable. Just a phantom countenance now. A 
shadow framed by golden hair, resting atop a veiled body...

She's coming so fast that she's upon Geoff in no time. He fumbles 
back, startled out of his wits...

THE BODY is upon him now, flailing wildly. Geoff thrashes and 
struggles, screaming bloody murder.

Gradually, he realizes the body isn't fighting back. Geoff eases 
his struggle, lets his scream fall off.

Now he hears wild, mischievous LAUGHTER.

Drew pulls the body away. It's just a heavy wad of stuffed 
clothing: A DUMMY dressed in a negligee, capped by a blonde wig. 
It dangles near the end of a slanted wire.

Clyde, Stevie, Brad, and a half dozen other costumed KIDS appear 
from the nearby cover of bushes, doubled over in laughter.

Clyde tugs at a piece of twine that's connected to the back of the 
dummy's head and makes spooky sounds. The dummy jumps around on 
the slanted wire.

Clyde drops the dummy and saunters forward.

				CLYDE
		Look at this, Junior here
		practically shit his pants.

Clyde drops down, nose to nose with Geoff, who's still recovering.

				CLYDE
		Maybe you're too chicken to hang
		out with the rest of the boys.
		You gonna run home to Daddy now?

Geoff brushes himself off and rises to his feet. He stares into 
Clyde's eyes.

				GEOFF
		Fuck off.

Geoff pushes past Clyde and moves on into the graveyard, somehow 
managing to keep his dignity intact.

Drew follows, then the rest of the boys, leaving Clyde staring 
after them, standing alone with the dummy.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gus' squad car slows to a stop outside. Gus swings open the door 
and ambles toward the porch.

INT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Amanda draws back from the window, mortified. She nervously 
crosses to the refrigerator and grabs a beer, turning as Gus 
enters.

				AMANDA
		You're home early.

				GUS
		Nope. Just ran out of smokes.

Gus opens a kitchen drawer and fishes for a pack of cigarettes. He 
fires one up.

				GUS
		Where's the boy?

Amanda squirms.

				AMANDA
		Uh... in his room...

Gus tightens his brow, casting a suspicious eye.

A sickened look flushes through Amanda as Gus pulls his eyes away 
from her and marches upstairs.

				GUS (O.S.)
		DREW!

His feet POUND down the hallway. Silence for an instant. Then the 
powerful swing of Drew's door. Followed by Gus' hastened return 
down the hallway. And as he hustles down the stairs...

				GUS
		God damn it, Amanda! You want me
		to be a father to the boy, and as
		soon as I lay down the law, you
		let him break it!

Gus stops before Amanda.

				GUS
		Where is he?

One step away from terror, Amanda shakes her head. Gus loses his 
patience. He rips the can of beer from her grip and sends it 
flying across the room.

				GUS
		WHERE IS YOUR SON!?

Amanda sighs in quiet defeat.

				AMANDA
		The Pet Sematary.

Gus turns away and heads out the door.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Wheels spin as Gus' squad car streaks off into the night. The 
cherry top glows to life, bombarding the countryside.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

By now, nearly TWO DOZEN COSTUMED KIDS have gathered at the Pet 
Sematary. In the midst of the graves, a small story-telling 
campfire burns. A number of the boys sip beer, trying to pretend 
that the bitter after-taste doesn't bother them.

Clyde sits up front. At fourteen, he's the elder statesmen of the 
group. With a beer in one hand, and a cigarette in the other, 
Clyde is just finishing up a spooky yarn.

				CLYDE
		...yeah, that old Louis was one
		sick fuck... digging up little Gage
		like so, maggots pouring out of
		that kid's eyes...

Clyde whistles. He drags on his cigarette and puffs out a smoke 
ring. Sees he still has an audience.

				CLYDE
		Ellie was the only Creed that
		lived. Then one night a few
		months later, Ellie freaks out,
		and she hacks up her grandparents
		with an axe!
			(beat)
		Police found her licking their
		brains off the blade... They
		locked her up in a psycho ward and
		all she said were two words: 'Pet
		Sematary. Pet Sematary.'

Clyde stares at the wide-eyed kids. He grins, takes a swig of 
beer, and moves in for the kicker.

				CLYDE
		Oh yeah! Almost forgot! Here's
		the best part. Two nights ago she
		escapes. Word is, she was heading
		for Maine. Man I hope she doesn't
		show up out here.
			(feigning concern)
		Shit, we wouldn't even notice her,
		not if she's wearing a costume.
		She could be one of us...

Clyde casts a suspicious eye on the group. The kids uneasily look 
at each other, making sure they know who's behind each and every 
costume.

Suddenly Clyde drops his jaw in exaggerated horror.

				CLYDE
		Oh my Goddd!!!

Clyde lifts a trembling finger, pointing beyond the group of 
spellbound listeners.

				CLYDE
		It's... It's...

The kids are afraid to turn around, assuming Clyde's rigged up 
some unspeakable terror...

And for an instant, a look of real horror washes over Clyde's 
face...

A FIGURE

Is coming up the path beneath the archway, rising out of the 
swirling mist. A frightening silhouette, backlit by the moon.

But then Clyde realizes who it is.

				CLYDE
		Shit! It's Drew's Dad. It's
		fuckin' Gus!

Drew and the others quickly turn around, realizing it's not part 
of the punch-line scare.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

The kids quickly scramble for hiding places in the bordering 
brush, dropping their beer cans as fast as they can.

As Drew leaps to his feet, he upsets the fire, knocking one of the 
logs. A FLAMING EMBER rolls to the base of one of the brittle old 
crosses.

Drew and Geoff run for it.

EXT.  PATH, ARCHWAY - NIGHT

Gus moves quickly up the meandering path, sending the blinding 
beam of his flashlight over the graves.

				GUS
		You boys better not be drinking!

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

Through the thick woods, Drew is flanked by Geoff and Clyde.

				DREW
		Oh man, he's gonna kick my ass...

Drew starts to take off. Clyde trips him on his first stride. Drew 
hits the dirt.

				CLYDE
		Thanks for fucking up our
		Halloween, dumbshit!

Clyde recedes into the woods as Gus approaches the campfire. He 
scans the area with his flashlight, illuminating the various beer 
cans.

				GUS
		Drew, you get your ass out here!
		Front and center!

Geoff pulls Drew to his feet.

Gus passes the flashlight over the woods. Kids duck away, 
retreating from their hiding places...

The flashlight sweeps toward Drew.

Drew freezes, spotlighted by Gus' beam. A burst of LIGHTNING 
floods Drew's horrified face.

				GUS
		Get out here, Joker.

Geoff remains frozen in the woods nearby, out of Gus' light.

Behind Gus, the wooden cross is completely on fire now.

				GUS
		You out here making a fool of me?

Drew shakes his head in instant denial.

				GUS
		I'm warning you, buddy! You don't
		play by the rules, I'm gonna
		shadow your ass for eternity!

Drew makes a break from his spot in the woods. He weaves through 
the markers, arcing around the outer perimeter to avoid Gus...

...but Gus is quicker. He zigzags through the crosses and 
headstones to intercept Drew.

Gus gets a handful of Drew's collar and yanks him in.

				GUS
		You little shit!

Gus draws his free arm back and smacks Drew across the face. Drew 
goes down.

GEOFF

is looking on from the woods, horrified. Torn...

DREW

cowers on the ground, trying to scramble away.

Geoff bolts out into the firelight, staring defiantly at Gus in 
silent accusation.

Gus is beyond furious. LIGHTNING flashes again.

				GUS
		You get out of here, Geoff
		Matthews! This is between me and
		my boy!

Geoff doesn't move. Gus starts to advance forward...

...but the GROWL emanating from the woods gives him pause. 
Everyone turns...

A RUSTLING is heard in the bushes, and Zowie emerges into the 
building firelight, flashing his fangs at Gus. His eyes GLOW RED.

Gus freezes, studying Zowie.

Zowie inches forward, poised for the attack.

				GUS
		Call off your dog, Drew.

Drew shifts his eyes from Zowie to Gus, too terrified to heed such 
a command.

Zowie brushes past Drew and Geoff, moving in on Gus.

Gus' eyes shift to burning cross at his side. With a swift boot, 
he kicks over the cross and presses it into his grip.

Swinging the cross like a primitive weapon, Gus connects with the 
side of Zowie's head.

Zowie spins a full circle from the impact. But he lands on all 
fours. Unphased. Taking the next step toward Gus. There's 
something clearly not of this world in Zowie's vicious stare.

				GUS
			(terrified)
		Drew, call him off!

All Drew can manage is a faint appeal.

				DREW
		Zowie...

Zowie goes for Gus, launching into the air...

				GUS
		DREW!

...and sinking his glistening fangs into Gus' neck.

AN ERUPTION OF BLOOD showers the closest headstone.

Gus comes helplessly tumbling down with the weight of the dog. His 
SCREAMS are suddenly cut short as Zowie rips out his throat. His 
arms flail weakly at his sides, then grow still.

Drew and Geoff stare at the scene, wide-eyed with shock.

Zowie looks up from Gus' neck with dripping, red fangs. For a 
moment, his eyes settle on Drew. Then Zowie bolts off, 
disappearing into the night.

				DREW
		Oh, God. Oh, God...

Drew's eyes shift to Geoff, whose face is flushed with sickened 
fear.

				GEOFF
			(a whisper)
		Is he dead?

In dazed shock, Drew moves in for a closer look at the body.

Gus' eyes are wide open. Blood is still pumping in rhythm from his 
jugular with each weakening beat of his heart. It's a gruesome 
image against the roaring fire.

Drew kneels at Gus' side. He wants to touch him. To shake him 
awake, but with every attempt, he draws his hand back.

				GEOFF
		Is he breathing? Can you hear him
		breathing?

Drew leans forward, turning his ear toward Gus' gaping mouth. And 
as he inches closer...

GUS' FINGERS TWITCH

His hand jerks up and closes around Drew's neck. Gus stares up at 
him with his crazed menace.

Drew SCREAMS. His fingers claw at Gus' hand, desperate to pry it 
loose...

...but then, Gus' hand relaxes as his last, dying ounce of 
strength fades away.

Drew shrinks back, crouching over the lifeless body as the blazing 
firelight dances over it. He turns his tear-filled gaze to Geoff.

				DREW
		Oh man, Geoff... we killed him...
		we killed him...
			(beat)
		What're we gonna do?

Geoff draws closer and looks down into the dead man's face.

				GEOFF
		We could bring him back.

Drew's eyes widen at the suggestion.

And now, GAZING DOWN on Gus' body, and on the boys, WE PULL UP 
INTO A SLOW SPIRAL...

We move ever higher, until we are LOOKING DOWN UPON THE ENTIRE PET 
SEMATARY. At the SOUND of a shovel cutting into rocky soil, we...

Amanda is pacing back and forth on the porch, checking her watch 
every few steps. She sighs with relief as...

Drew appears from the darkness of the woods.

Drew dismounts his bike and carries it up the front porch steps, 
strangely silent. His clothes and face are caked with dirt.

				AMANDA

Drew moves on past her into the house.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase is in the study, perusing some files. He looks into the 
hallway as Geoff arrives home, then glances at the clock. It's 
late. Very late.

Chase rises. He's both angry and relieved. Right now, though, the 
anger's winning out.

				CHASE
		Were you drinking?

Geoff absently shakes his head. He slumps back against the wall, 
drained from the night's horrors.

				CHASE

		Where the hell were you boys?

Geoff shrugs, trying to mask his uneasiness.

		for crap like this. I don't care
		if it's Halloween... it's a school
		night, and if you do this again...

				GEOFF
			(cutting him off)
		I'm really tired, Dad... can I just
		go to sleep?

Chase stops and looks at his son. Geoff's exhaustion is self-
evident.

				CHASE
			(sighing)
		Go on... we'll talk about this in
		the morning.

Geoff nods and heads for the stairs.

INT.  GEOFF'S ROOM - NIGHT

THE CLOCK is creeping up on 2AM...

THUNDER rumbles outside in the distance and rain starts to spatter 
the window panes.

Geoff's eyelids fall beneath unbearable weight and he nods off to 
sleep. Tiger is sprawled out on the blanket against his chest. 
Slowly, we move back towards the window...

In a flash of LIGHTNING--

GUS' FACE

APPEARS OUTSIDE. Washed in the haunting white glow. Streaked with 
mud. Caked with blood. Staring in at Geoff.

Geoff is jolted awake by the delayed clap of THUNDER and whips his 
gaze to the window. Before he can focus...

...the pulse of lightning fades away. And with it, Gus' face. Only 
darkness remains beyond the window pane.

Geoff returns his gaze to the bedroom, unaware of Gus' appearance. 
He sinks back to his pillow, already hurtling towards sleep once 
more.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

MOVING IN ON the house, WE SINGLE OUT a rain-obscured window on 
the ground floor, the window to Drew's bedroom.

INT.  DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT

Drew is sound asleep, curled up under the sheets. He clutches his 
pillow like a life preserver.

				GUS (O.S.)
		Drew!

Drew's eyes flutter open. He turns towards the window. Now, he 
hears some activity outside. And then Gus' hushed voice.

				GUS (O.S.)
		Drew, buddy. I lost my keys.

Drew goes saucer-eyed. He swallows the swelling lump in his throat 
and rises from his bed.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Drew steadies his quivering fingers just enough to sink the key 
into the deadbolt on the back door. Drawing the CREAKING door 
open, he gazes out back.

				DREW
			(scared shitless)
		Gus?

Nothing moves outside. The longer Drew watches, the more eerie 
each shadow becomes. Spooked, Drew steps back inside, quickly 
closing the door. He locks it back up again.

When he turns around, he's face to face with GUS.

Drew stiffens, backing into the wall.

				DREW
		H-how'd you get in?

Gus offers a nightmarish grin and raises his hand, dangling his 
keys.

				GUS
		Found 'em.

Drew's eyes follow a flow of blood from Gus' neck to the floor. 
Gus looks down at his dirty, bloody footprints. He's tracked blood 
all over the linoleum.

				GUS
		I'm makin' a mess of your mother's
		kitchen floor...
			(beat)
		I need a shower...

Gus turns without another word and heads for the stairs.

Drew's mouth drops in utter astonishment as he watches Gus 
clumsily climbing the stairs.

After a moment, he returns his attention to the bloody kitchen 
floor. Tearing off a wad of paper towels, he wets them and begins 
to mop up Gus' tracks.

103   OMITTED

AT THE MIRROR - NIGHT

Gazing vacantly at his reflection, Gus covers his ravaged throat 
with a gauze strip, wrapping it around the circumference of his 
neck again and again and again.

Behind him, the shower is running, filling up the bathroom with 
steam.

Finishing the dressing off with a sloppy tape job, Gus reaches for 
the pajamas hanging nearby. He lazily buttons the buttons, failing 
to notice their alignment is off. He never did bother to shower. 
He's still covered with mud.

INT.  AMANDA AND GUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gus enters from the steamy bathroom. The shower is still running.

Amanda stirs, sleepy eyes focusing on him.

				AMANDA
		Gus, hon. I'm sorry about
		tonight. You coming to bed?

Gus lifts the covers and climbs in. With him comes the chill of 
death. Gus presses up behind her. His hand moves beneath the 
sheets, finding its way over the curve of her waist, caressing. 
Amanda shivers.

				AMANDA
		God, you're ice cold...
			(turning)
		...and you smell! Lord, what did
		you get yourself into?

It's then that Amanda sees the bandage around Gus' neck. Blood is 
seeping through the gauze.

				AMANDA
		My God, Gus, what happened?

Amanda reaches out to touch him, but Gus stops her hand short of 
the bandage. Instead, he leans forward and clutches one of her 
breasts.

Amanda tries to twist away.

				AMANDA
		Gus... stop it! What's wrong with
		you?!

But Gus doesn't stop. He throws himself on top of Amanda, roughly 
forcing her back onto the bed.

				AMANDA
		Gus!!!

Amanda's hands beat at Gus' face and back, to no apparent effect. 
With one arm forced against Amanda's throat, he rips open her 
nightgown with the other.

We pull away from Amanda's struggles, back to the bathroom. The 
shower running on and on, cloaking the bedroom in steam.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Geoff is riding along the highway, his backpack full of school 
books. Drew is waiting on the shoulder ahead. When Geoff 
approaches, Drew hops on his bike, getting up to speed.

WITH THE BOYS - RIDING

Geoff keeps glancing at Drew, waiting for him to say something. 
Drew maintains his enigmatic expression.

				GEOFF
		Well?

Drew nods. Geoff's eyes widen in disbelief.

				DREW
		Picture this... Gus comes down to
		breakfast and he doesn't say a
		word. He even kind of smiles,
		like he forgot he hates me. And
		then you know what he does? He
		serves me an extra helping of
		pancakes...
			(beat)
		I asked him if I was still
		grounded... "no." I asked him if
		you could spend the night, and he
		nods. It's like we're a family.
		A real family.

The words have their own meaning for Geoff, who stares to the road 
ahead in deep thought.

				DREW
		It's weird...

				GEOFF
		What do you mean?

				DREW
		It's like he's not Gus anymore.
		He's different. You know, like
		Zowie...

They share a chuckle that ends in silent uneasiness.

INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY

Chase enters with a stack of files tucked under his arm. As he 
organizes them in the large filing cabinet with the others, he 
listens to his messages on the answering machine.

The current caller sounds a little annoyed...

				MESSAGE MACHINE
		...Doctor Matthews, this is
		Elliot Rudman at the university.
		I've looked over the blood
		specimen you sent us on canine
		Zowie...

Chase abandons the filing and immediately returns the call. While 
it RINGS...

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Knock, Knock, Doc.

A MOTHER and TWO TODDLERS are standing in the doorway to Chase's 
office, trying not to intrude on his call.

				MOTHER
			(quiet whisper)
		We saw your sign. Are there any
		kitties left?

Chase studies them. They look like decent people.

				CHASE
		Take your pick. They're in the
		boarding area. You can go on
		back.

Chase turns away as his phone call is answered.

				CHASE
		Elliot, it's Chase...

INT.  LAB/INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE (INTERCUT) - DAY

ELLIOT RUDMAN has the phone tucked under his chin, in the midst of 
an autopsy. The WHIRR of the saw drowns out his words as he shaves 
the dome off a dog's skull.

				CHASE
		I didn't get that...

The pathologist turns off the saw. His words become audible.

				RUDMAN
		...I said next time it might help
		if you took the blood sample while
		the animal was still alive...

The comment hits Chase out of left field.

				CHASE
		What?

				RUDMAN
		I don't know what you expected to
		find, Matthews. There's nothing
		wrong with the antigens, nothing
		to indicate an unusual death...

				CHASE
		Wait, there must be some mix-up.
		He was... the dog is alive.

				RUDMAN
		Not this dog. There wasn't enough
		oxygen in those red cells to pump
		life into a flea.

Chase is baffled, speechless.

				RUDMAN
		You took over for Doctor Yolander?

				CHASE
		Yes... why?

				RUDMAN
		Because the last person that sent
		me blood from a dead animal was
		Yolander...

INT.  BOARDING AREA - DAY

The kennels have been cleaned up, but the room retains its eerie, 
dimly lit quality.

The DRIP of a faucet reverberates from the far corner.

The mother enters with a toddler clinging to each hand. Their 
smiles fade at the unsettling surroundings. Slowly, they move down 
the row of kennels.

				TODDLER
		Where are the kitties?

INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY

				CHASE
			(into the phone)
		Look, this is ridiculous...

Suddenly, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS pierce the air. Chase drops the 
phone and rushes out of the office...

INT.  BOARDING AREA - DAY

The toddlers are screaming at the top of their lungs. Mom is 
burying their heads in her dress.

Chase bursts in as the mother hastily retreats for the exit. Her 
horrified eyes flash by Chase. In an instant, she and the toddlers 
are gone.

Chase remains alone, moving down the long row of kennels with 
mounting trepidation...

Zowie's cage is empty.

Chase shifts his troubled gaze to the...

DRIP DRIP DRIP... as a PUDDLE OF BLOOD forms on the floor.

Chase raises his eyes...

THE KITTENS' KENNEL -

Nothing but bloody ribbons of torn flesh are left of the kittens, 
dangling from the grid gate. DRIPPING.

Chase looks away as a new level of fear runs through him.

				CHASE
		Jesus...

It's too gruesome even for a man of Chase's background. Fighting 
the gag reflex, he searches the room for the missing dog...

...and then he spots the broken glass window vent along the floor. 
And the pile of blood-spattered shards laying on the tile.

EXT.  SCHOOL, STREET - DAY

Clyde, Stevie, and Brad are loitering near the front bike racks. 
Clyde's smoking away.

As Geoff and Drew come out of the school, the trio moves to 
intercept them.

				CLYDE
		Hey!

Just then, Chase's van pulls at the curb, interrupting whatever 
trouble was about to happen.

Clyde looks from the van to Geoff, and falls back.

				DREW
		Saved by the bell...

Chase hurriedly rolls down the passenger window as Geoff and Drew 
approach.

				GEOFF
		Can I sleep over at Drew's
		tonight?

Chase is preoccupied with other concerns.

				CHASE
		Yeah... that's fine...
			(beat)
		Listen, Drew, I got the tests back
		on Zowie. He's not well. Don't
		ask me how, but he got out this
		afternoon...

Geoff and Drew exchange concerned looks.

				CHASE
		If he finds his way home, call me,
		no matter what the hour, okay? And
		don't try to approach him.
		Whatever he's got might be 
		infectious. Understand?

The boys nod their heads.

Chase masks his anxiety with a weary smile. With a wave, he speeds 
up, leaving the boys.

INT.  CHASE'S VAN - MOVING

A MAP of Maine is unfolded on the passenger seat. Chase is on the 
car phone.

				CHASE
		Can I have the address for Quentin
		Yolander?

Chase jots an address down on the map. He turns the van up a 
mountain road, winding through the towering pines.

EXT.  YOLANDER'S CABIN - DAY

A remote, rustic dwelling nestled into the desolate backwoods.

INT.  YOLANDER'S CABIN - DAY

QUENTIN YOLANDER rocks back in his thick hide chair. His world is 
closed off from daylight by the extensive blinds.

He's holding a SMALL POODLE in his lap. Its big brown eyes are 
staring back at him.

				YOLANDER
		You'd be so much more interesting
		with blue eyes...

And now, ONE OF THE POODLE'S EYES POPS OUT. Yolander's finger 
comes through from beneath the eye socket.

On closer examination, WE REALIZE that the dog is not alive at 
all. Yolander has his hand inside the hollowed-out carcass.

He carefully looks over a container of glass eyes on his desk and 
selects the right shade of blue. A shot of whiskey rests nearby.

Yolander reaches up into the poodle's belly and fits the blue eyes 
securely into place.

There's a KNOCK at the door. Yolander ignores it. Maybe he's deaf. 
Another KNOCK. Yolander turns towards the door, annoyed at the 
intrusion. And behind that annoyance, there's a touch of madness.

PULLING BACK, we see the rest of the room. Stuffed animals are 
crowded from floor to ceiling. A product of Yolander's obsession 
with TAXIDERMY.

				YOLANDER
		I'm immortalizing a poodle. State
		your business!

Yolander presses some stuffing into the poodle's gut and begins to 
sew up the stomach.

				CHASE (O.S.)
		Doctor Yolander. This is Chase
		Matthews. I've moved into your
		offices in Ludlow...

Yolander's attention remains on the needle as he meticulously 
stitches the belly.

				CHASE (O.S.)
			(continuing)
		...I sent a blood sample out for
		analysis. They tell me I sent
		them the blood of a dead animal...

At this, Yolander breaks his concentration. The needle pricks his 
hand. Blood oozes from the puncture, dripping onto the dog's 
stomach.

				CHASE (O.S.)
		...a dog...

Yolander rises from his seat and swings open the door.

Chase stands in the doorway, startled. It doesn't take a genius to 
figure out that the good Doctor is drunk.

				YOLANDER
			(glaring)
		Why are you bothering me about
		this? Can't you leave it be?

				CHASE
		I... um...

Chase glances to the right and steps back...

A BOBCAT

is perched nearby, frozen in mid-pounce. It takes a second for 
Chase to register that the bobcat has been stuffed.

Now Chase sees the rest of the room... a whole zoo of stuffed 
animals, looking like a rural version of the Bates Motel.

				CHASE
			(momentarily thrown)
		...the pathologist... he said that
		you had reported a similar 
		incident... with a cat...

				YOLANDER
		The Creed cat, that's right.
		Bastard's name was "Church".
			(grins)
		Let me guess. Your dog's tissue
		isn't healing, pupils aren't
		dilating... maybe you can't find a
		heartbeat?

				CHASE
		Exactly! I thought it might be
		some sort of blood condition...
		immune deficiency or...

Quentin Yolander laughs. It's disconcerting.

				YOLANDER
		There's no "blood condition." The
		dog isn't sick, it's dead.
			(drawing closer)
		And so was Creed's cat. And so
		was his wife the night she was
		killed for the second time...

As Yolander moves forward, Chase backs up. He bumps into a whole 
shelf of stuffed creatures. To his right, A RAVEN sits frozen on 
its perch. Chase regards Yolander as being completely insane.

				YOLANDER
			(menacing)
		You want some advice, friend? You
		get in your car, you pick up your
		family... and you get the hell out
		of that town.

				CHASE
		Well... uh... thanks...

Chase continues to back out of the door. On his way out, he bumps 
into the stuffed raven's perch...

...only this raven isn't stuffed. It spreads its wings and 
SCREECHES.

Chase just about jumps out of his skin, tripping out of the 
doorway.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gus reaches into the cage and grabs a rabbit by the ears. He 
casually snaps the neck. Laying the limp carcass on a stump 
cutting board, he quickly skins it.

Hanging above the cages, there is now a line of furry pelts. Half 
a dozen.

Drew and Geoff are on the porch, looking on.

				DREW
		I guess we're having rabbit for
		dinner.

Gus hangs the freshly skinned fur to dry and violently snatches 
another hare from the cage.

INT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The dinner from Hell. Geoff splats a helping of mashed potatoes 
onto his plate, all the while keeping a wary eye on Gus...

Gus is serving himself a chunk of rabbit. It hits the edge of the 
plate, teetering on the rim. He passes the dish on.

Gus meets Geoff's gaze. For a moment, there's a deadened, vacant 
look in Gus' eyes. Then slowly, a limp smile creeps over him, 
sending a chill up Geoff's spine.

Geoff averts Gus' stare. Gus helps himself to potatoes and passes 
the plate on. He lets go of it short of reaching Drew. Only Drew's 
quick hands save it from hitting the table.

Amanda comes to the table with a dish of LIMA BEANS. She casts Gus 
a cold, hateful stare and sets the limas down. She's still angry 
over last night.

Gus dishes a sloppy scoop and passes it toward Drew. Like before, 
he lets it drop too early. This time Drew doesn't save it. The 
lima beans shower the floor.

				AMANDA
		God damnit, Gus! This isn't
		funny!

Amanda fetches a dishtowel and kneels to clean up the mess.

Geoff and Drew exchange quick glances. As Geoff reaches for the 
salt...

...Gus intercepts his wrist. Geoff gulps.

Gus drops his jaw, revealing a gooey mass of food. But the frozen 
smile and the look in his eyes convey dementia rather than 
playfulness.

Geoff and Drew can't believe their eyes. They laugh uncomfortably. 
There's no other response.

Gus LAUGHS too... awkward, terrible laughter. Spitting out food 
over his shirt and plate as he does so.

The boys stop laughing, but Gus just keeps on going.

Amanda stares at Gus and carries the mess out of the room.

Through his laughter, Gus' bandage has slipped down, exposing part 
of his ragged wound. The wound glistens, oozing CLOTTED BLOOD and 
GOOEY PUS.

Drew hesitantly reaches for Gus' neck, readjusting the bandage.

Grossed out, Geoff averts his eyes and sets his fork aside.

INT.  DREW'S ROOM - LATER

Geoff and Drew enter. Drew swiftly secures the deadbolts on his 
door.

				GEOFF
		What was that all about? You
		think he's trying to scare us?

				DREW
		I don't know but I'm not taking
		any chances...

Drew opens the chest at the foot of his bed and produces a 
SHOTGUN. A box full of shells spill as he withdraws the gun. 
Cracking open the chamber, Drew loads two shells into the chamber.

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

A moonlit horizon. Unmoving. Silent. The kind of silence that 
pulls at the darkest recesses of imagination.

And now, A LONE FIGURE appears on the horizon. It's Zowie, moving 
at a deliberate pace.

ATOP A KNOLL

Zowie takes pause. The TINKLING of his collar tags resumes as he 
drops over the horizon line, cutting down the hill.

INT.  CHASE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase sits in the den, looking exhausted and disheveled. In front 
of him, the t.v. is on. RENEE'S FACE stares out at us. Chase hits 
the remote and rises, moving to the back door.

He checks the deadbolt, then secures the chain link as a backup. 
From somewhere outside, we hear a DOG HOWL.

Chase's eyes drop to the DOGGY DOOR, a holdover from the previous 
owner. Chase bends down and latches the door.

Now he pauses at his desk... considers... then pulls something out 
of the bottom drawer. It's a gun.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Chase moves to the front of the house, securing that door. 
Satisfied, he turns off the light and heads upstairs...

WE STAY AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS -

MOVING INTO DARKNESS, shadow and form begin to take shape. We hear 
a low GROWL and see a flash of RED EYES. It's Zowie. Already in 
the house.

123   OMITTED

INT.  CHASE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Coming through the door from the downstairs, Chase stops cold.

RENEE is on the bed. Clothed in a negligee. Lying across a blanket 
of rose petals. Her eyes meet his with powerful longing.

				RENEE
		Chase. I miss you so much...

				CHASE
			(dry-mouthed)
		Renee...

Chase approaches. Slowly. Fearful that this is all a dream.

Renee reaches out her hand. They touch. This is not a dream.

				CHASE
		Oh God...

Chase absently sets his gun on the bedside table as Renee draws 
his body to hers.

They kiss. Once. Twice. Not a dream.

Renee rolls Chase over, forcefully climbing on top. Chase sinks 
down into the center of the bed as Renee straddles him.

Slowly, Renee slips off the top of her negligee...

				RENEE
			(a whisper)
		I can come back, Chase...

...and sinks down on top of him, kissing him hungrily.

Her nipples graze his chest, then her breasts flatten as she 
grinds her hips against his.

Almost instantly, the weight of her grows unbearable. Chase fights 
to pull his mouth from hers, to breathe...

				CHASE
		No... Too heavy.

There is no pleasure in his words, just unmitigated horror as 
Renee's body comes down on him harder.

				CHASE
		...can't breathe... I can't...

CHASE'S EYES

pop open, frenzied, AS HE COMES OUT OF HIS DREAM.

Chase is alone on the bed, but he's still feeling the weight 
pressing down on him...

ZOWIE

is laying on his chest, staring back at him, rearing his teeth in 
a growl...

Zowie LUNGES forward, jaws flashing, and Chase twists sideways...

GNASHING TEETH connect with Chase's shoulder, then with the 
pillows where Chase's head used to be. A BLIZZARD OF DOWN FEATHERS 
ERUPTS...

Chase scrambles out of bed, flailing for the gun on the bedside 
table...

THE GUN spins out of reach and across the floor...

Chase DIVES for the gun and reaches it just as Zowie leaps to the 
floor. In a panic, Chase FIRES WILD...

Zowie abruptly turns and SMASHES through the bedroom window, 
sending glass flying.

EXT.  HOUSE - NIGHT

Zowie slides down the room and leaps to the ground below, 
disappearing into the night.

INT.  CHASE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Chase looks on in terror. Finally he pulls his eyes away from the 
shattered window...

...and catches a glimpse of something in the dresser mirror. 
Something that sends a chill up his spine.

The flurry of down feathers is floating to the mattress. But 
intermingling with the feathers are a handful of ROSE PETALS, 
slowly settling to the bed.

INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

Chase is bare-chested at the mirror, applying a dressing to the 
dog bite on his shoulder.

Marjorie appears in the doorway with a basket of laundry. She 
stops short at the sight of Chase standing there in his boxers.

Chase catches her reflection in the mirror and is startled.

				MARJORIE
		I didn't mean to... I was going to
		empty the hamper...

Chase turns, shaking off the scare.

				CHASE
		It's okay.

Marjorie's eyes can't help but fix on the dog bites scattered over 
Chase's chest and arms.

				MARJORIE
		What happened to you?

				CHASE
		I had a little run-in with Zowie.

				MARJORIE
		You sure did...

Marjorie sets the laundry aside.

				MARJORIE
		Here, let me do that...

Marjorie looks over the antiseptics Chase has laid out on the 
sink. Saturating a wad of gauze with hydrogen peroxide, she gently 
cleanses the gashes on his arms.

There's nothing overtly sexual in her actions, but the gentleness 
of her touch doesn't go unnoticed by Chase.

				MARJORIE
		I hope he doesn't have rabies.

				CHASE
		He doesn't. I don't know what he
		has, but I'm hoping to God it's
		not infectious...

Chase stops and looks at Marjorie's reflection in the mirror.

				CHASE
		Marjorie... what do you know about
		the Creed murders?

Marjorie stiffens for a moment. Obviously the Creeds are a sore 
spot for the people in this town.

				MARJORIE
		Did you ever play that game where
		you pass a story down a row of
		people and see how screwed up it
		gets by the time it's done?
		People say Louis Creed's son came
		back from the dead and it drove
		him crazy...
			(she rolls her eyes)
		He killed his wife and himself,
		and that's the end of story.
		Anything else belongs in the
		National Enquirer.

Marjorie tapes the bandage over Chase's shoulder too tight. 
Chase's groan snaps her back to the reality at hand.

				MARJORIE
		Sorry. Now tell me what that has
		to do with Zowie?

Chase closes his eyes, shutting out the pain.

				CHASE
		I wish I knew.

INT.  LIBRARY - DAY

Chase approaches the counter, looking to the ELDERLY LIBRARIAN for 
assistance.

				LIBRARIAN
		What are you looking for, Hon.

				CHASE
		Do you have anything on the Creed
		murders? I can't find the 
		microfilm from that period...

The librarian's smile vanishes. She lowers her voice, focusing her 
attention on some paperwork.

				LIBRARIAN
		We don't keep anything on file
		from that far back.

				CHASE
		But you've got files from the
		previous years...

				LIBRARIAN
		We have nothing on the Creed
		murders, sir. Can I get you
		something else?

Chase looks around and realizes that a dozen hostile eyes are on 
him. TOWNSPEOPLE withholding a dark secret.

Chase slowly backs away, eager to escape the field of hostile 
stares.

EXT.  HIGHWAY, COUNTRY BRIDGE - DAY

Geoff and Drew have parked their bikes beneath the bridge. They 
sit on the bank of the creek below, watching the water run past. 
Geoff is lost in thought.

				GEOFF
		Do you think everyone that came
		back would be like Gus?

				DREW
		I don't know...
			(thinking)
		...maybe it depends on what you
		were like before you...

				GEOFF
			(finishing)
		Dies?

Drew nods. He tosses a stone into the creek, then looks up at the 
sun and sighs.

				DREW
		I gotta go back and do my
		chores...

				GEOFF
		Go later...

Drew shakes his head.

				DREW
		I can't. Gus'd kill me if I
		showed up late.

The boys reluctantly rise and move to their bikes, walking them up 
the steep grade to the highway.

				DREW
		See you at school Monday?

Geoff nods. He looks at Drew. The boy is genuinely frightened. But 
there's nothing either of them can do. They're trapped in their 
roles as kids.

Both boys mount their bikes. Drew turns...

				DREW
		You ever think about running away?

				GEOFF
		All the time.

Drew smiles at this. He waves to Geoff and pedals off.

				DREW
			(calling back)
		See ya!

Geoff waves and heads off in the opposite direction.

WE STAY ON DREW -

As he moves down the road. Up ahead, we hear the approaching WHINE 
of a motorcycle...

CLYDE

rips by on an old junkyard fixer-up MOTORCYCLE, and he's heading 
in Geoff's direction.

Seeing him, Drew brakes and pulls his bike into a U-turn, pumping 
furiously to catch up with Geoff.

ON GEOFF -

Now Geoff hears the WHINE of Clyde's motorcycle. He glances 
back...

Clyde's spotted him, REVVING the engine.

Geoff pedals like mad, but it's no use. Clyde is closing in on 
him, grinning sadistically.

Clyde sweeps in next to him, calling out over the ENGINE.

				CLYDE
		Well look who's here!

Clyde veers right, forcing Geoff towards the shoulder of the 
road...

131   OMITTED

132   OMITTED

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The ground ahead drops toward a ravine. Geoff has nowhere to go 
but down the slope. Clyde is right there beside him...

Laughing, Clyde reaches over and grabs ahold of Geoff's handlebar. 
He jerks it sideways...

				CLYDE
		Oops!

Geoff's front wheel turns perpendicular. The bike pitches forward, 
THROWING Geoff into the dirt ahead...

Clyde broadies his bike to a stop. With the engine idling, he hops 
off.

Before Geoff can get to his feet, Clyde has picked up Geoff's bike 
and planted it upside down in the dirt.

				CLYDE
		Guess your Dad's not here to save
		you now, is he?

Clyde gets a handful of Geoff's collar and drags him over toward 
the bike. With his free hand, Clyde cranks the pedal.

The back wheel spins. Faster and faster.

				CLYDE
		You ever seen a tire take off a
		nose?

Through the blur of the spokes, WE SEE Geoff, eyes widening 
fearfully.

				CLYDE
		Neither have I.

Clyde forces Geoff's face toward the spinning tread.

				CLYDE
		Might even kill ya. Wheel might
		chew right into your brains. You
		could visit your mom.

Geoff tries to get a hold on the frame of the bike for leverage, 
but his arms don't reach beyond the spinning wheel.

Clyde is full of deranged glee, fueled by Geoff's fear.

But now, A HAND grabs the wool scarf streaming from the back of 
Clyde's neck and yanks him off of Geoff.

Clyde reels, finding...

GUS standing there behind him. He looks bad. Real bad. His 
bandages are unwound and his ruined neck is still seeping. His 
face is unearthly pale. He's deteriorated considerably since 
yesterday.

				CLYDE
			(startled)
		Jesus Christ, Gus!

Gus levels a threatening gaze at Geoff.

				GUS
		Go home.

But Geoff remains frozen. Gus fixes him with a stare that could 
turn flesh to stone.

				GUS
		I said... GO HOME!!

Geoff snaps out of it and flips his bike over. He gets a running 
start, making a beeline for the highway without ever looking back.

ON THE KNOLL NEARBY

Drew stops short of the ravine, watching from afar as Gus steps 
toward Clyde.

BELOW -

Clyde throws up his hands. He's frightened, but he tries to muster 
up a cocky front.

				CLYDE
		Come on, Gus, I was just fucking
		with him...
			(nervous laughter)
		What're you gonna do? Give me a
		ticket? I mean, shit, Gus...

Clyde grows increasingly wary of Gus' evil stare. Gus steps 
closer.

				CLYDE
		You can't lay a finger on me...

Wrong. Gus lashes out, backhanding Clyde across the face.

Clyde falls to the ground, flat on his back, with his nose gushing 
blood. Terrified.

Gus turns around and lifts the idling motorcycle. With one hand 
under the back of the seat, and the other working the accelerator 
handlebar, Gus advances toward Clyde.

Gus kicks the bike into gear and REVS the accelerator.

THE REAR WHEEL SPINS. On the pavement it would be moving forty 
miles an hour.

Clyde can't believe his eyes. Pleading.

				CLYDE
		Gus... what are you doing?

				GUS
		I'm just fucking with you...

Gus plants his foot against Clyde's chest, pinning him, and lowers 
the spinning rear wheel TOWARD CLYDE'S NECK. The wheel WHINES like 
a circular saw.

Gus lowers the wheel. Then jerks it away, flashing a sadistic 
smile.

Just when Clyde thinks Gus is backing off, the wheel comes down 
again...

				CLYDE
			(wailing)
		Stop it, man! Stop it!!!

Gus gets into the rhythm as he lowers and retracts the spinning 
wheel at the terrified bully.

But this time, as the wheel comes down...

CLYDE'S WOOL SCARF, defying gravity, gets swept up, swallowed into 
the GEARS.

And along with the scarf, here comes Clyde's SCREAMING face. We 
can only imagine the gruesome instant that follows.

BLOOD sprays up over Gus' arms and chest. And then we hear the 
sound of CRUNCHING BONES jamming the motorcycle's gears.

				GUS
			(dead-pan)
		Whoops.

He bares his teeth in a death's head grin.

ON THE KNOLL

Drew has witnessed the killing. He's mortified.

BELOW -

Gus tosses the bloody motorcycle aside, slowly raising his eyes up 
to where Drew stands. His eyes meet Drew's.

Drew hastily jerks his bike around and takes off.

Gus starts after him on foot.

INT.  DREW'S HOUSE - DAY

Drew rushes through the front door, SLAMMING it behind him and 
throwing the deadbolt.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

Drew climbs onto his bed and grabs his shotgun from the gun rack. 
His fingers shake as he flips off the safety.

				DREW
		Oh man...

Just then we hear the CRACKLE of a POLICE P.A. and Gus' amplified 
VOICE coming from the yard outside.

				GUS (V.O.)
			(mocking)
		This is the Police, come out of
		the house with your hands up!

Gus finishes his words with a burst of FEEDBACK and then amplified 
MANIACAL LAUGHTER.

Drew's eyes go wide with terror. He creeps out into the hall, 
clutching the gun.

INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

Drew tries to look out the window. Then we hear a low, guttural 
GROWL. Drew slowly turns...

Zowie is standing down the hall, leveling a dead stare. Zowie 
takes the first step forward.

				DREW
			(horrified)
		No, Zowie! It's me!

Pleading, Drew slowly retreats down the hallway.

Along the way, he backs right into...

GUS, grinning from ear to ear.

Drew recoils against the wall, swinging up his shotgun.

				DREW
		Stay back!

But Gus just keeps on grinning. He takes a step forward...

Drew pulls the trigger...

And CLICK! Nothing happens. The chambers are empty.

				GUS
		Forget something, Drew buddy?

Gus raises his hand. He's holding the shotgun shells. He lets them 
fall to the floor.

Suddenly Gus wrenches the gun from Drew's hands. He swings it 
and...

...Drew SCREAMS and ducks beneath the blow, as the shotgun butt 
SMASHES a hole in the wall above his head. Gus flings the shotgun 
aside and LUNGES for Drew...

Drew races down the hallway to the back door. He turns the latch. 
The deadbolt has been locked from the inside.

Drew's eyes whip to the keyholder on the wall. All the keyhooks 
are empty.

Here comes the JINGLING of keys in Gus' pockets as he comes down 
the hall...

Drew dashes away from the back door.

Gus' eyes shift from Drew's fleeing form to A BOX OF TOOLS in the 
service closet.

AT THE FRONT DOOR

Drew jimmies the knob. Again, the deadbolt is locked from the 
inside. Tears are streaming down Drew's face now.

FOOTSTEPS approach. Drew spins around...

Gus is advancing, WITH A HAMMER tight in his grip.

				GUS
			(crazed)
		You have the right to remain
		silent...

WHAM! Gus SMASHES the hammer into the wall to punctuate his words. 
Plaster goes flying.

				GUS
			(continuing)
		...while I bash your fucking head
		in!

Drew's eyes dart frantically, looking for a way out. The closest 
route of escape is UP THE STAIRS.

Down the hallway, Zowie starts running forward. Drew's caught 
between a rock and a hard place...

				GUS
		You have the right to a lawyer,
		but you won't need one...

He runs for it. Gus charges to intercept him...

Drew gets to the stairs first.

				GUS
		...cause you'll be dead!

WHAM! Gus brings the hammer down with the claw end leading. It 
sinks into the stair below Drew's feet...

Zowie LEAPS past Gus, tearing up the stairs as Gus wrenches the 
hammer free...

UPSTAIRS

Drew makes it to the top of the stairs with Zowie right on his 
heels.

Drew DIVES into Amanda and Gus' bedroom as...

Zowie springs from the floor. Drew SLAMS the door shut, SMACKING  
Zowie. Zowie collapses to the floor, dazed.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

Drew throws the latch on the door. Almost immediately, Gus is 
outside, POUNDING at the door with the claw end of the hammer. 
Wood splinters fly as the hammer claw sinks through...

Drew SCREAMS and goes for one of the dormer windows. It's stuck; 
he can't get it open.

From the hallway, Gus violently SMASHES the door again and again. 
The door is splintering apart. WE SEE glimpses of Gus through the 
ragged holes.

				GUS (O.S.)
		Do you understand these rights,
		Drew buddy?!

Drew grabs a chair and HEAVES it through the window...

				GUS (O.S.)
		...OR ARE YOU JUST TOO FUCKING
		STUPID?!

The bedroom door EXPLODES INWARD and Gus claws his way into the 
room...

Wasting no time, Drew climbs through the broken window...

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - DAY

Drew slides down the slant of the roof. He hits the lattice and 
takes it to the ground with him.

Untangling himself, he gets to his feet...

...and here comes Amanda, ARRIVING HOME.

Drew runs for her car, waving his hands, throwing himself into her 
path so she'll go no further. She SLAMS on the brakes.

Drew pulls open the passenger door and dives inside...

				DREW
		Gus killed Clyde, Mom! He's
		trying to kill me!

Just then, the BACK DOOR flies open. Gus steps out.

				GUS
		Drew, buddy! Daddy's not done
		yet!

Amanda spots the hammer hanging from his grip. Gus cracks a sick 
smile and FLINGS THE HAMMER at the car...

CRACK! The hammer bounces off the windshield, causing it to 
spiderweb.

				DREW
		Go Mom! Go!!!

That's all the convincing Amanda needs. She puts the car into 
reverse and stomps on the gas...

INT.  CAR - DAY

Speeding down the highway. Drew and Amanda are mortified.

Suddenly, we hear the WAIL of Gus' patrol car coming up from 
behind. Amanda looks to the rear-view mirror...

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

Approaching from the road ahead is a POTATO TRUCK.

INT.  AMANDA'S CAR - DAY

Amanda hips her head back in front of them. The potato truck is 
blaring its HORN.

Gus' car swerves out onto the shoulder, speeding up to match her 
pace.

				DREW
		Mom!!!

Gus cranks the wheel, jumping back onto the road, forcing Amanda's 
car into the path of the oncoming truck.

INT.  POTATO TRUCK - DAY

THE DRIVER stands on the BRAKES.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

THE POTATO TRUCK COLLIDES WITH AMANDA'S CAR. HEAD ON.

Thousands of potatoes explode from the rear of the truck, 
obscuring our view.

WE HEAR THE HORRIFYING SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING METAL. CRUNCHING BONES. 
AND SILENCED CRIES.

Gus' vehicle speeds past. WE HOLD on the mess of twisted steel. 
Clearly there are no survivors.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - DUSK

Geoff enters first. Wearing a dark suit. Looking pale and empty 
inside. Chase follows, dressed in black. It's obvious they've been 
to a funeral.

Without a word, Geoff heads up the stairs. Chase watches on, 
feeling utterly helpless.

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Chase exits from his bedroom, pulling a sweater over a more casual 
change of clothes. He cocks his head at the SOUNDS of Geoff moving 
about in the attic above.

The door atop the attic stairway is barely ajar.

Chase wrinkles his brow, concerned. Turning away, he heads 
downstairs.

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

Marjorie is preparing dinner. Across the room, the kitchen TV is 
playing...

ON TELEVISION is the evening news. A photo of Drew and Amanda 
appears above the NEWSCASTER.

				NEWSCASTER
		... Friends and neighbors came to
		pay respects for Drew and Amanda
		Gilbert, who died in a head-on
		collision Saturday...

Chase enters the kitchen, eyes moving to the TV.

				MARJORIE
		Those poor people. I saw Gus this
		morning... he looked terrible.

Chase pulls his eyes away from the broadcast as Marjorie sets 
dinner on the table. Chase yells upstairs.

				CHASE
		Geoff, dinner's ready!
			(after no reply)
		Geoff?!

				GEOFF (O.S.)
		I'm not hungry.

Chase gives Marjorie an apologetic look and rises from the table.

Meanwhile, the news broadcast continues. A photo of Clyde appears 
on the screen.

				NEWSCASTER
		...in other news, the
		disappearance of a Ludlow youth
		remains a mystery. Clyde Parker
		was last seen on Saturday
		afternoon. His motorcycle was
		found off Highway 62...

150   OMITTED

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Chase pushes open the door. A spring coil pulls the CREAKING door 
closed behind him. One look at the attic and Chase turns pale...

A huge window at the far end of the room allows the moonlight to 
reach all corners of the spacious old attic...

All of Renee's belongings have been unpacked. The entire attic has 
been converted into a museum-like room, down to the last 
meticulous detail. A room in preparation for Renee's return.

Gauzy curtains billow out from some unseen draft. Pictures of 
Renee rest everywhere. Awards. Memorabilia...

GEOFF is seated before the brightly lit, three-way theatrical 
mirror, casually setting out Renee's make-up.

				CHASE
		Geoff... what are you doing?

There's an obsessive dementia in Geoff's gaze.

				GEOFF
		I'm getting things ready for Mom.

Chase sighs. Obviously the strain of Drew's funeral has proven too 
much for Geoff. He moves closer.

				CHASE
			(gently)
		Mom is dead, Geoff. You know
		that...

A creepy smile flickers across Geoff's face.

				GEOFF
		She doesn't have to be.

Chase freezes as a chill runs up his spine.

				CHASE
		What are you talking about?

				GEOFF
		I can bring her back. The same
		way Drew and me brought Zowie
		back...

At this, Chase is positively spooked.

				CHASE
		Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie
		didn't die.

				GEOFF
		He did. We buried him.
			(intense)
		There's a place out in the
		woods... if you bury something
		there, it comes back alive.

Chase stares at his son. This is insane. It must be.

Just then, the PHONE RINGS downstairs. Geoff continues to stare at 
his father.

				GEOFF
		We tried it on Zowie first. And
		then we did it again, when Zowie
		killed Gus. Drew didn't want Gus
		to be dead, so we brought him
		back, too...

It's too much for Chase. His mouth is hanging agape.

				MARJORIE (O.S.)
			(outside the attic
			door)
		Doctor Matthews, you've got a
		call. It's the caretaker at the
		funeral home. Something about
		your wife's grave...

Chase nods in private acknowledgement. He stares at Geoff as he 
backs away.

				CHASE
		Look, Geoff. Just... just relax,
		okay. I'm going to take this call
		and I'll be right back. Okay?

Geoff doesn't respond. Chase pulls open the door and leaves.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Chase is on the phone. The CALLER'S WORDS bring grave concern to 
Chase.

				CHASE
		What?! Christ, I'll be right
		there...

Chase hangs up, stunned. He turns to Marjorie, who's watching him 
with a concerned gaze.

				CHASE
			(hurried)
		Marjorie, I need you to stay late.
		Geoff is really upset and I have
		to take care of this. Don't let
		him leave the house, alright?

Chase is out the door before she has a chance to respond.

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Geoff is laying on his mother's bed, weeping. Tiger sits at the 
foot of the bed. Suddenly she wakens and HISSES.

From out of the darkness...

RENEE'S HAND

ENTERS FRAME, gently touching Geoff's side. And with its arrival, 
so comes her eerie LULLABY.

				RENEE
			(a whisper)
		I need you, Geoff...

GEOFF

slowly raises his head, bewildered. Renee's hand withdraws into 
the darkness. He reaches out for her, but she's gone. The LULLABY 
remains, beckoning from down the attic stairs.

The attic door slowly swings open of its own accord.

Geoff rises from the bed and follows.

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS FOYER - NIGHT

Geoff looks into the living room as he passes. Marjorie has fallen 
asleep on the sofa with the TV on.

155   OMITTED

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

The lullaby drifts from beyond the deadfall. The fog rolls inward, 
towards the distant burial ground. As Geoff moves towards the 
deadfall, the fog converges around him.

157   OMITTED

EXT.  THE BOG - NIGHT

The lure of Renee's lullaby pulls Geoff deeper into the woods. We 
hear the unearthly ANIMAL HOWL once more.

EXT.  PLEASANTVILLE CEMETERY - NIGHT

Chase's van pulls to a stop behind a maintenance vehicle.

Chase is greeted by the limping CARETAKER, who quickly leads him 
off across the rolling hillside.

				CARETAKER
		...sorry to disturb you, Doctor
		Matthews, but I thought you'd want
		to come have a look for yourself.
		It's the damndest thing...

AT RENEE'S GRAVE -

Chase stops cold, gazing at the ground before him in disbelief...

The grave is a gaping cavity. The casket has been unearthed. 
Renee's body is missing.

				CHASE
		Jesus...
			(uncomprehending)
		Gus did this?!

				CARETAKER
			(nodding)
		He stuck around after the funeral.
		Told me he had an order to exhume
		your wife. I didn't think much of
		it until I saw him drag the body
		out of the coffin...
			(shakes his head)
		He put your wife in his truck and
		drove off right through Amanda and
		Drew's headstones...

The caretaker points across the hillside...

TIRE TRACKS cut through the manicured grass, cutting a path of 
destruction right through the field of headstones and on through 
the fence.

				CARETAKER
		I swear, nothing this weird has
		happened since Louis Creed dug up
		his boy...
			(beat)
		You want me to notify the
		authorities?

Chase doesn't answer, he just storms past the caretaker.

INT.  VAN - NIGHT

The van is speeding down the dark, open highway. Chase is on the 
car phone, frantic, waiting as it RINGS. There's finally an 
answer...

				CHASE
		Doctor Yolander, this is Chase
		Matthews, we spoke the other
		day...

Yolander cuts him off.

				YOLANDER'S VOICE
			(bitter)
		You didn't leave town, did you.

INT.  YOLANDER'S HOUSE (INTERCUT)

Yolander sits in the darkness, a bottle of whiskey and a tumbler 
at his side. His "creatures" are all around him, eyes glowing with 
reflected moonlight. His voice is slurred. The voice of someone 
who's already damned.

				YOLANDER
		You sorry bastard. You stayed. I
		have nothing more to say to you,
		Matthews...

				CHASE'S VOICE
			(desperate)
		Look, just tell me one thing. Did
		I treat an animal that had been
		brought back to life? Did I?!

				YOLANDER
		What do you think?

INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT

Chase grips the carphone tightly, his knuckles white.

				YOLANDER (V.O.)
		Believe what you saw, Matthews.
		The dog was dead.

				CHASE
		My God...
			(mounting horror)
		...how is that possible? You have
		to help me, Doctor Yolander. I
		don't know what I'm dealing with
		here! They've dug up my wife...

				YOLANDER'S VOICE
			(cutting him off)
		I'm retired from my practice,
		Matthews. It's your practice now,
		and it's your problem.
			(beat)
		God help you...

				CHASE
			(screaming)
		Wait! Don't hang up!

But Yolander does. And now we hear the DIAL TONE.

				CHASE
		Shit!

Chase flings the carphone down, looking up as...

An approaching potato truck ZOOMS by. Blinding headlights. A 
BLARING HORN. Chase barely swerves out of the way.

Recovering from the scare, Chase reaches over and opens the glove 
compartment. He pulls out his gun and sets it on the seat next to 
him.

EXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND

Geoff climbs the stone steps, reaching the flattop meas. He stops 
short, looking over the clearing...

GUS

is standing in the center of the burial ground. He's HUMMING, 
mimicking Renee's feminine tone. Now he stops and slowly turns, 
regarding Geoff with dead eyes. He's holding a pickaxe and shovel 
at his side.

Gus looks to the ground at his side. Geoff follows his gaze...

A VISION OF RENEE'S GRAVE APPEARS -

Headstone. Manicured grass. Thriving flowers. As if it had been 
uprooted from her resting place at Pleasantville and set down 
right in the middle of the Micmac ground.

And now, the vision of Renee's grave fades away. In its place is a 
bundle of white: RENEE'S SHROUDED BODY.

Gus raises the pickaxe, offering it to Geoff.

				GUS
		You bury your own, Geoff.

Geoff slowly nods and approaches, seduced beyond reason.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Marjorie stirs on the couch, blinking her eyes open at the SOUND 
of a THUD upstairs. Otherwise, the house is dark and silent.

				MARJORIE
		Geoff?

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Marjorie starts up the long, dark flight of stairs to the attic. 
The thin night-shirt she's wearing does little to protect her from 
the sudden cold. She clutches herself, shivering.

				MARJORIE
		Geoff? You okay up there?

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Marjorie cautiously pushes open the door. Her concern for Geoff is 
forgotten as she beholds the Renee Hallow memorabilia.

She moves about Renee's unpacked belongings in bewildered 
reverence.

The gauzy curtains billow about Marjorie like ghosts. And then she 
glimpses something beyond the curtains...

A FIGURE

stands in the shadows, wearing the BEADED PEACH DRESS that 
Marjorie had admired earlier. For a moment we think it's Renee, 
but as Marjorie draws closer, we see that the dress has been 
fitted onto a dressmaker's model.

Marjorie lays a hand on the fabric, feeling the contours of the 
design.

EEXT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase's headlights sweep across the front of the dark house. 
Pulling to a stop, Chase opens the van's door...

ZOWIE

LEAPS out of the darkness, sinking his teeth into Chase's 
shoulder.

Chase is thrown back over the car seat, grappling with the 
nightmare dog as it tears into him again and again...

Chase SCREAMS, reaching back for the gun. He grabs hold of it and 
swings it around... FIRES...

Zowie is BLOWN backwards, clear out of the car, spraying CHASE 
with BLOOD...

Zowie lands outside on his feet, looking stunned. His chest is a 
ruined mess. Zowie WHIMPERS and drags himself weakly towards the 
front porch.

Chase stumbles out of the van, clutching the gun. He's bleeding 
profusely.

179   OMITTED

EXT.  PORCH - NIGHT

An old saw is laying in a pile of sawdust next to a square hole 
that's been cut in the base of the front door.

Chase gives it a look as he tries the door. It's unlocked. Chase 
enters, bringing with him an illuminating swath from his 
headlights.

INT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase's headlights stream through the windows, distorting the 
interior. The house looks like it's been through a tornado. A 
trail of BLOODY PAW PRINTS leads into the kitchen. The stench is 
repulsive. Grimacing, Chase has to keep himself from gagging.

				CHASE
		Jesus...

As Chase moves forward, he catches sight of...

GUS

standing in a swath of light. At Gus' feet is Zowie, tongue 
lolling out of his mouth. Dead for the second time. Scattered 
around the dog are various tools.

Propped against the wall is the cut out square of wood. It's 
fitted with hinges at the top.

				CHASE
		Gus, what are you doing?!

Gus glances down at the dead dog.

				GUS
			(dead-pan)
		I was building a doggy door.

				CHASE
		God damn it Gus, you dug up my
		wife! What the fuck is going on
		around here?!

Gus brings a cordless electric drill up from his side, pointing it 
at Chase in a threatening manner.

				GUS
			(grins)
		A little drilling. A little
		killing.

As Gus moves forward, Chase gets a good look at him for the first 
time. He doesn't look even remotely alive.

				CHASE
		Holy shit!

Chase levels his gun with a trembling hand.

Gus stabs the air with the drill, feeding on Chase's horror.

Chase pulls the trigger. A bullet pounds Gus' chest. A SPRAY OF 
FLESH explodes from his back.

Unphased, Gus regains his balance.

				GUS
		God I hate when that happens...

Before Chase can squeeze off the next round, Gus rips the gun from 
his grip...

				GUS
		You got a permit for that?

Opening the chamber, Gus empties the remaining bullets and tosses 
the gun aside.

				GUS
		Didn't think so.

Gus fires up the drill. The bit spinZZZZZZ. He DIVES at Chase, 
knocking him back against the counter. The drill bit SINKS INTO 
CHASE'S ARM...

Chase SCREAMS as Gus withdraws it. Now, he presses it into Chase's 
shoulder. Chase is on the verge of blacking out now. The pain is 
unbearable...

Gus withdraws the drill once again, aiming now for Chase's eye.

				GUS
			(maniacal)
		No brain, no pain, Chase. Think
		about it...

The whirling drill bit is millimeters away from Chase's eye. He 
clutches Gus' arm, trying to force the drill aside...

At the last second, adrenaline kicks in and Chase diverts the 
drill. It SINKS INTO the counter-top nearby... STUCK.

Gus ROARS, lashing out, but Chase manages to duck away...

Chase catches sight of HIS GUN on the floor. He scrambles for it, 
scooping it up...

BULLETS are rolling across the floor every which way. Chase slaps 
his palm down on one and desperately fumbles with the chamber...

Gus' hands CLAMP DOWN around Chase's neck. He swings Chase around 
and SLAMS him against the wall, lifting him off his feet...

Chase GASPS as the life is literally crushed out of him...

He brings the gun up beneath Gus' chin and jams it into his ruined 
throat. Gus just keeps on throttling him...

				GUS
			(insane)
		Just remember, Chase... I had Renee
		first... and now I'm gonna have her
		last...

BLAM! The top of Gus' head BLOWS off. His BODY is thrown back by 
the incredible force, tumbling him to the kitchen floor with a 
HEAVY THUD.

Chase sucks in precious air, then his head snaps up.

				CHASE
		Geoff!

EXT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase stumbles from the house. It's a wonder he's even conscious. 
He swings open the van door and throws himself inside, sinking the 
key into the ignition.

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Marjorie is now seated before Renee's theatrical make-up mirror, 
entranced. She's wearing the beaded peach dress.

With the help of Renee's vast array of cosmetics, Marjorie has 
turned herself into a stunning beauty.

The lipstick isn't quite right. Turning to the countertop 
magnifying mirror, she carefully touches up her ruby red lips. Her 
face fills nearly the entire mirror...

...except for one rim, which reflects the dark, shadowy attic 
behind her.

A HUGE EYE joins her reflection in the distorting mirror. Marjorie 
nearly jumps out of her skin. She spins around...

				MARJORIE
		Jesus, Geoff! Don't sneak up on
		me like that!

...but no one is there.

THE MAKE-UP MIRROR catches another glimpse. Renee's RED LIPS, 
magnified tenfold. The lips begin to move...

				RENEE
			(a whisper)
		Did you really think you could be
		like me?

Renee's fist swings in, SMASHING a panel of the mirror...

Marjorie raises her hands to protect herself against the flying 
glass. And as her hands come down, she finds...

Renee standing before her. Her ghostly form silhouetted by 
moonlight. Curtains billowing around her. We never fully see her.

Marjorie's face goes white with fear.

				RENEE
		Such a young face... but you've got
		potential...

Renee grabs a fistful of Marjorie's hair, viciously YANKING her 
head back...

				RENEE
		We'll do the eyes first. You
		always start with the eyes...

Renee lashes out, SLASHING a mirror shard across the skin beneath 
Marjorie's right eye. Marjorie SCREAMS.

INT.  GEOFF'S ROOM - NIGHT

Geoff awakens at the commotion upstairs. He rocks forward, rising 
from his bed.

185   OMITTED

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Geoff pauses at the base of the attic stairway, looking up at the 
open door. All he hears are the faint SOUNDS of movement.

				GEOFF
		Marjorie? You know you're not
		supposed to be in the attic.

Geoff starts up the stairs.

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Geoff trepidatiously enters. He weaves through the maze of gauzy 
curtains. And then he sees her...

Renee is standing in the midst of the attic. She's perfectly made 
up. Gorgeous. Just as she was on the day she died. She smiles 
warmly.

				GEOFF
		Mom...

				RENEE
		I came back for you, Geoff. We're
		going to be together again.

Renee raises her outstretched arms to receive him. Through the 
haze of his tears, Geoff doesn't see the sinister, vacant gleam in 
her eyes.

INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT

Reaching the house, Chase SKIDS to a stop across the lawn.

188B  OMITTED

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Chase cautiously enters with the gun in his grasp. The spring coil 
swings the CREAKING door shut behind him.

From Chase's vantage point, he can't see them yet. He makes his 
way around the stripped dressmaker's model, past an upright 
dressing mirror. And then he sees...

MARJORIE

Slumped against Renee's bed like a ragdoll. We can only see half 
of her face. It looks untouched. Chase reaches for her...

				CHASE
		Marjorie?

Marjorie's head rolls sideways, exposing the other half of her 
face. The skin has been stripped from her skull and peeled back...

Chase turns his head away. And that's when he sees them...

RENEE AND GEOFF

Holding each other tightly. Geoff has his head buried in Renee's 
breast. Renee looks up from her son, meeting Chase's gaze. Her 
voice is both seductive and terrifying.

				RENEE
		Hello, Chase.

Chase gasps. The word "horror" doesn't do the moment justice.

				CHASE
		Oh my God...

				RENEE
		We can try again, Chase. We can
		make it work this time.

Chase sinks back against the wall. He's lost a lot of blood and 
his strength is leaving him.

				CHASE
			(shaking his head)
		No...

				RENEE
		Don't you love me anymore, Chase?

				CHASE
		You're not Renee... Renee's dead...
			(screaming)
		Geoff! Get over here now!

But Geoff just holds his mother tighter. A hint of annoyance 
flickers through Renee's eyes. She strokes Geoff's hair.

				RENEE
			(looking at Chase)
		Geoff, honey, why don't you go
		downstairs. Your father and I
		need a moment alone. Do it for
		me?

Geoff looks up at his mother, mesmerized. She releases him from 
the embrace. He brushes past Chase without a glance and heads for 
the attic door.

				RENEE
		Geoff...

Geoff pauses at the door, looking back. Renee's words have a 
hauntingly familiar ring...

				RENEE
		I love you.

Geoff smiles. Turning away, he opens the door and...

CLYDE

is standing there, an AXE perched on his shoulder. His face is 
torn to shit, bones and brain matter exposed. He's covered from 
head to toe in dirt and clotted blood. He looks worse than any of 
the undead we've seen. A total walking nightmare.

				CLYDE
			(grinning)
		Hey, Junior. Wanna play?

WHOOSH! Clyde swings the axe, sinking it into the wall just in 
front of Geoff's face...

Geoff tumbles back onto the floor, snapping out of his trance.

Clyde brings the axe down...

...and Geoff rolls to the side, barely avoiding decapitation.

				CHASE
		Geoff!

Chase stumbles forward to rescue his son. As he does so, Clyde 
brings the axe back up, SMASHING Chase in the head with the blunt 
end...

Chase goes down. Unconscious.

				CLYDE
		Oops! Looks like Daddy got a boo-
		boo...

Clyde turns his gaze back on Geoff.

				CLYDE
		Now, where were we?

Geoff shuffles backwards across the floor as Clyde moves into the 
room.

Renee passes behind Clyde. She SLAMS the attic door shut and snaps 
off the knob with a jerk of the wrist, locking them all inside.

Scared out of his wits, Geoff makes it to his feet. Clyde swings 
again and misses...

Geoff grabs hold of the axe handle, struggling, and the two boys 
go down...

RENEE

Moves to the vanity. She sweeps a hand across it, sending 
everything crashing to the ground. Crystal perfume bottles 
SHATTER, spilling their contents over the floor.

Renee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on. She touches the 
flame to the perfume-soaked floor...

FLAMES roar into existence, racing across the floorboards, 
igniting the curtains...

We see the flames reflected in Renee's soulless eyes.

ON GEOFF AND CLYDE

As they wrestle with one another across the floor. Bloody spittle 
drips from Clyde's face. He flashes a feral snarl.

Clyde LUNGES forward and tears into Geoff's shoulder with his 
teeth...

Geoff SCREAMS. His hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a 
mirror shard. He JABS it up and into Clyde's eye...

Somehow, Geoff manages to roll out from under Clyde. He rises to 
his feet...

Clyde lets loose a DEMONIC ROAR. He charges, SLASHING the axe 
wildly, knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike. 
Nothing's going to stop him. Nothing.

Flames are consuming the attic, licking the rafters, igniting the 
canopy drapings... devouring everything. SMOKE is rolling across 
the floor...

Geoff reaches a far wall. He's trapped in a corner. There's 
nowhere else to go. Behind Geoff is a CIRCUIT BOX. INSULATED 
CABLES run from the box down through the attic floor. Geoff 
turns...

And here comes Clyde...

				CLYDE
		Here it comes, buddy! HERE IT
		FUCKING COMES!!!

Clyde swings. Geoff ducks. The axe hits the circuit box behind 
him, severing the insulated cables...

As Clyde rips the axe out of the wall for another try, Geoff 
reaches for one of the SPARKING CABLES.

Clyde raises the axe above his head...

				CLYDE
		Eat it, ass-hole...

				GEOFF
		EAT THIS!!!

...and Geoff shoves the live cable into Clyde's mouth!

SPARKS shoot out of Clyde's eyes and ears. He jerks back and 
forth, writhing in a horrific replay of Renee's electrocution.

Then Clyde's face BLOWS APART in a gout of ruined flesh and BLUE 
FLAME. The circuit is blown and the SMOKING BODY falls...

Geoff drops the cable. The blazing inferno is closing in. He runs 
to Chase...

Chase is barely conscious. Geoff drops to his knees and pulls his 
father to his feet...

				RENEE (O.S.)
		Don't leave me again, Geoff!

Geoff turns...

RENEE

is standing in the midst of the FLAMES, reaching out. The make-up 
and mortician's wax she wears fall victim to the heat and her 
"face" begins to MELT AWAY...

				RENEE
		Don't leave me alone!

Geoff turns away, horrified. With Chase on his shoulder, he 
reaches the door. Locked. Geoff sets Chase against the wall.

He spots the AXE, still clutched in Clyde's hand. Geoff drags the 
axe free from the dead boy's grasp and goes to work on the door...

Ignoring Renee's CRIES, Geoff swings the axe again and again, 
chopping the door apart. He coughs through the smoke. The flames 
are almost upon them...

Finally, the wood splinters apart. Geoff reaches through and 
grasps the outside handle, pulling the door open. Then he turns 
and lifts Chase up once more...

At the door, Geoff pauses for one final, tearful look back. Then 
his face hardens and he turns away, pulling Chase to safety.

				RENEE
		NO, GEOFF! NO!!!

ON RENEE

Alone in the fiery storm, SCREAMING. Flames devour her flowing 
white dress. Her face doesn't even look remotely human anymore.

And as the inferno slowly closes in, we...

								DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  VETERINARY OFFICE - DAY

We PULL OUT from a sign on the door that says "CLOSED".

Chase is just now locking up the door. He's bandaged up, looking a 
little worse for the wear, but happy to be alive. He turns, 
grinning...

GEOFF

stands near the van, holding Tiger in his arms.

				GEOFF
		All set?

				CHASE
		All set.

Chase joins Geoff at the van and together they climb inside. Chase 
starts the engine, pulling away from the office.

WE STAY ON THE VAN -

As it moves off down the street, passing the familiar landmarks of 
sleepy Ludlow.

RISING UP -

We follow the van as it sweeps out of town. Ludlow looks picture-
perfect from our bird's eye vantage point. Charming and quiet.

				CHASE (V.O.)
		So where're we going?

				GEOFF
		Anywhere but here.

We continue rising up into the brilliant blue sky, losing the van 
amidst the rolling Maine countryside and we

								DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  MICMAC FOREST - DAY

RUSHING over the woods, just above the tree tops. It's an ocean of 
swaying green beneath us. A forest as ancient and mysterious as 
anything on the Earth.

AND SUDDENLY -

The endless trees fall out from under us. We find ourselves above 
the flattop mesa of the Micmac burial ground, swooping downward...

The ground surges towards us. We see Renee's OPEN GRAVE.

The quality of light is different now. We hear the wail of the 
LONESOME WIND, and perhaps, the WHISPER of something altogether 
alien.

And on the unsettling note, we...

"PET SEMATARY II"


FADE IN:

INT.  LEMARCHE CASTLE, TOMB - NIGHT (1865)

A storm is raging outside. We hear the clap and roll of THUNDER.

TOMB STAIRWAY -

RATS scurry away down the scum-covered steps as the GLOW OF A 
LANTERN and FOOTSTEPS herald someone's arrival...

GENVIEVE LEMARCHE

emerges around the bend. Mid-30s. Cultured beauty. Her dress and 
face are smeared with grime and... is that blood we see too? God 
only knows what's happened to her.

Genvieve ducks under a monstrous cobweb as she passes an open 
window.

WINDOW

LIGHTNING streaks across the night sky outside. We catch a glimpse 
of the MOON disappearing behind the clouds.

Genvieve reaches the bottom of the stairs. The tomb itself.

Water trickles in through cracks in the lichen-covered walls, 
pooling on the tomb floor.

Genvieve moves forward, her lantern throwing distorted shadows 
over everything...

In front of her is Anton LeMarche's stone sarcophagus.
Genvieve kneels in the water, one hand resting on the spiked iron 
railing which surrounds the tomb. She reaches the other hand 
towards a scum-covered plaque, brushing the grime away...

THUNDER and LIGHTNING reach a crescendo as...

A SKELETAL HAND rises out of the water, reaching for her.

Genvieve SCREAMS. The lantern falls from her grasp, sputtering 
out. The hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her 
breast instead...

Genvieve starts to laugh hysterically.

				DIRECTOR (O.S.)
			(exasperated)
		Cut! Thank you, Renee. Can we
		throw some light on the set?

				GENVIEVE
		I'm sorry...

Suddenly it is lighter. Genvieve can't stop laughing. The groping 
monster hand disappears back beneath the water.

WE PULL BACK, REVEALING -

It's not 1865. The LeMarche Castle tomb is in fact, a 90s movie 
set. We are inside a soundstage, on a raised set, so the slugline 
should really read...

INT.  SOUNDSTAGE, LEMARCHE CASTLE TOMB SET -

A FILM CREW scurries about. Everyone is LAUGHING now. The DIRECTOR 
sits to the right. He and the DP are already huddled over the 
video-assist monitor. We see the previous scene rewinding at high-
speed.

The FIRST A.D. moves in.

				FIRST A.D.
		Water in the pool's running low,
		fill her up!

Crewmembers move towards the set.

An SFX PUPPETEER (i.e., the skeletal arm) crawls out from under, 
followed by an ELECTRICIAN.

				PUPPETEER
		I can't see shit down there! I'm
		working blind!

GENVIEVE/THE ACTRESS

rises out of the water. Her name is actually RENEE HALLOW and her 
beauty is undeniable, even in such a disheveled state.

				RENEE
		This is great, I could've spent
		four months on a romantic comedy
		with Warren Beatty, and instead,
		I've got a horny zombie trying to
		cop a feel!

The crew members LAUGH. She's well-liked on the set. Renee grins. 
Wardrobe and make-up personnel move in to adjust Renee's 
appearance.

				RENEE
		Uhgh, there's water everywhere...
			(beat)
		Can I get a cigarette?

The MAKE-UP GIRL pulls a pack of cigarettes from her fanny-pack 
and offers Renee one. In a flash, a P.A. appears with a lighter. 
Renee mumbles "thanks" as she fires up. She squints her eyes, 
trying to see past the set lights.

				RENEE
			(calling out)
		Geoff?
			(beat)
		Anybody see my boy?

				GEOFF (O.S.)
		Right here, Mom...

GEOFF MATTHEWS, Renee's 12 year-old son steps into view. Renee's 
face lights up when she sees him.

				RENEE
		How long have you been here?

				GEOFF
		Couple minutes. I saw the last
		shot. That was pretty cool.

Renee grimaces as the make-up girl spritzes her face with a spray-
bottle.

				RENEE
			(casually)
		How did it go with your father
		last night?

				GEOFF
		Good. He said he'd be over for
		dinner at eight...
			(awkward)
		I mean... he misses you, Mom...

				RENEE
		I miss him too...

				RENEE
			(continuing)
		I just don't want you to get your
		hopes up, okay? We're trying to
		work things out, but...

Her voice trails off.

				GEOFF
		I know, Mom.

				RENEE
			(affectionate)
		You know everything, don't you?

Renee and Geoff are interrupted by a CREWMEMBER who's spraying 
"atmosphere" about the set with a hand-held smoke machine. Renee 
coughs.

Off-set, the FIRST A.D. is trying to get the show on the road.

				FIRST A.D.
		Okay, people! Quiet! We're going
		to try this another time!

				GEOFF
		Guess it's showtime.

				RENEE
		Yep.

Renee kisses Geoff on the forehead. He takes the cigarette from 
her and moves off the set, standing near the camera.

The director turns back toward Renee.

				DIRECTOR
		Alright, Renee. Last time. I
		promise. We nail this and you
		won't have to do this ever again.

				RENEE
		That's what you said the first
		time...

Renee turns and heads back toward the stairs. A P.A. hands her a 
new lantern. As she reaches the stairs, the house lights dim, 
creating the proper atmosphere once again.

UNDER THE SET -

The puppeteer gets ready. It's cramped. The electrician checks a 
power box connection.

The director nods to the camera operator.

				OPERATOR
		Rolling. Speed...

				SLATE BOY
		"Castle of Terror." Scene 69A.
		Take thirteen.

The slate comes down.

				DIRECTOR
		Action!

The scene replays itself as before, only now we're watching the 
action from multiple viewpoints.

We start on the video assist monitor, then move up to...

GEOFF

He grins as he watches the scene unfold.

ON THE SET

Renee has reached the sarcophagus. LIGHTNING flashes. The skeleton 
hand bursts up, grabbing Renee's arm. The scene continues past the 
original point of interruption.

UNDER THE SET -

We see an undetected LEAK. Water drips down. The puppeteer shifts 
position, struggling, and...

...knocks over the power box which SPARKS just as...

ABOVE -

Renee/Genvieve grabs the iron railing with both hands.

Electricity surges through Renee. Her body jerks and writhes like 
some nightmarish marionette.

UNDER THE SET -

The electrician drags the puppeteer back. Sparks fly.

				ELECTRICIAN
		Jesus! We've crossed over into
		220! Shut down the generator!

ABOVE -

Crewmembers SCREAM and scramble back...

All the circuits are blowing, lights EXPLODING and showering 
sparks over the whole set. This is not part of the movie.

RENEE

It's awful. She shakes, her SMOKING HANDS frozen to the iron 
railing by the electricity running through her...

Suddenly, Renee falls forward against the iron. Her face begins to 
SMOKE AND SINGE...

The lights CONTINUE TO BLOW, casting a strobic effect over the 
soundstage, adding to the chaos.

ON GEOFF

As he witnesses the whole event. He tries to rush forward, but 
someone restrains him...

				GEOFF
		Mom!!!!

Suddenly all the circuits in the stage are blown and the LIGHTS GO 
OUT. Renee slumps back into the water, smoke trailing up from her 
still form. And we...

OMITTED (SCENES 2 THRU 2J)

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY

An aged GOLDEN RETRIEVER is on the surgical table. CHASE MATTHEWS, 
D.V.M., gently strokes the dog's fur. He's good with the dog. He's 
kind. The retriever's owners: a MOTHER and her SON, look on.

				CHASE
		I think this is probably for the
		best. He's a very old dog. He
		has arthritis. He has cataracts
		in his eyes...

Chase looks at the mother. He's always hated this part.

				CHASE
		He's had a good life...
			(to dog)
		...haven't you, boy?

				INTERCOM
		Doctor Matthews, your son is on
		line one. He says it's an
		emergency...

Chase breaks concentration, pulling his eyes away from the mother 
and son.

INT.  SOUNDSTAGE, LEMARCHE CASTLE TOMB SET -

A blur of activity converges on the movie set. A TRIO OF 
PARAMEDICS. A FIRE OFFICIAL. A POLICE OFFICER. Medical equipment. 
Horrified crewmembers watch on, helpless.

WE STAY ON Geoff, momentarily blocked out and then revealed again 
and again, amidst the commotion of paramedics scrambling to save 
Renee. The director has his hand on Geoff's shoulder.

Geoff's eyes dart about, taking it all in. Things are happening 
very fast:

--Renee's hand is lifted. Someone checking her pulse. --Her 
eyelids parted. A pen light flashing at her fixed pupils.

				PARAMEDIC #1 (O.S.)
		Run me down a line of normal
		saline.

--An I.V. needle plunges into the inside of Renee's elbow. --A 
syringe injects into the I.V. post.

--Hands hook up a life-pack monitor. Renee's dress is torn away. 
Electrodes press to bare skin. --The monitor screen blinks to 
life.

				PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
		We have a bradycardic rhythm at
		30.

--Another PARAMEDIC dials out on a cellular phone, to the 
consulting physician.

				PARAMEDIC #3 (O.S.)
		White female. Approximately
		thirty five years old.
		Electrocution...

--A clear tube is inserted down her throat. --The monitor shows 
erratic heartbeat.

				PARAMEDIC #2 (O.S.)
		She's in V-fib.

--There's a renewed urgency even amidst their rush.

--Defibrillator paddles are pressed to her chest.

Geoff looks to the monitor as...

--It goes to flatline.

				PARAMEDIC (O.S.)
		Clear.

				GEOFF
		No...

Geoff moves forward, pulling away from the director. The police 
officer moves in and intercepts Geoff, turning the boy away.

Geoff's eyes fix on the monitor. An unbending flatline...

				GEOFF
		You have to bring her back...

Chase rushes onto the set, pushing past crewmembers. He freezes at 
the sight of the horrific commotion around Renee's still form.

				CHASE
		Oh Jesus...

Chase's gaze connects with his son.

				GEOFF
			(helpless)
		Dad...

We pull back from Geoff, Chase, and the commotion around Renee. 
Farther and farther as the darkness around the set begins to close 
in...

				PARAMEDIC #1 (O.S.)
			(urgent)
		We're losing her...

Darkness everywhere and we

EXT.  A DREAMLIKE FOG

A form drifts forward, materializing out of the fog.

It's a CASKET. Appearing as if it's floating among the clouds. 
PULLING BACK, WE SEE that it's moving along A CONVEYOR. AND NOW, 
WE CAN make out the faint form of A PLANE as the conveyor descends 
from the cargo compartment.

The casket reaches the end of the conveyor. A tag marks its final 
destination: Bangor, Maine. HANDS reach in and lift the casket. 
FOUR BAGGAGE HANDLERS hoist the casket up onto their shoulders and 
carry it off.

				HANDLER #1
		Is it true she grew up around
		here?

				HANDLER #2
		Yeah. Over in Ludlow.

				HANDLER #1
		Huh. Never met a movie star
		before.

				HANDLER #3
		Well you're a little late for an
		autograph.

The baggage handlers laugh as they walk off into the distance. The 
fog closes around them and we...

								DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  PLEASANTVILLE CEMETERY - DAY

We drift down from the gray sky to the somber scene below. Off in 
the distance, a crowd of MOURNERS are gathered around a grave.

				PRIEST (V.O.)
		...I am the resurrection and the
		life, saith the Lord...

CLOSER -

THE HEADSTONE is adorned with an iron plaque. It reads, simply:

			RENEE HALLOW MATTHEWS
				1955-1991

				PRIEST (V.O.)
		...She that believeth in me,
		though she were dead, yet shall
		she live; and whosoever liveth and
		believeth in me, shall never
		die...

THE CASKET is slowly lowered into the open grave. As it descends, 
WE SEE Geoff and his father, Chase, standing at the forefront of 
the crowd. Renee's grave is next to those of her parents.

Among the mourners is MARJORIE HARGROVE, an attractive local girl 
in her early twenties.

Further down the hillside, a wall of NEWS REPORTERS are gathered 
behind a roped-off media boundary. There is a blinding flurry of 
PHOTO FLASHES as the press records the scene before them.

A SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PATROL CAR cruises up the cemetery drive, 
pulling to a stop near the mob of reporters.

Out of the car steps GUS GILBERT. Gus is nearly forty, with a 
Sheriff's uniform fitted to his solid, ageless frame. Gruff, maybe 
a little self-important: Gus likes being a big fish in a small 
pond.

				GUS
			(drawing near)
		Let's keep it back, folks.
		Try to show her a little
		respect...

A REPORTER ducks under the media boundary, moving in for a closer 
shot.

He doesn't make it two steps before he's intercepted by Gus. Gus 
grabs the reporter and shoves him back.

				GUS
		Hey! What did I just say?

Gus means business. One look into his eyes reveals his intense, no 
nonsense approach.

				REPORTER
		Ass-hole...

The reporter backs off.

BACK AT THE GRAVESIDE -

Beneath the gloomy, ominous skies, the lines on Chase's face shade 
him as a decade older than his thirty-five years. Chase gently 
places a comforting hand on Geoff's shoulder.

Geoff inches forward, pulling free of Chase's touch. Drawn to his 
mother, drawn from his father. The only blemishes on his youthful, 
rosy cheeks are the tears, the endless tears.

				PRIEST (V.O.)
		I know that my redeemer liveth,
		and that he shall stand at the
		latter day upon the earth.

Geoff looks upon the casket, gazing into the abyss of despair.

FOLLOWING THE CEREMONY

The crowd has dispersed.

Geoff is standing at the base of Renee's grave. His eyes fixed. 
Unmoving. Unaccepting.

Chase is nearby, watching, not wanting to intrude on Geoff's 
private moment.

Gus quietly moves in at Chase's side.

				GUS
		Did she always have reporters
		following her around like this?

				CHASE
		Pretty much so.

Gus glances at Geoff.

				GUS
		I hear you moved into town.

				CHASE
		I wanted to get Geoff out of
		L.A. Just start things over, you
		know?

Gus nods. Now his eyes fall on Renee's headstone.

				GUS
		I remember when Renee left. She
		couldn't wait to get out of
		Ludlow. She used to say that
		life moved too slow here...

Chase forces a smile.

				CHASE
		That's Renee alright.

				GUS
		I suppose so.

The sky above seems heavy with imminent rain and we...

EXT.  HOUSE - DAY

Lazy oaks embrace a vintage, two-story Victorian home in the rural 
neighborhood of Ludlow, Maine. A commercial MOVING VAN is parked 
out front.

Marjorie, the girl we saw at Renee's funeral, is coming down the 
sidewalk. She checks the address on the front of the house, then 
heads up the driveway.

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

Moving boxes clutter the downstairs.

Chase is weaving through the maze, doing an inventory on the 
boxes.

A sweaty PAIR OF MOVERS are climbing up the stairs. Each is 
hunched  over, with a garment box balanced on his back. The side 
of each carton is boldly labeled: RENEE - ATTIC.

				MOVER (O.S.)
		We've got six more of these. You
		sure you want them all in the
		attic?

Chase is contemplating a compromise when Geoff appears from the 
kitchen doorway.

				CHASE
		...Geoff, what if we just give
		the clothes to Goodwill? We'll
		keep the rest. Just the clothes.

Geoff shakes his head, firm and deliberate denial.

				GEOFF
		You're the one who wanted to move.
		Nobody would've touched them if
		you didn't want to move here...

Chase weakens, giving in.

				CHASE
		All the 'Renee' boxes go in the
		attic. Sorry.

Marjorie KNOCKS on the open frame of the front door.

Geoff recognizes her from his mother's funeral. She flashes him a 
warm smile.

				MARJORIE
		Hi. I'm Marjorie Hargrove. Your
		new housekeeper.

Marjorie has a naive, friendly quality about her. She's also 
blessed with eye-popping genetics. Standing there outside the 
door, looking more than a little nervous... we can't help but like 
her. Needless to say, she doesn't look like your typical 
housekeeper.

				MARJORIE
			(re: Chase's reaction)
		Is something wrong?

				CHASE
		Uh... no. You just... look
		different than you sounded on the
		phone. Please, come in.

Marjorie enters. She grins at Geoff again. Yep. She's nervous 
alright.

				MARJORIE
		I'm real excited about working
		for you Mr. Matthews...

				CHASE
		Well we're glad to have you,
		Marjorie. You can call me Chase,
		by the way.

Marjorie passes her curious eyes over one of Renee's garment 
containers.

				MARJORIE
		I've always admired Ms. Hallow.
		That scene she did in Blue
		Midnight, where her lover meets
		her at the train station...
			(she sighs)
		I must've watched that movie four
		times.

Chase smiles. Marjorie's enthusiasm is endearing.

Just then, one of the movers loses his grip. A garment box bounces 
down the slope of the stairs. When it reaches the bottom, dresses 
spill over the floor.

				MARJORIE
		Oh. I'll get that...

Marjorie moves for the spill. The first dress she touches is a 
beaded peach evening gown. Her fingers linger on the fabric.

				MARJORIE
		This is gorgeous. She wore this
		at the Emmys, didn't she?

Geoff moves forward, acting overly defensive.

				GEOFF
		Hey, don't touch her stuff. It
		made her crazy when people touched
		her stuff.

Marjorie is taken aback by the oddity of Geoff's statement.

Chase catches her eye, shrugging apologetically.

EXT.  DRIVEWAY - DAY

A VAN is parked outside. The rear side panel is masked off with 
tape and a stencil. Chase grabs the corner of the tape and 
carefully peels it back, revealing a crisp, new business logo:

		ROUND THE CLOCK ANIMAL DOC
		MOBILE VETERINARY SERVICE
		CHASE MATTHEWS, D.V.M.
		Serving Aroostook County

EXT.  TOWN - DAY

ESTABLISHING. Shops and businesses situated around a lazy town 
square. QUiet. Relaxed. As rural as they come.

WE pick up Chase's van as it cruises by.

EXT.  VETERINARY OFFICE - DAY

Chase pulls the van in front of an unassuming veterinary office.

On the door is Chase's nameplate. And on the weathered wall is an 
outline of letters where the name and title "Quentin Yolander, 
Doctor of Veterinary Medicine" once was.

Geoff is first out of the van.

INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Geoff and Chase move inside. The offices look like they were built 
in the 40s. A dark corridor stretches down the center of the 
suite. Faded green walls are solid, with few exteriors. It's 
creepy in here.

Heavy, grey plastic curtains absorb much of the light which does 
find its way in. Nothing looks like it's been updated in the past 
fifty years.

				CHASE
		This doesn't look so bad...

Chase sweeps a curtain aside, revealing the interior to Geoff. 
Dust swirls in the air.

				GEOFF
		How long ago did this guy retire?

				CHASE
		It's been a few years.

Geoff takes a look around, growing uncomfortable.

				GEOFF
			(skeptical)
		A few?

Geoff moves on down the central corridor which seems to grow 
darker and more dismal with every step. He moves on into the 
boarding room...

INT.  BOARDING AREA - DAY

Rows of kennels are stacked along the walls, smothered with 
cobwebs. Ancient, rusted surgical equipment is scattered 
everywhere. The place is a mess. Windows are boarded up and 
shadows cloak the room.

Over to the right, Geoff hears a RUSTLING.

A CARDBOARD BOX on one of the shelves jiggles. Something is moving 
around inside it.

Geoff's eyes widen. Still, morbid curiosity propels him forward.

The box rustles again. He reaches for it and...

A CREATURE LEAPS out at him, HOWLING. Geoff SCREAMS and jumps 
back. The box tumbles over and...

A CAT crawls out. Behind the protective mother, are four of the 
cutest kittens we've ever seen, MEWING away.

Geoff sighs just as Chase rushes into the room.

				CHASE
		What's wrong?!

				GEOFF
			(embarrassed)
		Nothing. I just got spooked by a
		bunch of furballs.

Inside the box is a note. Chase reaches for it. It reads: "And a 
warm welcome to you."

				CHASE
		Great, now I've opened an
		orphanage too.

One of the kittens pads out of the box and looks up at Geoff with 
sleepy eyes. Her fur is striped.

				GEOFF
		Well, I'll take one. If it's
		okay...

Geoff lifts the fragile creature, cradling it in his arms.

				GEOFF
		She looks like a tiger.

Chase spies an old broom resting in the corner.

				CHASE
		Tell you what, you do some
		sweeping up here, and she's yours.

Geoff nods and Chase moves back out into the hallway.

Geoff sets the box back upright and lowers Tiger in with the other 
kittens. He reaches for the broom and goes to work sweeping away 
the cobwebs.

Just as soon as he turns his back, Tiger climbs the side of the 
box, spilling over onto the floor.

INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM

Chase is unpacking a shipment of medical supplies. When he places 
them in the cabinet, he stirs up a layer of dust.

Tiger scampers by as Chase coughs his way out of the cloud of 
dust.

INT.  WAITING AREA

Tiger sees the front door ajar. And as she approaches to explore 
what lies beyond--

The door swings open...

ZOWIE, A SIBERIAN HUSKY is staring back at her. He's black and 
white with blue eyes, with a mask that is at once menacing and 
majestic.

A pudgy thirteen year old boy, DREW, has a hold of the dog's 
collar.

Zowie's BARK sends Tiger scrambling.

Drew loses his grip as Zowie yanks free. A strong, paternal 
command calls after Drew from outside.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Drew, you get a handle on that
		dog, now!

INT.  EXAMINATION ROOM

Chase spins around at the commotion as Tiger darts across the 
floor with the barking dog in pursuit.

Mayhem ensues as Zowie's big paws slip on the slick tile.

Geoff rushes in from the boarding area.

Tiger ducks beneath the back of a surgical gurney.

Zowie's snoot wedges beneath the base, inches from Tiger's tiny, 
striking paw.

Drew slides in on his knees, renewing his hold on Zowie's collar. 
He pulls the dog back.

Geoff rescues Tiger from beneath the gurney.

Drew shrugs sheepishly.

				DREW
		Sorry. He gets kinda hyper...

Drew's stepfather, Gus Gilbert, enters. The dreaded, domineering 
voice of authority in Drew's life. WE know him as the sheriff at 
Renee's funeral.

				GUS
		Hell, he thought it was lunch.
		How ya doin', Chase?
			(a handshake)
		You haven't met my boy.
			(aside)
		Drew, where the hell are your
		manners.

Drew steps forward and awkwardly offers his hand to Chase. Then 
Geoff. The boys shake.

				GEOFF
		He's a cool lookin' dog.

Zowie lurches forward, eager to shower affection on Geoff. Geoff 
strokes the dog's soft mane.

				GEOFF
		What's his name?

				DREW
		Zowie.

Drew puts his palm under Zowie's chin and turns him for Chase to 
see. There are several scabbed-over gashes on his left cheek.

				GUS
		Damn dog stuck his nose in on my
		rabbits and they ganged up on him.
		I swear that dog's an idiot.

				DREW
		Is he gonna be okay?

With one eye on Zowie, Chase sprays some antiseptic on the 
examination table and wipes it clean.

				CHASE
		Let's have him hop up here.

Drew prods Zowie. Zowie jumps up onto the table. Chase looks over 
the facial lacerations, then turns on a penlight and examines the 
dog's eyes.

Gus passes a lingering look over Tiger. He reaches in to pet her, 
making sure it meets with Geoff's approval.

				GUS
		When I was young I thought cats
		were the girls and dogs were the
		boys.

				CHASE
		There are three more girls where
		that one came from looking for
		homes.

Drew perks up at the thought, but Gus shoots it down.

				GUS
		Not our home.

Chase takes the light out of Zowie's eyes. He looks to Gus.

				CHASE
		Thee facial lacerations should heal
		up pretty quickly. I'll give you
		som antibiotic cream--

				GUS
		--Drew, he's your dog. Are you
		listening to this?

Chase turns to Drew and continues...

				CHASE
		His left eye is scratched, corneal
		abrasion. Eyedrops will help, but
		it's going to take som time. Try
		to keep him away from those
		rabbits, huh?

Drew nods, casting a glance aside at Gus.

				GUS
			(to Chase)
		I hear you've got Marjorie
		Hargrove working for you now.

				CHASE
		How'd you know that?

Gus gives Chase a knowing grin.

				GUS
		It's a small town, Chase.

Gus laughs and claps Chase on the shoulder.

				GUS
		Hey Geoff, did you know your
		mother and I used to be high-
		school sweethearts?

Geoff is surprised at this. Surprised and annoyed. Tact isn't a 
quality that Gus possesses in abundance.

				GEOFF
		Really?

				GUS
			(nodding)
		Homecoming. Prom. Whole nine
		yards.
			(to Chase)
		Course that was a lifetime ago.

EXT.  SCHOOL - DAY

JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL KIDS are converging en masse for classes. 
Chase's van pulls up front.

INT.  VAN - DAY

Chase digs some cash out of his wallet. Geoff stares out at the 
school. He's dreading this.

				CHASE
		What's a lunch cost these days?
		You want ten?

				GEOFF
			(unenthused)
		Sure.

Chase looks at his son.

				CHASE
		You nervous? New town, new
		school. I know it must be pretty
		hard for you...

				GEOFF
			(cutting him off)
		I'll be fine, Dad.

Geoff reaches for the door, but Chase stops him. He's trying to 
reach his son. He really is.

				CHASE
			(awkward)
		Geoff... you have to help me out
		here a little...

"MEOW!" Chase drops his eyes to the bulge squirming around in 
Geoff's jacket. He can't help but smile.

				CHASE
		Are you sure you don't want me to
		pick you up. It's a long ride.

Geoff opens the side panel of the van and slips out his MOUNTAIN 
BIKE.

				GEOFF
		That's what my bike's for...

Before Chase can say another word, Geoff is gone.

EXT.  VAN - DAY

As Chase pulls away, WE SEE the handmade sign taped in the back 
window:

				PRICELESS KITTENS
				FREE TO A GOOD HOME

EXT.  SCHOOL - DAY

Drew is among a small circle of BOYS. He recognizes Geoff walking 
his bike from the van. The largest of the boys, CLYDE, takes 
notice of the unfamiliar face.

Clyde is fifteen, going on twenty. You know the type: local bully, 
held back a year or two.

				CLYDE
		Check it out. That's the new kid.
		The son of that movie star.

Mischief gleams in Clyde's eyes as he watches Geoff's every move. 
The other boys follow suit. Clyde always takes the lead.

Geoff fields their penetrating stares. For a second his eyes 
connect with Clyde's, then he moves on into the building.

Among the boys, Drew is the reluctant participant.

INT.  CLASSROOM - DAY

MRS. GORDON is addressing a room of SEVENTH GRADERS.

Geoff is doodling in his notebook, feeling acutely out of place as 
he tries to avoid the curious glances the rest of his new 
classmates are giving him.

				MRS. GORDON
		People, this is Geoff Matthews.
		He'll be joining our class for the
		rest of the school year...

As Mrs. Gordon points to him, Geoff drops his face even lower. 
This is the worst embarrassment a boy could ever suffer. He'd like 
to throttle Mrs. Gordon.

A freckle-faced boy, DOUG, fires off a question.

				DOUG
		Hey, what's Hollywood like? Do
		you know Eddie Murphy?

				GEOFF
			(annoyed)
		No.

				MRS. GORDON
		Why don't we save that for later,
		Doug?

A girl with braces, SUSAN, continues the interrogation.

				SUSAN
		What about Julia Roberts?

				MRS. GORDON
		Susan! That'll be enough.

Susan shuts up. Geoff sinks even lower in his seat.

The kids turn their eyes back to the front of the room.

But one classmate's eyes are still on Geoff. It's Clyde.

Clyde shifts his stare to the squirming lump in Geoff's jacket. He
catches a glimpse of Tiger's bobbing nose popping out.

INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

Geoff joins the stampede of kids as the BELL releases them for the 
day. Almost immediately, Clyde and his cronies, STEVIE AND BRAD, 
fall in step behind him. Drew hangs slightly off to the side, not 
really wanting to be a part of the intimidation.

				CLYDE
		What's the hurry, Junior? Where
		you off to?

Clyde quickens his pace, pulling ahead of Geoff and stopping in 
front of him. Stevie and Brad move in on either side. Surrounded 
by peers, it's apparent how small Geoff is for his age.

On the wall next to them is a bulletin board display. Clyde 
glances at it. Geoff follows his gaze.

DISPLAY

It's one of those corny school affairs with construction paper 
letters spelling out: "WE REMEMBER RENEE HALLOW." Beneath that are 
pictures of Renee clipped from various magazines. Cloyingly 
tasteless.

				CLYDE
			(feigning remorse)
		Too bad about your Mom. Papers
		said it was pretty gross, getting
		fried like that. Guess you saw
		it, huh?

Geoff nods. Clyde raises his eyebrows, pulling Geoff's jacket 
open.

				CLYDE
		So, what are you hiding there?

				STEVIE
		When you bring a friend to school
		you're supposed to introduce him.

Geoff's arm tightens protectively around Tiger.

				GEOFF
		Her name's Tiger.

				CLYDE
		Tiger? Don't you think that's
		kind of a pussy name?
			(reaching out)
		Can I hold her? I promise I'll be
		real careful.

Clyde has a convincing way about him. Geoff reluctantly hands the 
kitten over. Clyde is so gentle with the creature that one would 
never question his sincerity.

Geoff is just beginning to feel at ease when something changes in 
Clyde's tone, something sinister.

				CLYDE
		Hey, Geoff. You ever seen a
		kitten run?

				GEOFF
		I've seen her run around the
		house.

Clyde's eyes narrow. He takes a couple of steps back. Geoff's 
heart starts to sink.

				CLYDE
		No, I mean really run...
			(beat)
		Like this!

Clyde backsteps and bolts off down the hallway with Tiger. Brad 
and Stevie fall in behind him, laughing.

Drew shrugs apologetically. He's torn, but he tears off after them 
nonetheless.

				GEOFF
		Shit...

Geoff runs off in pursuit of them.

EXT.  SCHOOL - DAY

Geoff rushes from the building, searching the dispersing crowd. 
There they are, tearing from the bike racks, pedaling for the 
street.

Clyde sees Geoff and mockingly holds the kitten out for display as 
they ride by.

Geoff runs for the bike racks.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Clyde and his cohorts break from the outskirts of town, riding out 
onto the open road.

Clyde glances back toward the center of town.

Geoff is so far behind he's barely visible.

Clyde returns his eyes to the road ahead, raising Tiger nose to 
nose with him.

				CLYDE
		Having fun yet?

Clyde and his smirking buddies ride on, OUT OF FRAME.

WITH GEOFF

giving the pedals all he can, struggling to keep pace with the 
boys.

35    OMITTED

FURTHER ALONG

Scattered houses sprinkle the landscape ahead. Cochran Lake 
stretches into the distance beyond the housing.

Clyde's clan cuts from the road and blazes a trail across a 
residential property. The two-story house is weathered and boarded 
up. It looks vaguely familiar. Creepy.

And when WE FIND the mailbox post, we know why. The name is faded, 
but there's no question who once lived there. Five bold letters: 
"CREED."

Geoff whips by in a blur, still in pursuit.

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Clyde and his friends have abandoned their bikes. They've taken 
position on top of the slope of the hill, standing at the foot of 
THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY.

38    OMITTED

EXT.  PET SEMATARY PATH - DAY

Geoff pulls his bike to a stop short of the boys. He dismounts and 
leans it up against a tree.

				GEOFF
		Just give me the cat, all right?

A devilish grin creeps over Clyde. He strolls down the path toward 
Geoff. Clyde grabs Geoff's handlebars and, backing up, pulls Geoff 
and the bike with him.

				CLYDE
		I would but... there was a little
		accident...
			(feeding off Geoff's
			alarm)
		She was trying to get away. You
		know, running down my leg... and
		her head got too close to the 
		spokes. Pretty gross. What's
		left of her is up in the Pet
		Sematary. A zip-lock bag might
		help...
			(shrugs)
		...but I happen to be out of them
		at the moment.

Drew shakes his head, disgusted he has to put up with Clyde's 
antics.

				DREW
		Come on, Clyde, just tell him
		where the cat is...

				CLYDE
			(turning on Drew)
		...I TOLD HIM where the cat is!
		Now shut up, fuck-face!

Clyde punches Drew in the arm. Drew shrinks back.

Geoff flashes a hateful stare at Clyde.

All of the boys but Clyde are uncomfortably silent. There's 
something frightening about Clyde... something that extends beyond 
the standard bully antics. We begin to get the feeling that this 
kid is genuinely deranged.

				CLYDE
			(relishing the
			moment)
		You heard about the Creed murders
		yet? And the place where the dead
		come back to life?

He motions to the path behind him.

				CLYDE
			(continuing)
		It's just back there. Just down
		that path...

				DREW
			(meekly)
		Clyde... it's not funny anymore.

				CLYDE
		Oh? So you got a problem?
		What're you gonna do, fat-ass? You
		gonna sic big, bad, old Gus after
		me?

Drew shuts up. Clyde turns back to Geoff, drawing closer.

				CLYDE
		What do you think, Geoff? Maybe
		you could dig up your Mom and take
		her back there. Maybe if you pray
		real hard, she'll come back.

With this last remark Clyde has pushed too far. Geoff's face is 
red with anger.

				GEOFF
			(quietly)
		Just give me the cat, ass-hole.

Clyde's grin falters a moment.

				CLYDE
		Excuse me, maybe I'm a little hard
		of hearing... but did you just call
		me an ass-hole?

Clyde pokes Geoff in the shoulder.

				CLYDE
		You mad, Geoff? Cause if you are,
		you should take a shot at me...

This time Clyde shoves Geoff back even harder.

				CLYDE
		Come on, you pussy! What's the
		matter with you?

Clyde moves forward again and Geoff suddenly LASHES OUT, catching 
everyone off guard.

For an instant, Drew marvels at Geoff's tenacity.

Clyde LUNGES. He hammers Geoff with blows.

Outsizing him by forty pounds, Clyde tosses Geoff to the ground. 
Geoff struggles, but Clyde's grip proves arresting.

Clyde throws Geoff onto his stomach, forcing his face into the 
dirt. It looks as if he's ready to smother his opponent.

Drew is the first to rush in. Brad and Stevie quickly follow. It 
takes all three of them to peel Clyde off Geoff.

Clyde gets to his feet and backs away. There's great pleasure in 
his crazed eyes as he watches Geoff coughing and gasping.

				CLYDE
		Fuckin' ass-hole.

Satisfied he's handed out enough ill will for the day, Clyde turns 
away.

Drew's attentions remain on Geoff. As Clyde strolls by, he grabs 
Drew's arm and swings him around.

				CLYDE
		This way, fat-boy.

Stevie and Brad follow. As the group passes Geoff's bike, Clyde 
gives it a kick, knocking it over. Then they're gone.

Geoff pulls himself to his feet. Brushing off the mess, he heads 
up the path in search of Tiger.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - DAY

The woods here have grown long with shadows. The air is still and 
the sound of birds is conspicuously absent.

A WOODEN ARCHWAY frames the entrance to the primitive graveyard. 
Scrawled across the weatherstained boards is a child's barely 
legible attempt at "PET SEMATARY."

Geoff trepidatiously enters the clearing of crude, crowded graves. 
Collars, leashes, bird cages and other accessories adorn the 
makeshift crosses and headstones.

Geoff moves along the outer circle of markers, each crafted by a 
child's caring hands.

As he searches, he can't help but notice the heartfelt epitaphs. 
On the outer circle, he sees a crate-board marker memorializing: 
SMUCKY THE CAT... HE WAS OBEDIANT.

MOVING INWARD, the markers are older. The ones he can still read 
convey a sense of the perpetual cycle of life and death.

Here is a wide, flat, upright board planted deep in the earth: "In 
Memory of MARTA our Pet Rabit Dyed March 1 1965."

The next three rows are illegible, the inscriptions are weathered 
beyond recognition... And then, chiseled into sandstone: HANNAH 
THE BEST DOG THAT EVER LIVED 1929-1939.

And now... "MEOW." Faint. But very much alive.

Geoff picks up his pace, weaving quickly toward the center.

There, he finds Tiger. Trapped in a rusted old birdcage, its base 
swallowed by the grave.

Geoff opens the door and frees Tiger, stroking the trembling 
kitten.

Geoff's eyes are drawn to the far perimeter... to the deadfall...

THE DEADFALL looms on the outskirts of the clearing like a pile of 
skeletal remains. An abstract stairway to things beyond. A wind 
picks up just then, sending leaves skittering in waves across the 
ground.

40    OMITTED

EXT.  PET SEMATARY PATH - DAY

When Geoff turns around, he finds Drew waiting for him under the 
archway. Drew smiles, full of respect for Geoff.

				DREW
		I've never seen anybody punch
		Clyde before.

				GEOFF
			(shrugs)
		He pissed me off.

				DREW
			(his smile fading)
		Sorry about your mom.
			(beat)
		I couldn't handle not having my
		mom around. Just having Gus...

He grimaces at the thought.

				GEOFF
		My dad's not so bad.

Drew glances around at all the makeshift grave markers.

				DREW
		I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was
		dead...

				GEOFF
			(serious)
		You shouldn't ever say that about
		your parents, not even your Dad.

				DREW
		Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.

Geoff nods knowingly.

				GEOFF
		What was all that stuff about dead
		people coming back to life?

				DREW
		Nothing. It's just an old ghost
		story. Let's get out of here...

They head off, full of childhood.

INT.  KITCHEN - DUSK

Marjorie is at the stove, fixing up dinner, while Chase scans the 
newspaper at the table.

Geoff enters through the kitchen door. He moves past them without 
a word.

				CHASE
			(calling after him)
		Hey! How was your first day at
		school?

				GEOFF
			(over his shoulder)
		It sucked.

				MARJORIE
		Now is that any way to talk to
		your father?

Geoff stops for a moment, turns...

				GEOFF
		You're not my mother.

...and exits through the opposite door.

Chase looks to Marjorie and offers a sympathetic shrug.

				CHASE
		Sorry.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - DUSK

CRUDE CAGES HOUSE DOZENS OF RABBITS. Situated alongside the 
garage. A sign above the cages reads: PET RABBITS - $10.00. Bells 
positioned along the roof threaten to reveal foul play.

Gus is rigging a wire along the base of the cage.

Finishing it off, he hangs the plug next to an outside socket. 
Moving onto the next chore, he pours pressed alfalfa pellets into 
feeding slots for the hungry rabbits.

Setting the feed aside, he takes a seat. Opening one of the cages, 
he grabs a rabbit and sets it on his lap, gently petting its soft 
fur.

One of the cages starts to vibrate.

Gus gives it a look: A PAIR OF RABBITS aren't interested in 
eating, they're joined in fast and furious passion.

Gus gets a chuckle out of the sight.

				GUS
		Way to go, Romeo...

Gus replaces the rabbit in the hutch. And before he goes, HE SINKS 
THE PLUG INTO THE SOCKET. An ELECTRICAL CHARGE dances along the 
base of the cage, a deterrent for intruders.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Drew's mother, AMANDA, withdraws a roast from the oven.

Gus is at the sink, washing his hands. He turns to see Zowie 
laying at Drew's feet in the living room. Drew is watching a MUSIC 
VIDEO on TV.

				GUS
		Drew, I don't remember inviting
		Zowie in for dinner.

				DREW
		Just until he heals up?

Gus is waggling his thumb toward the back door.

Drew slumps in defeat.

Gus reaches into the cabinet and pours himself a Bourbon.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Drew walks Zowie from the house with a dish of dog food. As they 
pass the rabbit dens, Zowie alters his path. Drew gets a handful 
of his collar and pulls him back.

Across the yard is an enclosed dog run. Twenty feet long by ten 
feet wide. Drew puts Zowie inside with the dog food.

Drew strokes Zowie's mane affectionately, then backs away, closing 
the wood-framed door to the dog run.

INT.  DREW'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Amanda's about to put the roast on the table when Gus nuzzles up 
behind her, breathing down her backside. With his drink in hand, 
he sweeps her hair aside and zeros in for a kiss on the back of 
the neck.

Gus eases his free hand around between Amanda and the counter and 
presses his palm firmly into her crotch, drawing her body tight to 
him.

She stiffens at his intimate hold, uncomfortable with his timing.

				AMANDA
		Gus, please...

At the back door, Drew is watching from beyond the screen, 
disgusted by the sight of Gus pawing his mother. Drew swings the 
door open as loud as he can to signal his return.

Gus plants a last kiss on the back of Amanda's neck and backs off. 
But before he goes, he snatches a chunk of meat from the serving 
platter. Leveling his leering eyes at Amanda, he stuffs it into 
his mouth suggestively.

				GUS
		God damn, you're good.

Drew rolls his eyes and takes his seat at the table, returning his 
attention to the TV, where another MUSIC VIDEO is on.

Gus glances at the TV, annoyed by the MUSIC. He drops into his 
spot at the head of the table, blocking Drew's view. Drew leans to 
the side for a better look. Gus takes notice and leans to the same 
side to obstruct his view.

				GUS
		You're breaking the law here,
		Drew.

				AMANDA
		Really, Gus. It won't bother me.

Gus ignores her, inching forward with a confidential, harsh 
whisper.

				GUS
		Your mom's spent the last hour
		cooking. Stop being a little jerk
		and show her some appreciation.

Drew aims the remote control at Gus, as if to shut him up, and 
silences the TV.

Amanda approaches with the roast. The moment it's on the table, 
Drew starts dishing up a hefty serving. Gus spears Drew's fork 
with the serving fork.

				GUS
		Not that much appreciation. I
		thought we were gonna tone down
		that flabby ass.

				DREW
		Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud
		that you are.

				AMANDA
		Knock it off, guys...

Gus throws back a sip of Bourbon.

				GUS
			(to Drew, quietly)
		You watch that mouth of yours,
		Drew buddy.

46    OMITTED

EXT.  ZOWIE'S DOG RUN - NIGHT

MOVING THROUGH Zowie's enclosed pen, WE SEE no sign of the dog. 
REACHING the door, WE FIND that the wood around the bottom hinge 
has been chewed through. The base of the door is ajar, just enough 
for a dog to have slipped through.

EXT.  RABBIT CAGES - NIGHT

In the still of the night, Gus' rabbit pens sit unattended. And 
then WE HEAR the tinkling of dog tags. Snoozing rabbits awaken as 
Zowie lumbers INTO FRAME.

Zowie rises on his hind legs, pressing his paws to a cage. Blue 
sparks fly as Zowie is jolted with the electrical charge.

INT.  GUS' ROOM - NIGHT

The ELECTRICAL ZING. The dog's whimpering CRY. And the RINGING OF 
BELLS reach Gus in rapid succession, rousting him from his sleep. 
He rolls out of bed and grabs his robe.

				GUS
		Damn it, Drew. That dog is
		history!

Amanda stirs, groggily focusing on Gus' departing figure.

INT.  DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT

Drew swings open the door to the hallway as Gus marches by, 
stuffing shells into a shotgun. Panicked, Drew takes off after 
him.

EXT.  RABBIT CAGES - NIGHT

Zowie swings his head in the direction of the house as Gus bursts 
through the back door. Drew is one step behind.

Gus swings the gun up and fires off a SHOT.

Zowie bolts for the shadows of the hillside.

Drew rushes in and deflects the aim of the rifle.

				DREW
		Don't shoot him!

Gus' eyes are wild with anger.

				GUS
		What, Drew? What did you say?!

Gus throws Drew aside, brings the rifle back up and FIRES another 
random shot after the fleeing dog. All the while, his eyes remain 
on Drew, as if this were the boy's lesson to be learned.

He squeezes off one more SHOT...

A PAINED YELP echoes from the hillside. Zowie's yelp.

Drew whips his head aside in sickened shock. Even Gus is sobered 
by the unexpected hit.

All they can hear now are Zowie's WHIMPERING CRIES diminishing in 
the night.

Drew shoots Gus a look of such unbridled hatred that Gus is 
speechless. He backs away from Gus and darts off toward the dark 
hillside.

When Gus turns back for the house, Amanda is standing there.

				AMANDA
		Jesus, Gus, what have you done?

				GUS
		Ah, come on, Amanda, stop looking
		at me like that. He's had ample
		warning about that dog.

Amanda glares at him, an outpouring of pent-up strain.

Gus defiantly marches past Amanda, entering the house without ever 
meeting eyes with her.

EXT.  WOODS - NIGHT

Drew pauses long enough to listen for Zowie...

Nothing until a FAINT CRY drifts back at him.

DEEPER IN THE WOODS

Zowie limps INTO FRAME. Blood is flowing from the bullet wound in 
his left hindquarter, trailing from his suspended leg. Every step 
is a strain.

DREW

comes upon a break in the trees. The hanging moon outlines the 
knoll stretching beyond. And then, the strained breathing, the 
hushed WHIMPER.

Drew hesitantly approaches the crest of the knoll.

Zowie is just beyond, lying on his side at the end of the bloody 
trail. His chest rises and falls almost imperceptibly with every 
effort to survive.

Drew drops to his knees at Zowie's side and cradles the dog in his 
lap, shaking his head in denial.

Zowie's weak eyes shift, gazing longingly at Drew.

Drew strokes the fur under Zowie's chin, hardly able to see the 
dog through his glaze of tears.

Zowie's eyes drift off. His chest falls and doesn't rise again. He 
falls limp in Drew's arms. Drew hugs Zowie even tighter and he 
begins to weep.

FROM A DISTANCE

WE SEE the image of Drew with the dog cradled in his arms, 
silhouetted against the moonlit horizon.

								DISSOLVE TO:

53    OMITTED

EXT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - MORNING

Geoff appears from the garage with his bike and takes off for the 
road. A WHISTLE catches his ear.

Drew is at the edge of the woods, beckoning for Geoff.

Geoff circles around and doubles back.

				GEOFF
		I was just going by your house.
		Where's your bike?

The closer Geoff gets, the more he sees of Drew's despair. Then he 
sees the dried blood staining Drew's clothes.

				DREW
		Zowie's dead.

Geoff's heart sinks. An unspoken moment of sympathy passes between 
the boys. Fighting the emotions, Drew finally speaks.

				DREW
		I have to bury him. I don't want
		to go out there alone.

There's such grief in Drew's words that Geoff can't resist. He 
glances toward his house to make sure he hasn't been seen, then 
blends into the woods.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - DAY

Drew carries Zowie's relaxed form in his arms. Geoff is following, 
balancing a pickaxe and shovel.

Arriving at the graveyard, Geoff searches the outer perimeter for 
a vacant stretch of soil. Finding one, he lets the heavy tools 
fall to the ground.

				GEOFF
		Is this a good spot?

				DREW
		I'm not burying him here...

				GEOFF
		Why not?

				DREW
		There's a better place...

Drew heads for the base of the deadfall, with Zowie in his arms.

				DREW
		It's back here somewhere, through
		the Indian woods. I know we can
		find it...

Drew continues up the deadfall, disappearing over the crest.

Geoff gathers up the shovel and pickaxe and follows after him.

				GEOFF
		Hey, wait up!

EXT.  THE BOG - DAY

Geoff climbs over the peak of the deadfall...

Beyond is a dark swamp, A BOG, looking unlike anything one would 
expect in Maine. Tendrils of ground fog swirl about vegetation 
that looks almost prehistoric. Gnarled trees rise up from the 
murky earth, blocking the sun from view.

Geoff hurries down the other side of the deadfall to catch up with 
Drew. Somewhere off in the distance we hear an UNEARTHLY SOUND. 
Not a bird. Not any animal known to man.

Spectral shapes flicker at the edge of Geoff's vision, sinking 
back into the shadows as Geoff tries to focus on them.

				GEOFF
			(uneasy)
		Drew, where are we going?

Drew doesn't respond. He continues on without another word, hell-
bent on finding this "better place."

FURTHER ALONG - DAY

At the boundary of the bog, A STAIRWAY OF HUGE, WIDE STONES rises 
from the blanket of ground fog. Bordered by fir trees. Leading up 
the hillside. The final leg of Drew and Geoff's journey.

				DREW
		This is it... I wasn't sure if it
		even really existed.

				GEOFF
		What did?

				DREW
		The old Indian burial ground.

Geoff's eyes move to the stairway of stones.

				GEOFF
		Come on, that's just a bullshit
		story. You said so yourself...

				DREW
		What if it's not bullshit? If I
		bury Zowie there, and it works...
			(beat)
		...he'll come back alive.

				GEOFF
		Drew, I know your dog died, but...
		get a grip, man, you're freaking
		me out.

				DREW
		Look, if there was even one chance
		in a million it'd work, wouldn't
		you want to try?

Geoff feels for Drew. It's pointless to reason.

Drew starts up the stone steps. Geoff has no choice but to follow.

EXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - DAY

Even in broad daylight, the flat-topped mesa has a sense of 
foreboding isolation. There's an almost palpable sense of 
"wrongness" about this place. As if the darkness of a dying black 
hole was seeping out of the ground and spreading across the earth.

Drew and Geoff approach the circle of rocky soil. They stand at 
the border, looking it over in eerie silence.

Somewhere off in the distance we hear the unearthly SOUND again, 
only this time, it's closer.

				GEOFF
		Look, let's just get this over
		with.

Even Drew seems to have awakened from the haze he had fallen into. 
He gently sets Zowie's body on the ground.

				DREW
		If this doesn't work... don't ever
		tell anyone I did this, okay? You
		gotta promise...

Geoff nods and hands over the digging tools. Drew swings the 
pickaxe, sinking it into the ground.

				GEOFF
		You want me to help?

				DREW
		You have to bury your own. That's
		the way the Indians did it. It's
		like a rule...

Backing away from the burial ground, Geoff takes a seat on a rock 
at the border of the forest. From there, he watches.

Drew alternates the pickaxe and shovel as he clears a hole in the 
rocky ground.

WE MOVE IN ON GEOFF, who's looking on with skeptical intrigue as 
the rhythmic SOUND of the tools continues.

59    OMITTED

LATER -

A cairn is complete: a conical pile of rocks over Zowie's grave.

Drew is now sitting on the rock next to Geoff. Together, they 
stare at the cairn as if Zowie might climb from beneath at any 
moment.

				DREW
		What if he really does come back?

Geoff shrugs, pondering such a thought.

Geoff digs into his pocket and produces a pack of gum, offering 
one to Drew. With only a quick glance away from the grave, Drew 
snatches a piece and he stuffs it into his mouth. Geoff does the 
same.

They sit together in silence. Nervously chewing their gum. 
Watching the grave.

				DREW
		I've never had anyone die
		before...
			(beat)
		...but I guess you get over it. I
		mean, eventually...

				GEOFF
			(quietly)
		You never get over it.

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - AFTERNOON

The sun dips over the horizon, giving way to dusk.

EXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - DUSK

Geoff's eyes shift from the grave to the darkening sky.

				GEOFF
		It's getting pretty late. We
		better go.

				DREW
			(disappointed)
		Yeah...

They rise, leaving the burial ground. En route, Drew pauses for a 
last look at the grave.

				DREW
		So long, Zowie...

Geoff follows, glancing back at the burial ground. It looks 
magical in the twilight, not quite so sinister now.

EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT

Drew is walking home along the road, alone.

Headlights blind him as a car approaches. It slows and pulls a U-
turn, stopping at Drew's side. It's Gus' squad car. He pushes open 
the passenger door.

				GUS
		Get in.

Drew takes a step back, shaking his head.

				GUS
		Your momma's worried sick over
		you. You take off in the middle
		of the night, you don't show up
		for school. What're you trying to
		prove?

				DREW
		I'm not trying to prove anything.
			(beat)
		I was burying my dog.

Gus turns his eyes away, focusing on the dark road ahead.

				GUS
		Life is full of lessons. No one's
		above it. Not you. Not me...
		Now get in the car.

After a moment, Drew approaches the car. Without another word, Gus 
drives off.

EXT.  RABBIT CAGE - NIGHT

It's quiet now. And out of the silence comes the JINGLING of 
Zowie's dog tags. Zowie's LONG SHADOW creeps over the cage, 
distorted to monstrous proportion by the flickering light.

We move past the cages to the back porch...

We see ZOWIE'S PAW scratching at the door.

INT.  AMANDA AND GUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Amanda wakens with a start. She rises, eyes focusing on the dark 
bedroom. Gus is sound asleep next to her. Then, from outside, we 
faintly hear ZOWIE'S SCRATCHING.

Slowly, Amanda rises from bed, pulling on a bathrobe as she heads 
for the door.

EXT.  BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Amanda appears at the door. She unlatches it, stepping outside.

				AMANDA
		Zowie?

Amanda looks down and SCREAMS.

INT.  DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT

Photos of Drew with Zowie are tacked on the wall above the bed. 
The one photo of Drew, Amanda and Gus has been altered with a cut-
out head of Zowie's pasted on Gus' shoulders.

WE FIND Drew below. He's fallen asleep with his Walkman on. Even 
with his ears covered, the POUNDING at the door jolts him awake. 
Half asleep, Drew peels off the headphones.

				GUS (O.S.)
		Drew, you unlock this door! Right
		now!

				AMANDA (O.S.)
		Unlock it, Drew!

The anger in his mother's voice brings him off the bed. Gus' 
POUNDING continues.

Drew moves to the door. The inside is secured by a double dead 
bolt. Instead of unlocking them, he opens a tiny, customized 
window which gives him a view of the hall.

				DREW
		What did I do now?

				AMANDA
		Open the door, Drew.

Drew unlatches the deadbolts and steps back as Gus bursts through 
the door.

				GUS
		Where do you come off lying like
		that? "I'm burying my dog." You
		think a lie like that's never
		gonna catch up to you?

Drew backs into the bed, taking a seat.

Amanda comes through the door, and behind her is...

ZOWIE

This is our first glimpse of the resurrected dog. Fur shiny and 
wet, the gaping gunshot wound in his rear. Zowie's head hangs low, 
his eyes GLEAMING RED. The husky is covered with dirt from head to 
toe.

Drew's eyes widen in astonishment.

Zowie staggers across the room towards Drew, nails clicking on the 
floorboards. Drew shrinks back in uncertain horror as the dog 
moves closer.

Zowie absently throws his arms up onto the bed, across Drew's lap. 
And slowly, perfunctory, his tongue licks Drew's cheek. This last 
action of Zowie displaces Drew's fear. Tears well up in the boy's 
eyes.

				DREW
			(a whisper)
		Zowie...

				GUS
		Say your goodbyes. Zowie's going
		outside. You're grounded, buddy.
		That's the new law.

Drew lifts his hand from stroking Zowie's fur. His palm is covered 
with muddy blood.

				AMANDA
		I never knew an open wound could
		smell so bad...
			(beat)
		Honey, he should have been looked
		at this morning. I don't know
		what you were thinking. It's a
		wonder he's still alive.

Drew gazes into the dog's vacant eyes. It truly is a wonder.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Chase enters and stops in the doorway.

Geoff sits in front of the television with a pile of videotapes 
next to him. He's scanning through Renee's old movies with the 
remote. The sound has been turned down and the effect is a little 
eerie.

ON THE SCREEN

We see RENEE move through a scene. Geoff hits the slo-mo button 
and the image winds down. Renee's face. HER EYES stare out at us 
from the alien universe of the past.

				CHASE
			(gently)
		Geoff...

Geoff doesn't respond. He's captivated by Renee.

Chase moves into the room.

				CHASE
		Geoff!

Geoff PAUSES the tape. Renee freezes, the image flickering ever so 
slightly. For an instant, we think we see a FLASH OF Renee being 
electrocuted. But it's only an instant.

Finally, Geoff tears his eyes away from the screen, resenting his 
father's intrusion.

				GEOFF
		What?

				CHASE
		You alright?

Geoff's face softens. He nods.

				GEOFF
		Dad... do you think...
			(beat)
		...you think you and Mom would've
		gotten back together?

Chase draws closer. He takes a seat next to Geoff. The pain in his 
son's eyes is almost more than he can stand.

				CHASE
		I think so.

				CHASE
			(continuing)
		Your Mom and I loved each other,
		Geoff. Don't ever think that we
		didn't.

				GEOFF
		I still can't believe she's
		dead...

Chase moves to reach for his son, and suddenly the phone RINGS, 
shattering the moment.

Chase hesitates, but finally he rises and answers the phone.

After a moment, he returns.
				GEOFF
		Who was that?

				CHASE
		Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He
		got hurt again. I'm going over to
		take a look at him.

Geoff's eyes widen. He looks like a ghost walked over his grave.

				GEOFF
		I'm going with you.

Chase nods and exits to get his coat.

Geoff looks back at the TV once more. The image paused.

Renee staring at us from beyond the grave.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gus, Amanda, Drew and Geoff are gathered around Chase's van.

EXT./INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT

Chase lays Zowie on his side on an examining table and shines an 
overhead light onto the wound.

Geoff is looking in from outside, utterly bewildered by the 
living, breathing dog.

				CHASE
		How'd it happen?

Gus casts a threatening glance in Drew's direction.

				DREW
			(glaring at Gus)
		Some psycho hunter probably got
		trigger happy...

Chase is too busy preparing a syringe to notice the nonverbal 
exchange.

				CHASE
		I'm going to give Zowie a local
		anaesthetic so I can clean up the
		wound. I'd like to take him home
		tonight for observation.

				AMANDA
		Fine.

				DREW
		Can you keep him at your place
		until he gets better?

				CHASE
		Sure...

Drew tenderly strokes Zowie's mane as Chase administers the 
injection. Zowie stares up at Geoff with dull, blank eyes.

Drew reads Geoff's bewilderment and joins him outside the van. 
Their words are clear, but whispered.

				GEOFF
		Maybe he wasn't dead when we
		buried him.

				DREW
		He was dead. You know he was.

Geoff returns his stare to Zowie.

				DREW
		You can't tell anyone, Geoff.
		Ever.

Geoff looks into Drew's eyes and nods in understanding.

INT.  GEOFF'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tiger is curled up at the foot of Geoff's bed. Geoff climbs in, 
careful not to disturb the kitten. As he lays his head back on the 
pillow...

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Sleep tight, darling. I'll be
		with you soon.

It's a woman's VOICE. A familiar one. Now we hear the rhythmic 
CREAK of a rocking chair. And with it comes the voice again, 
humming a HAUNTING LULLABY.

Wide-eyed, Geoff turns his head toward the source...

A WOMAN'S NONDESCRIPT FORM is seated in the rocking chair across 
the room. Rocking forward, her face passes into a swath of 
moonlight...

It's Renee. With the rock of the chair, her face recedes back into 
the shadows. Her soothing HUM remains.

And again, her face passes into the swath of light. And again it 
retreats.

Geoff raises his hand, reaching out for her.

Renee's hand rises from the shadows, reaching for him.

But suddenly, THE ROOM BEGINS TO STRETCH.

The rocking chair and the bed seem distanced like polar extremes, 
mother and son hopelessly separated by forces beyond their 
control.

LIGHTNING FLASHES in the bedside window. Renee is falling farther 
and farther away.

				GEOFF
		Mom!!!

Geoff leaps from his bed as the darkness closes in and...

GEOFF

bolts up from his pillow. Awake now, face wet with perspiration. 
It was a nightmare. Except, if it was a nightmare, why do we still 
hear...

...the steady CREAK of the rocking chair.

Geoff slowly turns his head once again, repeating the actions of 
his dreams.

In the shadows, the chair is still rocking. As it comes forward 
into the moonlight, we see ZOWIE, curled up asleep on the seat of 
the chair.

Tiger is not on the bed anymore. She's up on top of the bookcase 
now, wide awake, eyes fixed on the dog. She HISSES.

Geoff stares at the rocking chair, petrified.

INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY

Chase strips off the bandage over Zowie's rear end. The wound is 
gooey and open.

Geoff reads the concern in Chase's expression. Drew is right there 
at Geoff's side, looking on.

				DREW
		What's the deal?

				CHASE
		I don't know. He's had three
		days. His immune system should've
		responded by now...

Chase puts on his stethoscope and checks under the dog's rib-cage 
for a pulse. He checks a number of places, then shakes his head, 
totally confused.

				CHASE
		I can't seem to find a pulse... it
		must be so weak, it's not
		registering...

Geoff and Drew share conspiratorial glances as Chase sets the 
stethoscope aside and extracts a blood sample.

Chase labels the capped vial of blood "ZOWIE" and carefully places 
it into a packing container. When he closes the lid, we see the 
preaddressed label:

			UNIVERSITY OF MAINE
		School of Veterinary Medicine
			Lab Samples Enclosed

Uncomfortable with Chase's investigation, Geoff reaches for Zowie.

				GEOFF
		We'll take him back to the
		kennels, Dad.

78A   OMITTED

INT.  BOARDING AREA - DUSK

THE KITTENS ARE HISSING, shrinking to the back of their kennel.

Zowie stands motionless before their cage, gazing in at them.

Geoff and Drew are nearby, putting the finishing touches on the 
bedding inside a larger boarding kennel.

				GEOFF
		You think my Dad'll figure out why
		he's not getting better?

				DREW
		You think he'd believe it if he
		did?

One of the kittens SPATS fearfully at Zowie. Geoff turns to stare 
at Zowie.

				GEOFF
		How can he not have a heartbeat?

				DREW
			(worried)
		Maybe it takes a while...

Drew lifts Zowie into the kennel. Geoff secures the door, 
something that clearly must be done from the outside.

Zowie immediately begins to pace back and forth inside the cage. 
He turns towards us and we...

								CUT TO:

EXT.  TOWN, CHASE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A SNARLING WEREWOLF rushing at us.

Chase jumps back, frightened out of his wits and we realize...

The werewolf is part of a group of COSTUMED KIDS out trick-or-
treating. The kids LAUGH at Chase's reaction and hurry on, 
dragging their candy loot bags behind them.

Chase sighs and turns to lock the office door. He's closing up for 
the night.

He climbs into his Mobile Vet Van. We HOLD ON the new sign in the 
back window: "A HALLOWEEN TREAT. FREE KITTENS." Beneath that is a 
pencil-sketch of a black arched-back kitten.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Marjorie and Geoff are at the kitchen table with the remnants of 
dinner. Geoff is doing last-minute touches on his costume.

Marjorie looks over his costume. He's got a hockey mask pushed 
back onto the top of his head.

				MARJORIE
		So who're you going as, Wayne
		Gretzky?

For effect, Geoff slips the hockey mask down over his face before 
answering.

				GEOFF
		I'm going as Jason.

				MARJORIE
		Jason? Who's he play for?

				GEOFF
		He doesn't. He hacks people up.

Geoff checks his watch.

				GEOFF
		I'm late.

As Geoff heads for the door, Chase is just coming in for the 
evening.

				CHASE
		Hey! Where're you off to?

				GEOFF
		I'm going out, Dad!

Geoff ducks out the door. Chase turns to Marjorie.

				CHASE
		Out?

				MARJORIE
		He's probably going up to the Pet
		Sematary. Kids've been going out
		there on Halloween night for
		years.

				CHASE
		What do they do up there?

				MARJORIE
		Oh, you know... drink beer, tell
		ghost stories. They try and spook
		each other out, talking about
		zombies and things...
			(she shrugs)
		It's no big deal, Chase. I did it
		when I was young.

INT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Drew is at the bathroom mirror.

				AMANDA
		Hold still. Hold still.

Amanda puts the finishing touches of color on Drew's lips. She's 
done an alarmingly good job of turning Drew into THE JOKER.

				AMANDA
		You make sure you're home by ten.
		If Gus finds out I let you go...

				DREW
			(sighs)
		I'll be home, Mom. Don't worry.
		I won't let Gus blow up again...

Amanda looks Drew straight in the eyes.

				AMANDA
		Drew, I know Gus isn't your
		father, but you never even knew
		your real father. He walked out
		on the both of us, and you
		remember that.
			(beat)
		Gus isn't that way. He has it in
		him to love us both. You just
		have to give him a chance...

Drew nods respectfully. Amanda gives him a kiss. Drawing back, she 
rubs out the lipmarks she's left on his made-up cheek.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

Dark clouds paint the foreboding sky. A broken pulse of lightning 
streaks through the dense haze.

Abandoning their bikes next to the path, Drew and Geoff approach 
the archway. The graveyard beyond is deathly silent.

They pass beneath the archway, entering the clearing.

And now, a soft, chilling VOICE drifts over the graves.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Geoff, honey. Mommy's here...

Geoff freezes in his tracks, awestruck as...

A WOMAN'S BODY

swoops down from the darkness above, materializing out of nowhere. 
A fluttering negligee. Flowing blonde hair.

RENEE'S FACE appears out of the shadows, masked with sadness.

Geoff swallows the lump in his throat.

Renee's form keeps coming. But even as she approaches, her visage 
grows less distinguishable. Just a phantom countenance now. A 
shadow framed by golden hair, resting atop a veiled body...

She's coming so fast that she's upon Geoff in no time. He fumbles 
back, startled out of his wits...

THE BODY is upon him now, flailing wildly. Geoff thrashes and 
struggles, screaming bloody murder.

Gradually, he realizes the body isn't fighting back. Geoff eases 
his struggle, lets his scream fall off.

Now he hears wild, mischievous LAUGHTER.

Drew pulls the body away. It's just a heavy wad of stuffed 
clothing: A DUMMY dressed in a negligee, capped by a blonde wig. 
It dangles near the end of a slanted wire.

Clyde, Stevie, Brad, and a half dozen other costumed KIDS appear 
from the nearby cover of bushes, doubled over in laughter.

Clyde tugs at a piece of twine that's connected to the back of the 
dummy's head and makes spooky sounds. The dummy jumps around on 
the slanted wire.

Clyde drops the dummy and saunters forward.

				CLYDE
		Look at this, Junior here
		practically shit his pants.

Clyde drops down, nose to nose with Geoff, who's still recovering.

				CLYDE
		Maybe you're too chicken to hang
		out with the rest of the boys.
		You gonna run home to Daddy now?

Geoff brushes himself off and rises to his feet. He stares into 
Clyde's eyes.

				GEOFF
		Fuck off.

Geoff pushes past Clyde and moves on into the graveyard, somehow 
managing to keep his dignity intact.

Drew follows, then the rest of the boys, leaving Clyde staring 
after them, standing alone with the dummy.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gus' squad car slows to a stop outside. Gus swings open the door 
and ambles toward the porch.

INT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Amanda draws back from the window, mortified. She nervously 
crosses to the refrigerator and grabs a beer, turning as Gus 
enters.

				AMANDA
		You're home early.

				GUS
		Nope. Just ran out of smokes.

Gus opens a kitchen drawer and fishes for a pack of cigarettes. He 
fires one up.

				GUS
		Where's the boy?

Amanda squirms.

				AMANDA
		Uh... in his room...

Gus tightens his brow, casting a suspicious eye.

A sickened look flushes through Amanda as Gus pulls his eyes away 
from her and marches upstairs.

				GUS (O.S.)
		DREW!

His feet POUND down the hallway. Silence for an instant. Then the 
powerful swing of Drew's door. Followed by Gus' hastened return 
down the hallway. And as he hustles down the stairs...

				GUS
		God damn it, Amanda! You want me
		to be a father to the boy, and as
		soon as I lay down the law, you
		let him break it!

Gus stops before Amanda.

				GUS
		Where is he?

One step away from terror, Amanda shakes her head. Gus loses his 
patience. He rips the can of beer from her grip and sends it 
flying across the room.

				GUS
		WHERE IS YOUR SON!?

Amanda sighs in quiet defeat.

				AMANDA
		The Pet Sematary.

Gus turns away and heads out the door.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Wheels spin as Gus' squad car streaks off into the night. The 
cherry top glows to life, bombarding the countryside.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

By now, nearly TWO DOZEN COSTUMED KIDS have gathered at the Pet 
Sematary. In the midst of the graves, a small story-telling 
campfire burns. A number of the boys sip beer, trying to pretend 
that the bitter after-taste doesn't bother them.

Clyde sits up front. At fourteen, he's the elder statesmen of the 
group. With a beer in one hand, and a cigarette in the other, 
Clyde is just finishing up a spooky yarn.

				CLYDE
		...yeah, that old Louis was one
		sick fuck... digging up little Gage
		like so, maggots pouring out of
		that kid's eyes...

Clyde whistles. He drags on his cigarette and puffs out a smoke 
ring. Sees he still has an audience.

				CLYDE
		Ellie was the only Creed that
		lived. Then one night a few
		months later, Ellie freaks out,
		and she hacks up her grandparents
		with an axe!
			(beat)
		Police found her licking their
		brains off the blade... They
		locked her up in a psycho ward and
		all she said were two words: 'Pet
		Sematary. Pet Sematary.'

Clyde stares at the wide-eyed kids. He grins, takes a swig of 
beer, and moves in for the kicker.

				CLYDE
		Oh yeah! Almost forgot! Here's
		the best part. Two nights ago she
		escapes. Word is, she was heading
		for Maine. Man I hope she doesn't
		show up out here.
			(feigning concern)
		Shit, we wouldn't even notice her,
		not if she's wearing a costume.
		She could be one of us...

Clyde casts a suspicious eye on the group. The kids uneasily look 
at each other, making sure they know who's behind each and every 
costume.

Suddenly Clyde drops his jaw in exaggerated horror.

				CLYDE
		Oh my Goddd!!!

Clyde lifts a trembling finger, pointing beyond the group of 
spellbound listeners.

				CLYDE
		It's... It's...

The kids are afraid to turn around, assuming Clyde's rigged up 
some unspeakable terror...

And for an instant, a look of real horror washes over Clyde's 
face...

A FIGURE

Is coming up the path beneath the archway, rising out of the 
swirling mist. A frightening silhouette, backlit by the moon.

But then Clyde realizes who it is.

				CLYDE
		Shit! It's Drew's Dad. It's
		fuckin' Gus!

Drew and the others quickly turn around, realizing it's not part 
of the punch-line scare.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

The kids quickly scramble for hiding places in the bordering 
brush, dropping their beer cans as fast as they can.

As Drew leaps to his feet, he upsets the fire, knocking one of the 
logs. A FLAMING EMBER rolls to the base of one of the brittle old 
crosses.

Drew and Geoff run for it.

EXT.  PATH, ARCHWAY - NIGHT

Gus moves quickly up the meandering path, sending the blinding 
beam of his flashlight over the graves.

				GUS
		You boys better not be drinking!

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

Through the thick woods, Drew is flanked by Geoff and Clyde.

				DREW
		Oh man, he's gonna kick my ass...

Drew starts to take off. Clyde trips him on his first stride. Drew 
hits the dirt.

				CLYDE
		Thanks for fucking up our
		Halloween, dumbshit!

Clyde recedes into the woods as Gus approaches the campfire. He 
scans the area with his flashlight, illuminating the various beer 
cans.

				GUS
		Drew, you get your ass out here!
		Front and center!

Geoff pulls Drew to his feet.

Gus passes the flashlight over the woods. Kids duck away, 
retreating from their hiding places...

The flashlight sweeps toward Drew.

Drew freezes, spotlighted by Gus' beam. A burst of LIGHTNING 
floods Drew's horrified face.

				GUS
		Get out here, Joker.

Geoff remains frozen in the woods nearby, out of Gus' light.

Behind Gus, the wooden cross is completely on fire now.

				GUS
		You out here making a fool of me?

Drew shakes his head in instant denial.

				GUS
		I'm warning you, buddy! You don't
		play by the rules, I'm gonna
		shadow your ass for eternity!

Drew makes a break from his spot in the woods. He weaves through 
the markers, arcing around the outer perimeter to avoid Gus...

...but Gus is quicker. He zigzags through the crosses and 
headstones to intercept Drew.

Gus gets a handful of Drew's collar and yanks him in.

				GUS
		You little shit!

Gus draws his free arm back and smacks Drew across the face. Drew 
goes down.

GEOFF

is looking on from the woods, horrified. Torn...

DREW

cowers on the ground, trying to scramble away.

Geoff bolts out into the firelight, staring defiantly at Gus in 
silent accusation.

Gus is beyond furious. LIGHTNING flashes again.

				GUS
		You get out of here, Geoff
		Matthews! This is between me and
		my boy!

Geoff doesn't move. Gus starts to advance forward...

...but the GROWL emanating from the woods gives him pause. 
Everyone turns...

A RUSTLING is heard in the bushes, and Zowie emerges into the 
building firelight, flashing his fangs at Gus. His eyes GLOW RED.

Gus freezes, studying Zowie.

Zowie inches forward, poised for the attack.

				GUS
		Call off your dog, Drew.

Drew shifts his eyes from Zowie to Gus, too terrified to heed such 
a command.

Zowie brushes past Drew and Geoff, moving in on Gus.

Gus' eyes shift to burning cross at his side. With a swift boot, 
he kicks over the cross and presses it into his grip.

Swinging the cross like a primitive weapon, Gus connects with the 
side of Zowie's head.

Zowie spins a full circle from the impact. But he lands on all 
fours. Unphased. Taking the next step toward Gus. There's 
something clearly not of this world in Zowie's vicious stare.

				GUS
			(terrified)
		Drew, call him off!

All Drew can manage is a faint appeal.

				DREW
		Zowie...

Zowie goes for Gus, launching into the air...

				GUS
		DREW!

...and sinking his glistening fangs into Gus' neck.

AN ERUPTION OF BLOOD showers the closest headstone.

Gus comes helplessly tumbling down with the weight of the dog. His 
SCREAMS are suddenly cut short as Zowie rips out his throat. His 
arms flail weakly at his sides, then grow still.

Drew and Geoff stare at the scene, wide-eyed with shock.

Zowie looks up from Gus' neck with dripping, red fangs. For a 
moment, his eyes settle on Drew. Then Zowie bolts off, 
disappearing into the night.

				DREW
		Oh, God. Oh, God...

Drew's eyes shift to Geoff, whose face is flushed with sickened 
fear.

				GEOFF
			(a whisper)
		Is he dead?

In dazed shock, Drew moves in for a closer look at the body.

Gus' eyes are wide open. Blood is still pumping in rhythm from his 
jugular with each weakening beat of his heart. It's a gruesome 
image against the roaring fire.

Drew kneels at Gus' side. He wants to touch him. To shake him 
awake, but with every attempt, he draws his hand back.

				GEOFF
		Is he breathing? Can you hear him
		breathing?

Drew leans forward, turning his ear toward Gus' gaping mouth. And 
as he inches closer...

GUS' FINGERS TWITCH

His hand jerks up and closes around Drew's neck. Gus stares up at 
him with his crazed menace.

Drew SCREAMS. His fingers claw at Gus' hand, desperate to pry it 
loose...

...but then, Gus' hand relaxes as his last, dying ounce of 
strength fades away.

Drew shrinks back, crouching over the lifeless body as the blazing 
firelight dances over it. He turns his tear-filled gaze to Geoff.

				DREW
		Oh man, Geoff... we killed him...
		we killed him...
			(beat)
		What're we gonna do?

Geoff draws closer and looks down into the dead man's face.

				GEOFF
		We could bring him back.

Drew's eyes widen at the suggestion.

And now, GAZING DOWN on Gus' body, and on the boys, WE PULL UP 
INTO A SLOW SPIRAL...

We move ever higher, until we are LOOKING DOWN UPON THE ENTIRE PET 
SEMATARY. At the SOUND of a shovel cutting into rocky soil, we...

								CUT TO:

95    OMITTED

EXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - NIGHT

Three quick shots:

A SHOVEL sinking into the earth.

GUS falling head down into the grave, landing with a heavy THUD.

SOIL covering Gus' lifeless face.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Amanda is pacing back and forth on the porch, checking her watch 
every few steps. She sighs with relief as...

Drew appears from the darkness of the woods.

Drew dismounts his bike and carries it up the front porch steps, 
strangely silent. His clothes and face are caked with dirt.

				AMANDA
		Jesus, Drew, do you know what time
		it is? Did Gus ever find you?

Drew moves on past her into the house.

				AMANDA
			(calling after him)
		Drew? Drew, what happened?

				DREW
			(trying not to lose
			it)
		Nothing happened, Mom. We just
		ditched Gus, that's all...

Drew pauses and stares out into the unknown darkness of the night.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase is in the study, perusing some files. He looks into the 
hallway as Geoff arrives home, then glances at the clock. It's 
late. Very late.

Chase rises. He's both angry and relieved. Right now, though, the 
anger's winning out.

				CHASE
		Were you drinking?

Geoff absently shakes his head. He slumps back against the wall, 
drained from the night's horrors.

				CHASE
		Drew's Mom called hours ago, the
		rest of the kids were back by ten.
		Where the hell were you boys?

Geoff shrugs, trying to mask his uneasiness.

				GEOFF
		Just out.

				CHASE
		"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.
			(beat)
		Look, I've been letting you get
		away with a lot these past few
		weeks, but I'm not going to stand
		for crap like this. I don't care
		if it's Halloween... it's a school
		night, and if you do this again...

				GEOFF
			(cutting him off)
		I'm really tired, Dad... can I just
		go to sleep?

Chase stops and looks at his son. Geoff's exhaustion is self-
evident.

				CHASE
			(sighing)
		Go on... we'll talk about this in
		the morning.

Geoff nods and heads for the stairs.

INT.  GEOFF'S ROOM - NIGHT

THE CLOCK is creeping up on 2AM...

THUNDER rumbles outside in the distance and rain starts to spatter 
the window panes.

Geoff's eyelids fall beneath unbearable weight and he nods off to 
sleep. Tiger is sprawled out on the blanket against his chest. 
Slowly, we move back towards the window...

In a flash of LIGHTNING--

GUS' FACE

APPEARS OUTSIDE. Washed in the haunting white glow. Streaked with 
mud. Caked with blood. Staring in at Geoff.

Geoff is jolted awake by the delayed clap of THUNDER and whips his 
gaze to the window. Before he can focus...

...the pulse of lightning fades away. And with it, Gus' face. Only 
darkness remains beyond the window pane.

Geoff returns his gaze to the bedroom, unaware of Gus' appearance. 
He sinks back to his pillow, already hurtling towards sleep once 
more.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

MOVING IN ON the house, WE SINGLE OUT a rain-obscured window on 
the ground floor, the window to Drew's bedroom.

INT.  DREW'S ROOM - NIGHT

Drew is sound asleep, curled up under the sheets. He clutches his 
pillow like a life preserver.

				GUS (O.S.)
		Drew!

Drew's eyes flutter open. He turns towards the window. Now, he 
hears some activity outside. And then Gus' hushed voice.

				GUS (O.S.)
		Drew, buddy. I lost my keys.

Drew goes saucer-eyed. He swallows the swelling lump in his throat 
and rises from his bed.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Drew steadies his quivering fingers just enough to sink the key 
into the deadbolt on the back door. Drawing the CREAKING door 
open, he gazes out back.

				DREW
			(scared shitless)
		Gus?

Nothing moves outside. The longer Drew watches, the more eerie 
each shadow becomes. Spooked, Drew steps back inside, quickly 
closing the door. He locks it back up again.

When he turns around, he's face to face with GUS.

Drew stiffens, backing into the wall.

				DREW
		H-how'd you get in?

Gus offers a nightmarish grin and raises his hand, dangling his 
keys.

				GUS
		Found 'em.

Drew's eyes follow a flow of blood from Gus' neck to the floor. 
Gus looks down at his dirty, bloody footprints. He's tracked blood 
all over the linoleum.

				GUS
		I'm makin' a mess of your mother's
		kitchen floor...
			(beat)
		I need a shower...

Gus turns without another word and heads for the stairs.

Drew's mouth drops in utter astonishment as he watches Gus 
clumsily climbing the stairs.

After a moment, he returns his attention to the bloody kitchen 
floor. Tearing off a wad of paper towels, he wets them and begins 
to mop up Gus' tracks.

103   OMITTED

AT THE MIRROR - NIGHT

Gazing vacantly at his reflection, Gus covers his ravaged throat 
with a gauze strip, wrapping it around the circumference of his 
neck again and again and again.

Behind him, the shower is running, filling up the bathroom with 
steam.

Finishing the dressing off with a sloppy tape job, Gus reaches for 
the pajamas hanging nearby. He lazily buttons the buttons, failing 
to notice their alignment is off. He never did bother to shower. 
He's still covered with mud.

INT.  AMANDA AND GUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gus enters from the steamy bathroom. The shower is still running.

Amanda stirs, sleepy eyes focusing on him.

				AMANDA
		Gus, hon. I'm sorry about
		tonight. You coming to bed?

Gus lifts the covers and climbs in. With him comes the chill of 
death. Gus presses up behind her. His hand moves beneath the 
sheets, finding its way over the curve of her waist, caressing. 
Amanda shivers.

				AMANDA
		God, you're ice cold...
			(turning)
		...and you smell! Lord, what did
		you get yourself into?

It's then that Amanda sees the bandage around Gus' neck. Blood is 
seeping through the gauze.

				AMANDA
		My God, Gus, what happened?

Amanda reaches out to touch him, but Gus stops her hand short of 
the bandage. Instead, he leans forward and clutches one of her 
breasts.

Amanda tries to twist away.

				AMANDA
		Gus... stop it! What's wrong with
		you?!

But Gus doesn't stop. He throws himself on top of Amanda, roughly 
forcing her back onto the bed.

				AMANDA
		Gus!!!

Amanda's hands beat at Gus' face and back, to no apparent effect. 
With one arm forced against Amanda's throat, he rips open her 
nightgown with the other.

We pull away from Amanda's struggles, back to the bathroom. The 
shower running on and on, cloaking the bedroom in steam.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Geoff is riding along the highway, his backpack full of school 
books. Drew is waiting on the shoulder ahead. When Geoff 
approaches, Drew hops on his bike, getting up to speed.

WITH THE BOYS - RIDING

Geoff keeps glancing at Drew, waiting for him to say something. 
Drew maintains his enigmatic expression.

				GEOFF
		Well?

Drew nods. Geoff's eyes widen in disbelief.

				DREW
		Picture this... Gus comes down to
		breakfast and he doesn't say a
		word. He even kind of smiles,
		like he forgot he hates me. And
		then you know what he does? He
		serves me an extra helping of
		pancakes...
			(beat)
		I asked him if I was still
		grounded... "no." I asked him if
		you could spend the night, and he
		nods. It's like we're a family.
		A real family.

The words have their own meaning for Geoff, who stares to the road 
ahead in deep thought.

				DREW
		It's weird...

				GEOFF
		What do you mean?

				DREW
		It's like he's not Gus anymore.
		He's different. You know, like
		Zowie...

They share a chuckle that ends in silent uneasiness.

INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY

Chase enters with a stack of files tucked under his arm. As he 
organizes them in the large filing cabinet with the others, he 
listens to his messages on the answering machine.

The current caller sounds a little annoyed...

				MESSAGE MACHINE
		...Doctor Matthews, this is
		Elliot Rudman at the university.
		I've looked over the blood
		specimen you sent us on canine
		Zowie...

Chase abandons the filing and immediately returns the call. While 
it RINGS...

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Knock, Knock, Doc.

A MOTHER and TWO TODDLERS are standing in the doorway to Chase's 
office, trying not to intrude on his call.

				MOTHER
			(quiet whisper)
		We saw your sign. Are there any
		kitties left?

Chase studies them. They look like decent people.

				CHASE
		Take your pick. They're in the
		boarding area. You can go on
		back.

Chase turns away as his phone call is answered.

				CHASE
		Elliot, it's Chase...

INT.  LAB/INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE (INTERCUT) - DAY

ELLIOT RUDMAN has the phone tucked under his chin, in the midst of 
an autopsy. The WHIRR of the saw drowns out his words as he shaves 
the dome off a dog's skull.

				CHASE
		I didn't get that...

The pathologist turns off the saw. His words become audible.

				RUDMAN
		...I said next time it might help
		if you took the blood sample while
		the animal was still alive...

The comment hits Chase out of left field.

				CHASE
		What?

				RUDMAN
		I don't know what you expected to
		find, Matthews. There's nothing
		wrong with the antigens, nothing
		to indicate an unusual death...

				CHASE
		Wait, there must be some mix-up.
		He was... the dog is alive.

				RUDMAN
		Not this dog. There wasn't enough
		oxygen in those red cells to pump
		life into a flea.

Chase is baffled, speechless.

				RUDMAN
		You took over for Doctor Yolander?

				CHASE
		Yes... why?

				RUDMAN
		Because the last person that sent
		me blood from a dead animal was
		Yolander...

INT.  BOARDING AREA - DAY

The kennels have been cleaned up, but the room retains its eerie, 
dimly lit quality.

The DRIP of a faucet reverberates from the far corner.

The mother enters with a toddler clinging to each hand. Their 
smiles fade at the unsettling surroundings. Slowly, they move down 
the row of kennels.

				TODDLER
		Where are the kitties?

INT.  CHASE'S OFFICE - DAY

				CHASE
			(into the phone)
		Look, this is ridiculous...

Suddenly, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS pierce the air. Chase drops the 
phone and rushes out of the office...

INT.  BOARDING AREA - DAY

The toddlers are screaming at the top of their lungs. Mom is 
burying their heads in her dress.

Chase bursts in as the mother hastily retreats for the exit. Her 
horrified eyes flash by Chase. In an instant, she and the toddlers 
are gone.

Chase remains alone, moving down the long row of kennels with 
mounting trepidation...

Zowie's cage is empty.

Chase shifts his troubled gaze to the...

DRIP DRIP DRIP... as a PUDDLE OF BLOOD forms on the floor.

Chase raises his eyes...

THE KITTENS' KENNEL -

Nothing but bloody ribbons of torn flesh are left of the kittens, 
dangling from the grid gate. DRIPPING.

Chase looks away as a new level of fear runs through him.

				CHASE
		Jesus...

It's too gruesome even for a man of Chase's background. Fighting 
the gag reflex, he searches the room for the missing dog...

...and then he spots the broken glass window vent along the floor. 
And the pile of blood-spattered shards laying on the tile.

EXT.  SCHOOL, STREET - DAY

Clyde, Stevie, and Brad are loitering near the front bike racks. 
Clyde's smoking away.

As Geoff and Drew come out of the school, the trio moves to 
intercept them.

				CLYDE
		Hey!

Just then, Chase's van pulls at the curb, interrupting whatever 
trouble was about to happen.

Clyde looks from the van to Geoff, and falls back.

				DREW
		Saved by the bell...

Chase hurriedly rolls down the passenger window as Geoff and Drew 
approach.

				GEOFF
		Can I sleep over at Drew's
		tonight?

Chase is preoccupied with other concerns.

				CHASE
		Yeah... that's fine...
			(beat)
		Listen, Drew, I got the tests back
		on Zowie. He's not well. Don't
		ask me how, but he got out this
		afternoon...

Geoff and Drew exchange concerned looks.

				CHASE
		If he finds his way home, call me,
		no matter what the hour, okay? And
		don't try to approach him.
		Whatever he's got might be 
		infectious. Understand?

The boys nod their heads.

Chase masks his anxiety with a weary smile. With a wave, he speeds 
up, leaving the boys.

INT.  CHASE'S VAN - MOVING

A MAP of Maine is unfolded on the passenger seat. Chase is on the 
car phone.

				CHASE
		Can I have the address for Quentin
		Yolander?

Chase jots an address down on the map. He turns the van up a 
mountain road, winding through the towering pines.

EXT.  YOLANDER'S CABIN - DAY

A remote, rustic dwelling nestled into the desolate backwoods.

INT.  YOLANDER'S CABIN - DAY

QUENTIN YOLANDER rocks back in his thick hide chair. His world is 
closed off from daylight by the extensive blinds.

He's holding a SMALL POODLE in his lap. Its big brown eyes are 
staring back at him.

				YOLANDER
		You'd be so much more interesting
		with blue eyes...

And now, ONE OF THE POODLE'S EYES POPS OUT. Yolander's finger 
comes through from beneath the eye socket.

On closer examination, WE REALIZE that the dog is not alive at 
all. Yolander has his hand inside the hollowed-out carcass.

He carefully looks over a container of glass eyes on his desk and 
selects the right shade of blue. A shot of whiskey rests nearby.

Yolander reaches up into the poodle's belly and fits the blue eyes 
securely into place.

There's a KNOCK at the door. Yolander ignores it. Maybe he's deaf. 
Another KNOCK. Yolander turns towards the door, annoyed at the 
intrusion. And behind that annoyance, there's a touch of madness.

PULLING BACK, we see the rest of the room. Stuffed animals are 
crowded from floor to ceiling. A product of Yolander's obsession 
with TAXIDERMY.

				YOLANDER
		I'm immortalizing a poodle. State
		your business!

Yolander presses some stuffing into the poodle's gut and begins to 
sew up the stomach.

				CHASE (O.S.)
		Doctor Yolander. This is Chase
		Matthews. I've moved into your
		offices in Ludlow...

Yolander's attention remains on the needle as he meticulously 
stitches the belly.

				CHASE (O.S.)
			(continuing)
		...I sent a blood sample out for
		analysis. They tell me I sent
		them the blood of a dead animal...

At this, Yolander breaks his concentration. The needle pricks his 
hand. Blood oozes from the puncture, dripping onto the dog's 
stomach.

				CHASE (O.S.)
		...a dog...

Yolander rises from his seat and swings open the door.

Chase stands in the doorway, startled. It doesn't take a genius to 
figure out that the good Doctor is drunk.

				YOLANDER
			(glaring)
		Why are you bothering me about
		this? Can't you leave it be?

				CHASE
		I... um...

Chase glances to the right and steps back...

A BOBCAT

is perched nearby, frozen in mid-pounce. It takes a second for 
Chase to register that the bobcat has been stuffed.

Now Chase sees the rest of the room... a whole zoo of stuffed 
animals, looking like a rural version of the Bates Motel.

				CHASE
			(momentarily thrown)
		...the pathologist... he said that
		you had reported a similar 
		incident... with a cat...

				YOLANDER
		The Creed cat, that's right.
		Bastard's name was "Church".
			(grins)
		Let me guess. Your dog's tissue
		isn't healing, pupils aren't
		dilating... maybe you can't find a
		heartbeat?

				CHASE
		Exactly! I thought it might be
		some sort of blood condition...
		immune deficiency or...

Quentin Yolander laughs. It's disconcerting.

				YOLANDER
		There's no "blood condition." The
		dog isn't sick, it's dead.
			(drawing closer)
		And so was Creed's cat. And so
		was his wife the night she was
		killed for the second time...

As Yolander moves forward, Chase backs up. He bumps into a whole 
shelf of stuffed creatures. To his right, A RAVEN sits frozen on 
its perch. Chase regards Yolander as being completely insane.

				YOLANDER
			(menacing)
		You want some advice, friend? You
		get in your car, you pick up your
		family... and you get the hell out
		of that town.

				CHASE
		Well... uh... thanks...

Chase continues to back out of the door. On his way out, he bumps 
into the stuffed raven's perch...

...only this raven isn't stuffed. It spreads its wings and 
SCREECHES.

Chase just about jumps out of his skin, tripping out of the 
doorway.

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gus reaches into the cage and grabs a rabbit by the ears. He 
casually snaps the neck. Laying the limp carcass on a stump 
cutting board, he quickly skins it.

Hanging above the cages, there is now a line of furry pelts. Half 
a dozen.

Drew and Geoff are on the porch, looking on.

				DREW
		I guess we're having rabbit for
		dinner.

Gus hangs the freshly skinned fur to dry and violently snatches 
another hare from the cage.

INT.  DREW'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The dinner from Hell. Geoff splats a helping of mashed potatoes 
onto his plate, all the while keeping a wary eye on Gus...

Gus is serving himself a chunk of rabbit. It hits the edge of the 
plate, teetering on the rim. He passes the dish on.

Gus meets Geoff's gaze. For a moment, there's a deadened, vacant 
look in Gus' eyes. Then slowly, a limp smile creeps over him, 
sending a chill up Geoff's spine.

Geoff averts Gus' stare. Gus helps himself to potatoes and passes 
the plate on. He lets go of it short of reaching Drew. Only Drew's 
quick hands save it from hitting the table.

Amanda comes to the table with a dish of LIMA BEANS. She casts Gus 
a cold, hateful stare and sets the limas down. She's still angry 
over last night.

Gus dishes a sloppy scoop and passes it toward Drew. Like before, 
he lets it drop too early. This time Drew doesn't save it. The 
lima beans shower the floor.

				AMANDA
		God damnit, Gus! This isn't
		funny!

Amanda fetches a dishtowel and kneels to clean up the mess.

Geoff and Drew exchange quick glances. As Geoff reaches for the 
salt...

...Gus intercepts his wrist. Geoff gulps.

Gus drops his jaw, revealing a gooey mass of food. But the frozen 
smile and the look in his eyes convey dementia rather than 
playfulness.

Geoff and Drew can't believe their eyes. They laugh uncomfortably. 
There's no other response.

Gus LAUGHS too... awkward, terrible laughter. Spitting out food 
over his shirt and plate as he does so.

The boys stop laughing, but Gus just keeps on going.

Amanda stares at Gus and carries the mess out of the room.

Through his laughter, Gus' bandage has slipped down, exposing part 
of his ragged wound. The wound glistens, oozing CLOTTED BLOOD and 
GOOEY PUS.

Drew hesitantly reaches for Gus' neck, readjusting the bandage.

Grossed out, Geoff averts his eyes and sets his fork aside.

INT.  DREW'S ROOM - LATER

Geoff and Drew enter. Drew swiftly secures the deadbolts on his 
door.

				GEOFF
		What was that all about? You
		think he's trying to scare us?

				DREW
		I don't know but I'm not taking
		any chances...

Drew opens the chest at the foot of his bed and produces a 
SHOTGUN. A box full of shells spill as he withdraws the gun. 
Cracking open the chamber, Drew loads two shells into the chamber.

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

A moonlit horizon. Unmoving. Silent. The kind of silence that 
pulls at the darkest recesses of imagination.

And now, A LONE FIGURE appears on the horizon. It's Zowie, moving 
at a deliberate pace.

ATOP A KNOLL

Zowie takes pause. The TINKLING of his collar tags resumes as he 
drops over the horizon line, cutting down the hill.

INT.  CHASE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase sits in the den, looking exhausted and disheveled. In front 
of him, the t.v. is on. RENEE'S FACE stares out at us. Chase hits 
the remote and rises, moving to the back door.

He checks the deadbolt, then secures the chain link as a backup. 
From somewhere outside, we hear a DOG HOWL.

Chase's eyes drop to the DOGGY DOOR, a holdover from the previous 
owner. Chase bends down and latches the door.

Now he pauses at his desk... considers... then pulls something out 
of the bottom drawer. It's a gun.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Chase moves to the front of the house, securing that door. 
Satisfied, he turns off the light and heads upstairs...

WE STAY AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS -

MOVING INTO DARKNESS, shadow and form begin to take shape. We hear 
a low GROWL and see a flash of RED EYES. It's Zowie. Already in 
the house.

123   OMITTED

INT.  CHASE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Coming through the door from the downstairs, Chase stops cold.

RENEE is on the bed. Clothed in a negligee. Lying across a blanket 
of rose petals. Her eyes meet his with powerful longing.

				RENEE
		Chase. I miss you so much...

				CHASE
			(dry-mouthed)
		Renee...

Chase approaches. Slowly. Fearful that this is all a dream.

Renee reaches out her hand. They touch. This is not a dream.

				CHASE
		Oh God...

Chase absently sets his gun on the bedside table as Renee draws 
his body to hers.

They kiss. Once. Twice. Not a dream.

Renee rolls Chase over, forcefully climbing on top. Chase sinks 
down into the center of the bed as Renee straddles him.

Slowly, Renee slips off the top of her negligee...

				RENEE
			(a whisper)
		I can come back, Chase...

...and sinks down on top of him, kissing him hungrily.

Her nipples graze his chest, then her breasts flatten as she 
grinds her hips against his.

Almost instantly, the weight of her grows unbearable. Chase fights 
to pull his mouth from hers, to breathe...

				CHASE
		No... Too heavy.

There is no pleasure in his words, just unmitigated horror as 
Renee's body comes down on him harder.

				CHASE
		...can't breathe... I can't...

CHASE'S EYES

pop open, frenzied, AS HE COMES OUT OF HIS DREAM.

Chase is alone on the bed, but he's still feeling the weight 
pressing down on him...

ZOWIE

is laying on his chest, staring back at him, rearing his teeth in 
a growl...

Zowie LUNGES forward, jaws flashing, and Chase twists sideways...

GNASHING TEETH connect with Chase's shoulder, then with the 
pillows where Chase's head used to be. A BLIZZARD OF DOWN FEATHERS 
ERUPTS...

Chase scrambles out of bed, flailing for the gun on the bedside 
table...

THE GUN spins out of reach and across the floor...

Chase DIVES for the gun and reaches it just as Zowie leaps to the 
floor. In a panic, Chase FIRES WILD...

Zowie abruptly turns and SMASHES through the bedroom window, 
sending glass flying.

EXT.  HOUSE - NIGHT

Zowie slides down the room and leaps to the ground below, 
disappearing into the night.

INT.  CHASE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Chase looks on in terror. Finally he pulls his eyes away from the 
shattered window...

...and catches a glimpse of something in the dresser mirror. 
Something that sends a chill up his spine.

The flurry of down feathers is floating to the mattress. But 
intermingling with the feathers are a handful of ROSE PETALS, 
slowly settling to the bed.

INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

Chase is bare-chested at the mirror, applying a dressing to the 
dog bite on his shoulder.

Marjorie appears in the doorway with a basket of laundry. She 
stops short at the sight of Chase standing there in his boxers.

Chase catches her reflection in the mirror and is startled.

				MARJORIE
		I didn't mean to... I was going to
		empty the hamper...

Chase turns, shaking off the scare.

				CHASE
		It's okay.

Marjorie's eyes can't help but fix on the dog bites scattered over 
Chase's chest and arms.

				MARJORIE
		What happened to you?

				CHASE
		I had a little run-in with Zowie.

				MARJORIE
		You sure did...

Marjorie sets the laundry aside.

				MARJORIE
		Here, let me do that...

Marjorie looks over the antiseptics Chase has laid out on the 
sink. Saturating a wad of gauze with hydrogen peroxide, she gently 
cleanses the gashes on his arms.

There's nothing overtly sexual in her actions, but the gentleness 
of her touch doesn't go unnoticed by Chase.

				MARJORIE
		I hope he doesn't have rabies.

				CHASE
		He doesn't. I don't know what he
		has, but I'm hoping to God it's
		not infectious...

Chase stops and looks at Marjorie's reflection in the mirror.

				CHASE
		Marjorie... what do you know about
		the Creed murders?

Marjorie stiffens for a moment. Obviously the Creeds are a sore 
spot for the people in this town.

				MARJORIE
		Did you ever play that game where
		you pass a story down a row of
		people and see how screwed up it
		gets by the time it's done?
		People say Louis Creed's son came
		back from the dead and it drove
		him crazy...
			(she rolls her eyes)
		He killed his wife and himself,
		and that's the end of story.
		Anything else belongs in the
		National Enquirer.

Marjorie tapes the bandage over Chase's shoulder too tight. 
Chase's groan snaps her back to the reality at hand.

				MARJORIE
		Sorry. Now tell me what that has
		to do with Zowie?

Chase closes his eyes, shutting out the pain.

				CHASE
		I wish I knew.

INT.  LIBRARY - DAY

Chase approaches the counter, looking to the ELDERLY LIBRARIAN for 
assistance.

				LIBRARIAN
		What are you looking for, Hon.

				CHASE
		Do you have anything on the Creed
		murders? I can't find the 
		microfilm from that period...

The librarian's smile vanishes. She lowers her voice, focusing her 
attention on some paperwork.

				LIBRARIAN
		We don't keep anything on file
		from that far back.

				CHASE
		But you've got files from the
		previous years...

				LIBRARIAN
		We have nothing on the Creed
		murders, sir. Can I get you
		something else?

Chase looks around and realizes that a dozen hostile eyes are on 
him. TOWNSPEOPLE withholding a dark secret.

Chase slowly backs away, eager to escape the field of hostile 
stares.

EXT.  HIGHWAY, COUNTRY BRIDGE - DAY

Geoff and Drew have parked their bikes beneath the bridge. They 
sit on the bank of the creek below, watching the water run past. 
Geoff is lost in thought.

				GEOFF
		Do you think everyone that came
		back would be like Gus?

				DREW
		I don't know...
			(thinking)
		...maybe it depends on what you
		were like before you...

				GEOFF
			(finishing)
		Dies?

Drew nods. He tosses a stone into the creek, then looks up at the 
sun and sighs.

				DREW
		I gotta go back and do my
		chores...

				GEOFF
		Go later...

Drew shakes his head.

				DREW
		I can't. Gus'd kill me if I
		showed up late.

The boys reluctantly rise and move to their bikes, walking them up 
the steep grade to the highway.

				DREW
		See you at school Monday?

Geoff nods. He looks at Drew. The boy is genuinely frightened. But 
there's nothing either of them can do. They're trapped in their 
roles as kids.

Both boys mount their bikes. Drew turns...

				DREW
		You ever think about running away?

				GEOFF
		All the time.

Drew smiles at this. He waves to Geoff and pedals off.

				DREW
			(calling back)
		See ya!

Geoff waves and heads off in the opposite direction.

WE STAY ON DREW -

As he moves down the road. Up ahead, we hear the approaching WHINE 
of a motorcycle...

CLYDE

rips by on an old junkyard fixer-up MOTORCYCLE, and he's heading 
in Geoff's direction.

Seeing him, Drew brakes and pulls his bike into a U-turn, pumping 
furiously to catch up with Geoff.

ON GEOFF -

Now Geoff hears the WHINE of Clyde's motorcycle. He glances 
back...

Clyde's spotted him, REVVING the engine.

Geoff pedals like mad, but it's no use. Clyde is closing in on 
him, grinning sadistically.

Clyde sweeps in next to him, calling out over the ENGINE.

				CLYDE
		Well look who's here!

Clyde veers right, forcing Geoff towards the shoulder of the 
road...

131   OMITTED

132   OMITTED

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The ground ahead drops toward a ravine. Geoff has nowhere to go 
but down the slope. Clyde is right there beside him...

Laughing, Clyde reaches over and grabs ahold of Geoff's handlebar. 
He jerks it sideways...

				CLYDE
		Oops!

Geoff's front wheel turns perpendicular. The bike pitches forward, 
THROWING Geoff into the dirt ahead...

Clyde broadies his bike to a stop. With the engine idling, he hops 
off.

Before Geoff can get to his feet, Clyde has picked up Geoff's bike 
and planted it upside down in the dirt.

				CLYDE
		Guess your Dad's not here to save
		you now, is he?

Clyde gets a handful of Geoff's collar and drags him over toward 
the bike. With his free hand, Clyde cranks the pedal.

The back wheel spins. Faster and faster.

				CLYDE
		You ever seen a tire take off a
		nose?

Through the blur of the spokes, WE SEE Geoff, eyes widening 
fearfully.

				CLYDE
		Neither have I.

Clyde forces Geoff's face toward the spinning tread.

				CLYDE
		Might even kill ya. Wheel might
		chew right into your brains. You
		could visit your mom.

Geoff tries to get a hold on the frame of the bike for leverage, 
but his arms don't reach beyond the spinning wheel.

Clyde is full of deranged glee, fueled by Geoff's fear.

But now, A HAND grabs the wool scarf streaming from the back of 
Clyde's neck and yanks him off of Geoff.

Clyde reels, finding...

GUS standing there behind him. He looks bad. Real bad. His 
bandages are unwound and his ruined neck is still seeping. His 
face is unearthly pale. He's deteriorated considerably since 
yesterday.

				CLYDE
			(startled)
		Jesus Christ, Gus!

Gus levels a threatening gaze at Geoff.

				GUS
		Go home.

But Geoff remains frozen. Gus fixes him with a stare that could 
turn flesh to stone.

				GUS
		I said... GO HOME!!

Geoff snaps out of it and flips his bike over. He gets a running 
start, making a beeline for the highway without ever looking back.

ON THE KNOLL NEARBY

Drew stops short of the ravine, watching from afar as Gus steps 
toward Clyde.

BELOW -

Clyde throws up his hands. He's frightened, but he tries to muster 
up a cocky front.

				CLYDE
		Come on, Gus, I was just fucking
		with him...
			(nervous laughter)
		What're you gonna do? Give me a
		ticket? I mean, shit, Gus...

Clyde grows increasingly wary of Gus' evil stare. Gus steps 
closer.

				CLYDE
		You can't lay a finger on me...

Wrong. Gus lashes out, backhanding Clyde across the face.

Clyde falls to the ground, flat on his back, with his nose gushing 
blood. Terrified.

Gus turns around and lifts the idling motorcycle. With one hand 
under the back of the seat, and the other working the accelerator 
handlebar, Gus advances toward Clyde.

Gus kicks the bike into gear and REVS the accelerator.

THE REAR WHEEL SPINS. On the pavement it would be moving forty 
miles an hour.

Clyde can't believe his eyes. Pleading.

				CLYDE
		Gus... what are you doing?

				GUS
		I'm just fucking with you...

Gus plants his foot against Clyde's chest, pinning him, and lowers 
the spinning rear wheel TOWARD CLYDE'S NECK. The wheel WHINES like 
a circular saw.

Gus lowers the wheel. Then jerks it away, flashing a sadistic 
smile.

Just when Clyde thinks Gus is backing off, the wheel comes down 
again...

				CLYDE
			(wailing)
		Stop it, man! Stop it!!!

Gus gets into the rhythm as he lowers and retracts the spinning 
wheel at the terrified bully.

But this time, as the wheel comes down...

CLYDE'S WOOL SCARF, defying gravity, gets swept up, swallowed into 
the GEARS.

And along with the scarf, here comes Clyde's SCREAMING face. We 
can only imagine the gruesome instant that follows.

BLOOD sprays up over Gus' arms and chest. And then we hear the 
sound of CRUNCHING BONES jamming the motorcycle's gears.

				GUS
			(dead-pan)
		Whoops.

He bares his teeth in a death's head grin.

ON THE KNOLL

Drew has witnessed the killing. He's mortified.

BELOW -

Gus tosses the bloody motorcycle aside, slowly raising his eyes up 
to where Drew stands. His eyes meet Drew's.

Drew hastily jerks his bike around and takes off.

Gus starts after him on foot.

INT.  DREW'S HOUSE - DAY

Drew rushes through the front door, SLAMMING it behind him and 
throwing the deadbolt.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

Drew climbs onto his bed and grabs his shotgun from the gun rack. 
His fingers shake as he flips off the safety.

				DREW
		Oh man...

Just then we hear the CRACKLE of a POLICE P.A. and Gus' amplified 
VOICE coming from the yard outside.

				GUS (V.O.)
			(mocking)
		This is the Police, come out of
		the house with your hands up!

Gus finishes his words with a burst of FEEDBACK and then amplified 
MANIACAL LAUGHTER.

Drew's eyes go wide with terror. He creeps out into the hall, 
clutching the gun.

INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

Drew tries to look out the window. Then we hear a low, guttural 
GROWL. Drew slowly turns...

Zowie is standing down the hall, leveling a dead stare. Zowie 
takes the first step forward.

				DREW
			(horrified)
		No, Zowie! It's me!

Pleading, Drew slowly retreats down the hallway.

Along the way, he backs right into...

GUS, grinning from ear to ear.

Drew recoils against the wall, swinging up his shotgun.

				DREW
		Stay back!

But Gus just keeps on grinning. He takes a step forward...

Drew pulls the trigger...

And CLICK! Nothing happens. The chambers are empty.

				GUS
		Forget something, Drew buddy?

Gus raises his hand. He's holding the shotgun shells. He lets them 
fall to the floor.

Suddenly Gus wrenches the gun from Drew's hands. He swings it 
and...

...Drew SCREAMS and ducks beneath the blow, as the shotgun butt 
SMASHES a hole in the wall above his head. Gus flings the shotgun 
aside and LUNGES for Drew...

Drew races down the hallway to the back door. He turns the latch. 
The deadbolt has been locked from the inside.

Drew's eyes whip to the keyholder on the wall. All the keyhooks 
are empty.

Here comes the JINGLING of keys in Gus' pockets as he comes down 
the hall...

Drew dashes away from the back door.

Gus' eyes shift from Drew's fleeing form to A BOX OF TOOLS in the 
service closet.

AT THE FRONT DOOR

Drew jimmies the knob. Again, the deadbolt is locked from the 
inside. Tears are streaming down Drew's face now.

FOOTSTEPS approach. Drew spins around...

Gus is advancing, WITH A HAMMER tight in his grip.

				GUS
			(crazed)
		You have the right to remain
		silent...

WHAM! Gus SMASHES the hammer into the wall to punctuate his words. 
Plaster goes flying.

				GUS
			(continuing)
		...while I bash your fucking head
		in!

Drew's eyes dart frantically, looking for a way out. The closest 
route of escape is UP THE STAIRS.

Down the hallway, Zowie starts running forward. Drew's caught 
between a rock and a hard place...

				GUS
		You have the right to a lawyer,
		but you won't need one...

He runs for it. Gus charges to intercept him...

Drew gets to the stairs first.

				GUS
		...cause you'll be dead!

WHAM! Gus brings the hammer down with the claw end leading. It 
sinks into the stair below Drew's feet...

Zowie LEAPS past Gus, tearing up the stairs as Gus wrenches the 
hammer free...

UPSTAIRS

Drew makes it to the top of the stairs with Zowie right on his 
heels.

Drew DIVES into Amanda and Gus' bedroom as...

Zowie springs from the floor. Drew SLAMS the door shut, SMACKING  
Zowie. Zowie collapses to the floor, dazed.

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

Drew throws the latch on the door. Almost immediately, Gus is 
outside, POUNDING at the door with the claw end of the hammer. 
Wood splinters fly as the hammer claw sinks through...

Drew SCREAMS and goes for one of the dormer windows. It's stuck; 
he can't get it open.

From the hallway, Gus violently SMASHES the door again and again. 
The door is splintering apart. WE SEE glimpses of Gus through the 
ragged holes.

				GUS (O.S.)
		Do you understand these rights,
		Drew buddy?!

Drew grabs a chair and HEAVES it through the window...

				GUS (O.S.)
		...OR ARE YOU JUST TOO FUCKING
		STUPID?!

The bedroom door EXPLODES INWARD and Gus claws his way into the 
room...

Wasting no time, Drew climbs through the broken window...

EXT.  DREW'S HOUSE - DAY

Drew slides down the slant of the roof. He hits the lattice and 
takes it to the ground with him.

Untangling himself, he gets to his feet...

...and here comes Amanda, ARRIVING HOME.

Drew runs for her car, waving his hands, throwing himself into her 
path so she'll go no further. She SLAMS on the brakes.

Drew pulls open the passenger door and dives inside...

				DREW
		Gus killed Clyde, Mom! He's
		trying to kill me!

Just then, the BACK DOOR flies open. Gus steps out.

				GUS
		Drew, buddy! Daddy's not done
		yet!

Amanda spots the hammer hanging from his grip. Gus cracks a sick 
smile and FLINGS THE HAMMER at the car...

CRACK! The hammer bounces off the windshield, causing it to 
spiderweb.

				DREW
		Go Mom! Go!!!

That's all the convincing Amanda needs. She puts the car into 
reverse and stomps on the gas...

INT.  CAR - DAY

Speeding down the highway. Drew and Amanda are mortified.

Suddenly, we hear the WAIL of Gus' patrol car coming up from 
behind. Amanda looks to the rear-view mirror...

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

Approaching from the road ahead is a POTATO TRUCK.

INT.  AMANDA'S CAR - DAY

Amanda hips her head back in front of them. The potato truck is 
blaring its HORN.

Gus' car swerves out onto the shoulder, speeding up to match her 
pace.

				DREW
		Mom!!!

Gus cranks the wheel, jumping back onto the road, forcing Amanda's 
car into the path of the oncoming truck.

INT.  POTATO TRUCK - DAY

THE DRIVER stands on the BRAKES.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY

THE POTATO TRUCK COLLIDES WITH AMANDA'S CAR. HEAD ON.

Thousands of potatoes explode from the rear of the truck, 
obscuring our view.

WE HEAR THE HORRIFYING SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING METAL. CRUNCHING BONES. 
AND SILENCED CRIES.

Gus' vehicle speeds past. WE HOLD on the mess of twisted steel. 
Clearly there are no survivors.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE - DUSK

Geoff enters first. Wearing a dark suit. Looking pale and empty 
inside. Chase follows, dressed in black. It's obvious they've been 
to a funeral.

Without a word, Geoff heads up the stairs. Chase watches on, 
feeling utterly helpless.

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Chase exits from his bedroom, pulling a sweater over a more casual 
change of clothes. He cocks his head at the SOUNDS of Geoff moving 
about in the attic above.

The door atop the attic stairway is barely ajar.

Chase wrinkles his brow, concerned. Turning away, he heads 
downstairs.

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

Marjorie is preparing dinner. Across the room, the kitchen TV is 
playing...

ON TELEVISION is the evening news. A photo of Drew and Amanda 
appears above the NEWSCASTER.

				NEWSCASTER
		... Friends and neighbors came to
		pay respects for Drew and Amanda
		Gilbert, who died in a head-on
		collision Saturday...

Chase enters the kitchen, eyes moving to the TV.

				MARJORIE
		Those poor people. I saw Gus this
		morning... he looked terrible.

Chase pulls his eyes away from the broadcast as Marjorie sets 
dinner on the table. Chase yells upstairs.

				CHASE
		Geoff, dinner's ready!
			(after no reply)
		Geoff?!

				GEOFF (O.S.)
		I'm not hungry.

Chase gives Marjorie an apologetic look and rises from the table.

Meanwhile, the news broadcast continues. A photo of Clyde appears 
on the screen.

				NEWSCASTER
		...in other news, the
		disappearance of a Ludlow youth
		remains a mystery. Clyde Parker
		was last seen on Saturday
		afternoon. His motorcycle was
		found off Highway 62...

150   OMITTED

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Chase pushes open the door. A spring coil pulls the CREAKING door 
closed behind him. One look at the attic and Chase turns pale...

A huge window at the far end of the room allows the moonlight to 
reach all corners of the spacious old attic...

All of Renee's belongings have been unpacked. The entire attic has 
been converted into a museum-like room, down to the last 
meticulous detail. A room in preparation for Renee's return.

Gauzy curtains billow out from some unseen draft. Pictures of 
Renee rest everywhere. Awards. Memorabilia...

GEOFF is seated before the brightly lit, three-way theatrical 
mirror, casually setting out Renee's make-up.

				CHASE
		Geoff... what are you doing?

There's an obsessive dementia in Geoff's gaze.

				GEOFF
		I'm getting things ready for Mom.

Chase sighs. Obviously the strain of Drew's funeral has proven too 
much for Geoff. He moves closer.

				CHASE
			(gently)
		Mom is dead, Geoff. You know
		that...

A creepy smile flickers across Geoff's face.

				GEOFF
		She doesn't have to be.

Chase freezes as a chill runs up his spine.

				CHASE
		What are you talking about?

				GEOFF
		I can bring her back. The same
		way Drew and me brought Zowie
		back...

At this, Chase is positively spooked.

				CHASE
		Geoff, this is crazy. Zowie
		didn't die.

				GEOFF
		He did. We buried him.
			(intense)
		There's a place out in the
		woods... if you bury something
		there, it comes back alive.

Chase stares at his son. This is insane. It must be.

Just then, the PHONE RINGS downstairs. Geoff continues to stare at 
his father.

				GEOFF
		We tried it on Zowie first. And
		then we did it again, when Zowie
		killed Gus. Drew didn't want Gus
		to be dead, so we brought him
		back, too...

It's too much for Chase. His mouth is hanging agape.

				MARJORIE (O.S.)
			(outside the attic
			door)
		Doctor Matthews, you've got a
		call. It's the caretaker at the
		funeral home. Something about
		your wife's grave...

Chase nods in private acknowledgement. He stares at Geoff as he 
backs away.

				CHASE
		Look, Geoff. Just... just relax,
		okay. I'm going to take this call
		and I'll be right back. Okay?

Geoff doesn't respond. Chase pulls open the door and leaves.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Chase is on the phone. The CALLER'S WORDS bring grave concern to 
Chase.

				CHASE
		What?! Christ, I'll be right
		there...

Chase hangs up, stunned. He turns to Marjorie, who's watching him 
with a concerned gaze.

				CHASE
			(hurried)
		Marjorie, I need you to stay late.
		Geoff is really upset and I have
		to take care of this. Don't let
		him leave the house, alright?

Chase is out the door before she has a chance to respond.

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Geoff is laying on his mother's bed, weeping. Tiger sits at the 
foot of the bed. Suddenly she wakens and HISSES.

From out of the darkness...

RENEE'S HAND

ENTERS FRAME, gently touching Geoff's side. And with its arrival, 
so comes her eerie LULLABY.

				RENEE
			(a whisper)
		I need you, Geoff...

GEOFF

slowly raises his head, bewildered. Renee's hand withdraws into 
the darkness. He reaches out for her, but she's gone. The LULLABY 
remains, beckoning from down the attic stairs.

The attic door slowly swings open of its own accord.

Geoff rises from the bed and follows.

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS FOYER - NIGHT

Geoff looks into the living room as he passes. Marjorie has fallen 
asleep on the sofa with the TV on.

155   OMITTED

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

The lullaby drifts from beyond the deadfall. The fog rolls inward, 
towards the distant burial ground. As Geoff moves towards the 
deadfall, the fog converges around him.

EXT.  THE BOG - NIGHT

The lure of Renee's lullaby pulls Geoff deeper into the woods. We 
hear the unearthly ANIMAL HOWL once more.

EXT.  PLEASANTVILLE CEMETERY - NIGHT

Chase's van pulls to a stop behind a maintenance vehicle.

Chase is greeted by the limping CARETAKER, who quickly leads him 
off across the rolling hillside.

				CARETAKER
		...sorry to disturb you, Doctor
		Matthews, but I thought you'd want
		to come have a look for yourself.
		It's the damndest thing...

AT RENEE'S GRAVE -

Chase stops cold, gazing at the ground before him in disbelief...

The grave is a gaping cavity. The casket has been unearthed. 
Renee's body is missing.

				CHASE
		Jesus...
			(uncomprehending)
		Gus did this?!

				CARETAKER
			(nodding)
		He stuck around after the funeral.
		Told me he had an order to exhume
		your wife. I didn't think much of
		it until I saw him drag the body
		out of the coffin...
			(shakes his head)
		He put your wife in his truck and
		drove off right through Amanda and
		Drew's headstones...

The caretaker points across the hillside...

TIRE TRACKS cut through the manicured grass, cutting a path of 
destruction right through the field of headstones and on through 
the fence.

				CARETAKER
		I swear, nothing this weird has
		happened since Louis Creed dug up
		his boy...
			(beat)
		You want me to notify the
		authorities?

Chase doesn't answer, he just storms past the caretaker.

INT.  VAN - NIGHT

The van is speeding down the dark, open highway. Chase is on the 
car phone, frantic, waiting as it RINGS. There's finally an 
answer...

				CHASE
		Doctor Yolander, this is Chase
		Matthews, we spoke the other
		day...

Yolander cuts him off.

				YOLANDER'S VOICE
			(bitter)
		You didn't leave town, did you.

INT.  YOLANDER'S HOUSE (INTERCUT)

Yolander sits in the darkness, a bottle of whiskey and a tumbler 
at his side. His "creatures" are all around him, eyes glowing with 
reflected moonlight. His voice is slurred. The voice of someone 
who's already damned.

				YOLANDER
		You sorry bastard. You stayed. I
		have nothing more to say to you,
		Matthews...

				CHASE'S VOICE
			(desperate)
		Look, just tell me one thing. Did
		I treat an animal that had been
		brought back to life? Did I?!

				YOLANDER
		What do you think?

INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT

Chase grips the carphone tightly, his knuckles white.

				YOLANDER (V.O.)
		Believe what you saw, Matthews.
		The dog was dead.

				CHASE
		My God...
			(mounting horror)
		...how is that possible? You have
		to help me, Doctor Yolander. I
		don't know what I'm dealing with
		here! They've dug up my wife...

				YOLANDER'S VOICE
			(cutting him off)
		I'm retired from my practice,
		Matthews. It's your practice now,
		and it's your problem.
			(beat)
		God help you...

				CHASE
			(screaming)
		Wait! Don't hang up!

But Yolander does. And now we hear the DIAL TONE.

				CHASE
		Shit!

Chase flings the carphone down, looking up as...

An approaching potato truck ZOOMS by. Blinding headlights. A 
BLARING HORN. Chase barely swerves out of the way.

Recovering from the scare, Chase reaches over and opens the glove 
compartment. He pulls out his gun and sets it on the seat next to 
him.

EXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND

Geoff climbs the stone steps, reaching the flattop meas. He stops 
short, looking over the clearing...

GUS

is standing in the center of the burial ground. He's HUMMING, 
mimicking Renee's feminine tone. Now he stops and slowly turns, 
regarding Geoff with dead eyes. He's holding a pickaxe and shovel 
at his side.

Gus looks to the ground at his side. Geoff follows his gaze...

A VISION OF RENEE'S GRAVE APPEARS -

Headstone. Manicured grass. Thriving flowers. As if it had been 
uprooted from her resting place at Pleasantville and set down 
right in the middle of the Micmac ground.

And now, the vision of Renee's grave fades away. In its place is a 
bundle of white: RENEE'S SHROUDED BODY.

Gus raises the pickaxe, offering it to Geoff.

				GUS
		You bury your own, Geoff.

Geoff slowly nods and approaches, seduced beyond reason.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Marjorie stirs on the couch, blinking her eyes open at the SOUND 
of a THUD upstairs. Otherwise, the house is dark and silent.

				MARJORIE
		Geoff?

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Marjorie starts up the long, dark flight of stairs to the attic. 
The thin night-shirt she's wearing does little to protect her from 
the sudden cold. She clutches herself, shivering.

				MARJORIE
		Geoff? You okay up there?

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Marjorie cautiously pushes open the door. Her concern for Geoff is 
forgotten as she beholds the Renee Hallow memorabilia.

She moves about Renee's unpacked belongings in bewildered 
reverence.

The gauzy curtains billow about Marjorie like ghosts. And then she 
glimpses something beyond the curtains...

A FIGURE

stands in the shadows, wearing the BEADED PEACH DRESS that 
Marjorie had admired earlier. For a moment we think it's Renee, 
but as Marjorie draws closer, we see that the dress has been 
fitted onto a dressmaker's model.

Marjorie lays a hand on the fabric, feeling the contours of the 
design.

EEXT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase's headlights sweep across the front of the dark house. 
Pulling to a stop, Chase opens the van's door...

ZOWIE

LEAPS out of the darkness, sinking his teeth into Chase's 
shoulder.

Chase is thrown back over the car seat, grappling with the 
nightmare dog as it tears into him again and again...

Chase SCREAMS, reaching back for the gun. He grabs hold of it and 
swings it around... FIRES...

Zowie is BLOWN backwards, clear out of the car, spraying CHASE 
with BLOOD...

Zowie lands outside on his feet, looking stunned. His chest is a 
ruined mess. Zowie WHIMPERS and drags himself weakly towards the 
front porch.

Chase stumbles out of the van, clutching the gun. He's bleeding 
profusely.

179   OMITTED

EXT.  PORCH - NIGHT

An old saw is laying in a pile of sawdust next to a square hole 
that's been cut in the base of the front door.

Chase gives it a look as he tries the door. It's unlocked. Chase 
enters, bringing with him an illuminating swath from his 
headlights.

INT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase's headlights stream through the windows, distorting the 
interior. The house looks like it's been through a tornado. A 
trail of BLOODY PAW PRINTS leads into the kitchen. The stench is 
repulsive. Grimacing, Chase has to keep himself from gagging.

				CHASE
		Jesus...

As Chase moves forward, he catches sight of...

GUS

standing in a swath of light. At Gus' feet is Zowie, tongue 
lolling out of his mouth. Dead for the second time. Scattered 
around the dog are various tools.

Propped against the wall is the cut out square of wood. It's 
fitted with hinges at the top.

				CHASE
		Gus, what are you doing?!

Gus glances down at the dead dog.

				GUS
			(dead-pan)
		I was building a doggy door.

				CHASE
		God damn it Gus, you dug up my
		wife! What the fuck is going on
		around here?!

Gus brings a cordless electric drill up from his side, pointing it 
at Chase in a threatening manner.

				GUS
			(grins)
		A little drilling. A little
		killing.

As Gus moves forward, Chase gets a good look at him for the first 
time. He doesn't look even remotely alive.

				CHASE
		Holy shit!

Chase levels his gun with a trembling hand.

Gus stabs the air with the drill, feeding on Chase's horror.

Chase pulls the trigger. A bullet pounds Gus' chest. A SPRAY OF 
FLESH explodes from his back.

Unphased, Gus regains his balance.

				GUS
		God I hate when that happens...

Before Chase can squeeze off the next round, Gus rips the gun from 
his grip...

				GUS
		You got a permit for that?

Opening the chamber, Gus empties the remaining bullets and tosses 
the gun aside.

				GUS
		Didn't think so.

Gus fires up the drill. The bit spinZZZZZZ. He DIVES at Chase, 
knocking him back against the counter. The drill bit SINKS INTO 
CHASE'S ARM...

Chase SCREAMS as Gus withdraws it. Now, he presses it into Chase's 
shoulder. Chase is on the verge of blacking out now. The pain is 
unbearable...

Gus withdraws the drill once again, aiming now for Chase's eye.

				GUS
			(maniacal)
		No brain, no pain, Chase. Think
		about it...

The whirling drill bit is millimeters away from Chase's eye. He 
clutches Gus' arm, trying to force the drill aside...

At the last second, adrenaline kicks in and Chase diverts the 
drill. It SINKS INTO the counter-top nearby... STUCK.

Gus ROARS, lashing out, but Chase manages to duck away...

Chase catches sight of HIS GUN on the floor. He scrambles for it, 
scooping it up...

BULLETS are rolling across the floor every which way. Chase slaps 
his palm down on one and desperately fumbles with the chamber...

Gus' hands CLAMP DOWN around Chase's neck. He swings Chase around 
and SLAMS him against the wall, lifting him off his feet...

Chase GASPS as the life is literally crushed out of him...

He brings the gun up beneath Gus' chin and jams it into his ruined 
throat. Gus just keeps on throttling him...

				GUS
			(insane)
		Just remember, Chase... I had Renee
		first... and now I'm gonna have her
		last...

BLAM! The top of Gus' head BLOWS off. His BODY is thrown back by 
the incredible force, tumbling him to the kitchen floor with a 
HEAVY THUD.

Chase sucks in precious air, then his head snaps up.

				CHASE
		Geoff!

EXT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase stumbles from the house. It's a wonder he's even conscious. 
He swings open the van door and throws himself inside, sinking the 
key into the ignition.

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Marjorie is now seated before Renee's theatrical make-up mirror, 
entranced. She's wearing the beaded peach dress.

With the help of Renee's vast array of cosmetics, Marjorie has 
turned herself into a stunning beauty.

The lipstick isn't quite right. Turning to the countertop 
magnifying mirror, she carefully touches up her ruby red lips. Her 
face fills nearly the entire mirror...

...except for one rim, which reflects the dark, shadowy attic 
behind her.

A HUGE EYE joins her reflection in the distorting mirror. Marjorie 
nearly jumps out of her skin. She spins around...

				MARJORIE
		Jesus, Geoff! Don't sneak up on
		me like that!

...but no one is there.

THE MAKE-UP MIRROR catches another glimpse. Renee's RED LIPS, 
magnified tenfold. The lips begin to move...

				RENEE
			(a whisper)
		Did you really think you could be
		like me?

Renee's fist swings in, SMASHING a panel of the mirror...

Marjorie raises her hands to protect herself against the flying 
glass. And as her hands come down, she finds...

Renee standing before her. Her ghostly form silhouetted by 
moonlight. Curtains billowing around her. We never fully see her.

Marjorie's face goes white with fear.

				RENEE
		Such a young face... but you've got
		potential...

Renee grabs a fistful of Marjorie's hair, viciously YANKING her 
head back...

				RENEE
		We'll do the eyes first. You
		always start with the eyes...

Renee lashes out, SLASHING a mirror shard across the skin beneath 
Marjorie's right eye. Marjorie SCREAMS.

INT.  GEOFF'S ROOM - NIGHT

Geoff awakens at the commotion upstairs. He rocks forward, rising 
from his bed.

185   OMITTED

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

Geoff pauses at the base of the attic stairway, looking up at the 
open door. All he hears are the faint SOUNDS of movement.

				GEOFF
		Marjorie? You know you're not
		supposed to be in the attic.

Geoff starts up the stairs.

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Geoff trepidatiously enters. He weaves through the maze of gauzy 
curtains. And then he sees her...

Renee is standing in the midst of the attic. She's perfectly made 
up. Gorgeous. Just as she was on the day she died. She smiles 
warmly.

				GEOFF
		Mom...

				RENEE
		I came back for you, Geoff. We're
		going to be together again.

Renee raises her outstretched arms to receive him. Through the 
haze of his tears, Geoff doesn't see the sinister, vacant gleam in 
her eyes.

INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT

Reaching the house, Chase SKIDS to a stop across the lawn.

188B  OMITTED

INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT

Chase cautiously enters with the gun in his grasp. The spring coil 
swings the CREAKING door shut behind him.

From Chase's vantage point, he can't see them yet. He makes his 
way around the stripped dressmaker's model, past an upright 
dressing mirror. And then he sees...

MARJORIE

Slumped against Renee's bed like a ragdoll. We can only see half 
of her face. It looks untouched. Chase reaches for her...

				CHASE
		Marjorie?

Marjorie's head rolls sideways, exposing the other half of her 
face. The skin has been stripped from her skull and peeled back...

Chase turns his head away. And that's when he sees them...

RENEE AND GEOFF

Holding each other tightly. Geoff has his head buried in Renee's 
breast. Renee looks up from her son, meeting Chase's gaze. Her 
voice is both seductive and terrifying.

				RENEE
		Hello, Chase.

Chase gasps. The word "horror" doesn't do the moment justice.

				CHASE
		Oh my God...

				RENEE
		We can try again, Chase. We can
		make it work this time.

Chase sinks back against the wall. He's lost a lot of blood and 
his strength is leaving him.

				CHASE
			(shaking his head)
		No...

				RENEE
		Don't you love me anymore, Chase?

				CHASE
		You're not Renee... Renee's dead...
			(screaming)
		Geoff! Get over here now!

But Geoff just holds his mother tighter. A hint of annoyance 
flickers through Renee's eyes. She strokes Geoff's hair.

				RENEE
			(looking at Chase)
		Geoff, honey, why don't you go
		downstairs. Your father and I
		need a moment alone. Do it for
		me?

Geoff looks up at his mother, mesmerized. She releases him from 
the embrace. He brushes past Chase without a glance and heads for 
the attic door.

				RENEE
		Geoff...

Geoff pauses at the door, looking back. Renee's words have a 
hauntingly familiar ring...

				RENEE
		I love you.

Geoff smiles. Turning away, he opens the door and...

CLYDE

is standing there, an AXE perched on his shoulder. His face is 
torn to shit, bones and brain matter exposed. He's covered from 
head to toe in dirt and clotted blood. He looks worse than any of 
the undead we've seen. A total walking nightmare.

				CLYDE
			(grinning)
		Hey, Junior. Wanna play?

WHOOSH! Clyde swings the axe, sinking it into the wall just in 
front of Geoff's face...

Geoff tumbles back onto the floor, snapping out of his trance.

Clyde brings the axe down...

...and Geoff rolls to the side, barely avoiding decapitation.

				CHASE
		Geoff!

Chase stumbles forward to rescue his son. As he does so, Clyde 
brings the axe back up, SMASHING Chase in the head with the blunt 
end...

Chase goes down. Unconscious.

				CLYDE
		Oops! Looks like Daddy got a boo-
		boo...

Clyde turns his gaze back on Geoff.

				CLYDE
		Now, where were we?

Geoff shuffles backwards across the floor as Clyde moves into the 
room.

Renee passes behind Clyde. She SLAMS the attic door shut and snaps 
off the knob with a jerk of the wrist, locking them all inside.

Scared out of his wits, Geoff makes it to his feet. Clyde swings 
again and misses...

Geoff grabs hold of the axe handle, struggling, and the two boys 
go down...

RENEE

Moves to the vanity. She sweeps a hand across it, sending 
everything crashing to the ground. Crystal perfume bottles 
SHATTER, spilling their contents over the floor.

Renee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on. She touches the 
flame to the perfume-soaked floor...

FLAMES roar into existence, racing across the floorboards, 
igniting the curtains...

We see the flames reflected in Renee's soulless eyes.

ON GEOFF AND CLYDE

As they wrestle with one another across the floor. Bloody spittle 
drips from Clyde's face. He flashes a feral snarl.

Clyde LUNGES forward and tears into Geoff's shoulder with his 
teeth...

Geoff SCREAMS. His hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a 
mirror shard. He JABS it up and into Clyde's eye...

Somehow, Geoff manages to roll out from under Clyde. He rises to 
his feet...

Clyde lets loose a DEMONIC ROAR. He charges, SLASHING the axe 
wildly, knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike. 
Nothing's going to stop him. Nothing.

Flames are consuming the attic, licking the rafters, igniting the 
canopy drapings... devouring everything. SMOKE is rolling across 
the floor...

Geoff reaches a far wall. He's trapped in a corner. There's 
nowhere else to go. Behind Geoff is a CIRCUIT BOX. INSULATED 
CABLES run from the box down through the attic floor. Geoff 
turns...

And here comes Clyde...

				CLYDE
		Here it comes, buddy! HERE IT
		FUCKING COMES!!!

Clyde swings. Geoff ducks. The axe hits the circuit box behind 
him, severing the insulated cables...

As Clyde rips the axe out of the wall for another try, Geoff 
reaches for one of the SPARKING CABLES.

Clyde raises the axe above his head...

				CLYDE
		Eat it, ass-hole...

				GEOFF
		EAT THIS!!!

...and Geoff shoves the live cable into Clyde's mouth!

SPARKS shoot out of Clyde's eyes and ears. He jerks back and 
forth, writhing in a horrific replay of Renee's electrocution.

Then Clyde's face BLOWS APART in a gout of ruined flesh and BLUE 
FLAME. The circuit is blown and the SMOKING BODY falls...

Geoff drops the cable. The blazing inferno is closing in. He runs 
to Chase...

Chase is barely conscious. Geoff drops to his knees and pulls his 
father to his feet...

				RENEE (O.S.)
		Don't leave me again, Geoff!

Geoff turns...

RENEE

is standing in the midst of the FLAMES, reaching out. The make-up 
and mortician's wax she wears fall victim to the heat and her 
"face" begins to MELT AWAY...

				RENEE
		Don't leave me alone!

Geoff turns away, horrified. With Chase on his shoulder, he 
reaches the door. Locked. Geoff sets Chase against the wall.

He spots the AXE, still clutched in Clyde's hand. Geoff drags the 
axe free from the dead boy's grasp and goes to work on the door...

Ignoring Renee's CRIES, Geoff swings the axe again and again, 
chopping the door apart. He coughs through the smoke. The flames 
are almost upon them...

Finally, the wood splinters apart. Geoff reaches through and 
grasps the outside handle, pulling the door open. Then he turns 
and lifts Chase up once more...

At the door, Geoff pauses for one final, tearful look back. Then 
his face hardens and he turns away, pulling Chase to safety.

				RENEE
		NO, GEOFF! NO!!!

ON RENEE

Alone in the fiery storm, SCREAMING. Flames devour her flowing 
white dress. Her face doesn't even look remotely human anymore.

And as the inferno slowly closes in, we...

								DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  VETERINARY OFFICE - DAY

We PULL OUT from a sign on the door that says "CLOSED".

Chase is just now locking up the door. He's bandaged up, looking a 
little worse for the wear, but happy to be alive. He turns, 
grinning...

GEOFF

stands near the van, holding Tiger in his arms.

				GEOFF
		All set?

				CHASE
		All set.

Chase joins Geoff at the van and together they climb inside. Chase 
starts the engine, pulling away from the office.

WE STAY ON THE VAN -

As it moves off down the street, passing the familiar landmarks of 
sleepy Ludlow.

RISING UP -

We follow the van as it sweeps out of town. Ludlow looks picture-
perfect from our bird's eye vantage point. Charming and quiet.

				CHASE (V.O.)
		So where're we going?

				GEOFF
		Anywhere but here.

We continue rising up into the brilliant blue sky, losing the van 
amidst the rolling Maine countryside and we

								DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  MICMAC FOREST - DAY

RUSHING over the woods, just above the tree tops. It's an ocean of 
swaying green beneath us. A forest as ancient and mysterious as 
anything on the Earth.

AND SUDDENLY -

The endless trees fall out from under us. We find ourselves above 
the flattop mesa of the Micmac burial ground, swooping downward...

The ground surges towards us. We see Renee's OPEN GRAVE.

The quality of light is different now. We hear the wail of the 
LONESOME WIND, and perhaps, the WHISPER of something altogether 
alien.

And on the unsettling note, we...

								FADE TO BLACK.

                                             3/3/98








     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS
     AND SOME "OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS
     SOFT COPY.

     NOTE ALSO: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT WAS IN THE NON-
     PREFORMAT FONT "TIMES NEW ROMAN". THIS HAS BEEN CHANGED
     TO PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY.









Though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in PITCH BLACK are 
seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are 
felt. They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling 
coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life
when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake 
hits. Chimera of the night. The point is made so the reader appreciates
that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, 
but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters. 
For PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and 
lack of the same.

     CUT IN:

     INT. MAIN CABIN

     A CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN, spitting out...

     CAROLYN FRY. She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew
     lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. But the
     deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere:
     The world is dying around her.

     Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the
     next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE
     is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But
     in the next cryo-locked...

     The CAPTAIN is struggling awake. Fry's face floods with relief.
     Slapping an intercom:

                              FRY
               Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to
               the hull...holding for now, but...Goddamn,
               I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your
               E-release...no, red handle, red handle.
               I'll get the warm-ups out while --

     PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT: Particles bore through the cabin,
     blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING
     INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS
     HISSING in the air.

     Fry lands on her ass, horrified. Suddenly...

     Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right on top of Fry --
     but this one's still alive. Disoriented, frantic:

                              OWENS
               Why did I fall on you?

                              FRY
               He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was
               looking right at him when --

                              OWENS
               I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22
               weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to
               kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean,
               I mean, why did I fall at all?

                              FRY
               You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.

                              OWENS
               Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai',
               wait. I'm Owens. Right?

     They swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure of their own
     identities.

                              FRY
               Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs
               brain cells.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

     They stumble into nav-bay. ALARMS CONTINUE. Fry grabs warm-up
     suits out of storage, pitches one to Owens, checks her screens.

                              FRY
               1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute,
               shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin'
               took a swipe at us.

                              OWENS
               Just tell me we're still in the shipping
               lane. Just show me all those stars, all
               those bright, beautiful, deep-space....

     Owens activates an exterior view: A planet rushes up at us.
     That's why they have gravity.

                              FRY
               Jesus God....


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     The SHIP PLOWS through the upper atmosphere, antennae pylons
     already disintegrating.


     INT. PASSAGE TO FLIGHT DECK

     Heart battering her ribs, Fry runs forward, using hand-holds to
     steady herself. Over a headset:

                              OWENS (V.O.)
               They trained you for this, right? Fry?
               FRY?

     She doesn't answer.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Fry harnesses in, starts running switches -- but fumbles a few
     times, making mental errors. Finally she gets crash-shutters
     open to reveal...

     CLOUD STRATA sweeping up past the windscreen like floor-lights
     on a dropping elevator. We're shedding big altitude.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

                              OWENS
               ... crisis program selected Number Two of
               this system because it shows at least some
               oxygen and more than 1,500 -- would you
               SHUT THE FUCK UP!
                         (hammers a button,
                          SILENCES ALARMS)
               -- more than 1,500-millibars of pressure
               at surface-level. Okay, so maybe the ship
               did something right for a change....


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     As Fry runs more switches.


     INT. SHIP - DAY

     As JETTISON DOORS CLOSE around the ship.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     As Fry flips up a security-latch -- and thumbs the switch below.


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     MULTIPLE SHOTS: EXPLOSIVE BOLTS RAPID-FIRE around the ship's
     skin, blowing away non-essentials that hinder aerodynamics --
     including big deep-space drives. But this last separation puts
     the ship into a dangerous roll.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Out the windscreen, cloud strata roll vertiginously. Fry throws
     actuators...


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     And airbrakes deploy. She manages to kill the roll. But the
     ship's still coming in nose-high.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

                              OWENS
               ...showing no major water bodies...maximum
               terrain, 220 meters over mean surface...
               largely cinder and gypsum with some
               evaporite deposits....

     JETTISON DOORS CLOSE behind Owens, segregating him from the
     passenger compartment. It scares him for a new reason.

                              OWENS
               Fry? What're you doing?


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Fry flips up a new security-latch. INTERCUTTING:

                              OWENS
               Fry?

                              FRY
               Can't get my nose down...too much load
               back there....

                              OWENS
               You mean that "load" of passengers?

                              FRY
               So what, we should both go down too?
               Out of sheer fucking nobility?

     Tortured silence. Fry's thumb moves to the switch that will
     jettison the passenger cabin. Jettison 50 people.


     INT. MAIN CABIN

     SELECTED SHOTS of faces inside cryo-lockers, among them JOHNS.
     He's prime-of-life, badge on display, some kind of cop. Shaken
     awake, he clears condensation to check the locker directly across
     from his, finding...

     RIDDICK. Small black goggles hide his eyes. A metal bit wedged
     in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace. A read-out admonishes
     "LOCK-OUT PROTOCOL IN EFFECT. ABSOLUTELY NO EARLY
     RELEASE."


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

                              OWENS
               Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible
               for every one of those --

                              FRY
               Company's not here, is it?

                              OWENS
               When captain went down, you stepped up --
               whether you like it or not. Now they
               train you for this, so --

                              FRY
               And there wasn't a simulated cockroach
               alive within 50 clicks of the simulated
               crash site! That's how they train you!
               On a fucking simulator!

     Owens unbuckles from his chair.

                              OWENS
               Don't touch that switch!

     Overcome by guilt, Fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction.
     But a HUGE JOLT puts the thumb right back.

                              FRY
               I'm not dying for them.

     She pushes it. But this time...


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     No bolts fire. Nothing separates from the SHIP THAT SCREAMS DOWN
     through the clouds.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

     Now we see why: Owens reopened the jettison doors locally -- and
     blocked them open.

                              FRY
               Owens!

                              OWENS
               70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to
               level this beast out!


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Seething anger and guilt, Fry pops more airbrakes, shedding more
     speed, more heat. The ship does level -- but it's still being
     pounded hellishly. She tries to get a stable view out...

     The windscreen. We're breaking through cloud-bottoms. There's
     just a glimpse of landscape before...


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     An airbrake fails. It shears off and pinwheels into...


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     The windscreen. It cracks into a thousand spiderwebs -- but
     impossibly it holds. For now.

                              OWENS (V.O.)
               What the shit was that?

     Sunlight flares from every fractured edge: It's like looking
     into burning diamonds, and Fry can only get an impression
     of the outside world. Now she has to rely on...

     A ground-mapping display. 120 meters altitude. And dropping.


     INT. CRYO-LOCKER - DAY

     INTERCUT Johns. Realizing he's in some kind of shit-storm, he
     claws at safety restraints.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Ground-mapper: 60 meters. COLLISION ALARMS kick in.

     Out the fractured windscreen, we see a huge dark mass rise up
     into view. Land.

     40 meters...30...20...10....

     Fry braces.

     IMPACT. The WINDSCREENS IMPLODE. AIR HURRICANES in.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

     IMPACT. Chairs rip from their moorings. Strapped into one,
     Owens slams into the ceiling.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - DAY

     IMPACT. Johns BLOWS OUT of his locker -- and wishes to God he
     would've stayed inside, because just beside him...

     The hull is cracking open.

     NIGHTMARE SHOT: A huge section of the cabin tears free...
     skitters and CRASHES along the planetfloor behind us...and
     disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it.
     40 lives.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Hammered by WIND, Fry opens her eyes experimentally.

     FRY'S POV: A vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris.
     But the ship is burrowing in. Burrowing under.

     Fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before...
     Dirt avalanches into the cockpit. It buries CAMERA.

                                                       BLACKOUT


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Choking yellow dust. Ghostly silhouettes are COUGHING, MOANING,
     CALLING OUT to other survivors in English and, surreally, in
     Arabic. Soon we find...

     Johns. Ears running blood. Stumbling his way to...

     Riddick's cryo-locker. Empty. Johns reaches for his holster.
     Gone, torn right off his belt. No prisoner and no weapon --
     spooky combination. Nearby he sees...

     The light of a cutting torch. Someone's using it to open a
     jammed cryo-locker. The plexi is torched away to reveal...

     AUDREY, 12 years old. Unscathed.

                              AUDREY
               Somethin' went wrong, huh?

     Johns searches for his pistol. Behind him, two chained feet
     lower into FRAME -- and then attack, swinging over Johns' head...
     getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as
     a choke-collar. Johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at...

     Riddick. Still in body chains and mouth-bit. Clinging to a
     ceiling support. Riding out the baton blows.

     Seconds from blacking out, Johns strains forward...forward...and
     finally breaks Riddick's grip on the support. He keeps hold of
     the chained feet so that...

     Riddick SLAMS HEADFIRST into the deck. Johns lays the baton on
     his neck.

                              JOHNS
               One chance and you blew it, Riddick.
               Never cease to disappoint me.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Darkness. A light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit.
     It's packed with dirt, no signs of life. About to search
     elsewhere, Johns turns back at...

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Hey.

                              JOHNS
               Hey, who?

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Hey, me. Over here.

     His light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt. Johns
     crawls closer, checks the other side of the headrest and finds
     her. Fry. Buried to the gills.

                              JOHNS
               Amazing. I'm Johns.

                              FRY
               Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...

     He manages a smile and starts digging her out. Almost dreading
     to ask:

                              FRY
               Are there any others, Johns?


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Johns helps Fry through the carnage. She's stunned by it all --
     but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be.

     Realizing she's in nav-bay, Fry starts digging like a search dog
     to uncover...

     Owens. Still strapped to his chair. Metal rod piercing his
     chest close to the heart. Dead. Fry reaches out to touch him.

                              OWENS
               Out, out, out, GET IT OUTTA ME!

     She recoils hard. He's still alive. The other survivors bungle
     over. Ten seconds of pure chaos:

                              VOICES
               Pull it out of him...No, it's too close to
               the heart...You gotta do it, just do it
               fast....

     Fry grabs the rod.

                              OWENS
               Don't touch it! Don't touch that switch!

                              VOICES
               You'll kill him, I'm tellin' you, shit,
               just leave it alone...delirious...doncha
               you got some drugs for this poor man....

                              OWENS
               Don't touch that switch!

                              FRY
               Awright, awright, someone...there's
               Anestaphine in the med-lock, that end of
               the cabin...next to....

     But there is no more "that end." In exquisite pain, Owens
     screams on. REACTION SHOTS of Johns, Audrey. Seldom are human
     beings witness to such raw suffering.

                              FRY
               Get away. Everybody.

     The others leave -- except for Audrey, staying behind to watch
     in morbid fascination. Johns doubles back and collars her.
     Leaving, they pass...

     Riddick, cuffed to a bulkhead. His eyes, still hidden by
     goggles, track Johns and Audrey toward daylight.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     The survivors straggle outside. CAMERA SURVEYS new faces:

     ZEKE and SHAZZA. Male-female team of bushwhackers, partners in
     life. Shazza has a tough sexiness. Zeke's face shows aboriginal
     blood. (30s.)

     PARIS. Overfed, overgroomed. A puff pastry of a man. (40s or
     50s.)

     Four male "Chrislams": The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish), and
     THREE PILGRIMS, young and excitable (late-teens). (NOTE: The
     Chrislams represent a union between Christianity and Islam. They
     have the iconography of Christians yet the physical look of Arab
     Muslims.)

     WIDE SHOT: All around them is stark and unforgiving terrain.
     The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side,
     spiked with earthen spires. Scorching down on everything are
     two suns -- one red, one yellow.

                              PARIS
               Well. Our own little slice of heaven.

     The Chrislams fall to their knees. Confusion as they try to
     orient themselves.

                              IMAM
               Please...which way to New Mecca? We must
               know the direction in order to pray.

     North? South? East? West? Nobody knows. Johns snaps open a
     compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly. The SCREAMING
     inside the ship finally ends.


     INT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     As Fry holds Owens, now dead.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     The four Chrislams have devised a way to pray: Backs together,
     each faces a different compass point.


     EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Fry climbs onto the back of the ship. Johns Paris, Zeke, Shazza,
     Audrey are already here.

                              JOHNS
               Big talk about a scouting party...

     Fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship.
     One glance confirms that there are no other survivors.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               ...then we saw this.

                              PARIS
               Anyone else having breathing problems?
               Aside from me?

                              AUDREY
               Like I just ran, or something....

                              SHAZZA
               Feel one lung short. All of us.

                              PARIS
               Well, I tend toward the asthmatic. And
               with all this dust....

     Faces turn to Fry: They're looking to her for answers.

                              FRY
               It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure,
               not enough oxygen. Might take a few days
               to --

                              ZEKE
               So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?

                              FRY
               Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a
               rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.

                              SHAZZA
               Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking
               grateful. This beast wasn't made to land
               like this. But cripes, you rode it down.
                         (to others)
               C'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason
               we're alive is a'cuzza her.

     Others CHIME AGREEMENT, laying thankful hands on Fry's shoulders.
     HOLD on Fry, her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their
     savior.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Breaking out pressure suits:

                              FRY
               Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start
               ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try
               to make it last.

                              AUDREY
               Well, is someone coming for us? Or are
               we all just gonna die of exposure or
               dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even
               something worse?
                         (off their looks)
               Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring
               me.

                              SHAZZA
               We're worried you'll scare us.
                         (ushering her away)
               Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're
               goin' to Taurus Three like we were?

                              AUDREY
               Yeah, but...do we even have enough food
               to get there? Or will we have to resort
               to cannibalism?

                              ZEKE
                         (to Fry)
               I'll see 'bout makin' this air go a bit
               further, cap'n. With your permission,
               a' course.

     Fry blinks. "They actually think I'm the captain." Zeke and the
     others get to work. Fry finds herself staring at another
     problem. Riddick.

                              FRY
               And him?

                              JOHNS
               Big Evil?

                              FRY
               We just keep him locked up forever?

                              JOHNS
               Be my choice. Already escaped once from
               the max-slam facility on --

                              FRY
               I don't need his life story. Is he really
               that dangerous?

                              JOHNS
               Only around humans.

     Riddick has his mouth on the hull, virtually licking the metal.
     Fry moves closer -- and now sees it sheeting down the hull.

                              FRY
               Oh, Christ....

     They're losing water. Suddenly Fry is running, snatching up an
     emergency light, climbing wall-rungs...


     INT. MACHINE LEVEL - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     And crawling through dusty superstructure to reach the water
     cistern. She opens a crank-hatch -- and finds light invading the
     interior. Her face dies.

                              ZEKE (V.O.)
                         (shouting)
               Well? Is it just the pump?

                              FRY
               Ask if anyone has anything in cargo!
               Anything to drink!


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     Oversize DOORS RUMBLE open. Fry, Johns, and Paris climb into
     this dark corridor lined with cargo containers. Each container
     has an access door.

                              PARIS
               Mine here....

     As Paris unlocks, Johns steadies himself, suddenly light-headed.

                              FRY
               S'matter?

                              JOHNS
               Little swamp-flu from the Conga system.
               Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.

     Paris opens his container to reveal...


     INT. PARIS' CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - DAY

     Tiffany chairs stacked 10 high. Bronze eagle lecterns. Oriental
     umbrellas. Neo-Egyptian castings.

                              JOHNS
               King Tut's tomb....

                              PARIS
               Be surprised what these will fetch in the
               Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here --
               easy, easy. Very rare.

     They open the Wooten desk. Cubbyholed inside are dusty bottles
     of sherry. Vintage Port. Glenfiddich. Bicardi 151.

                              FRY
               This is it? Booze? That's what you have
               to drink?

                              PARIS
                         (educating her)
               200-year-old single-malt scotch is to
               "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."

                              JOHNS
                         (cracking a bottle)
               A toast to whatever he just said.

                              PARIS
               I'll need a receipt for that.
                         (to Fry)
               For all these.

                              FRY
               Top of my list.

     She joins Johns for a drink. Entering, the Chrislams watch with
     both envy and aversion.

                              FRY
               I don't suppose....

                              IMAM
               One of the Christian habits we didn't
               adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll
               have to wait.

                              JOHNS
               For what? There is no water. You
               understand that, don't you?

                              IMAM
               All deserts have water, somewhere. God
               shall lead us there.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     START on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage. Staring at it
     is...

     Riddick. With his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead,
     he can't get near it. Or can he? Near the ceiling, the bulkhead
     is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through.

     Riddick stands. With a GRUESOME POPPING, he dislocates both
     shoulders...carries his arms overhead...passes the chains through
     the broken spot...and brings his arms down in front of him. A
     body-flex POPS HIS SHOULDERS back into joint.

     Free, he reaches for the cutting torch.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Pistol in hand, Johns runs into a BIG CLOSEUP, eyes sweeping.
     Nothing on the horizon. But something lies on the ground nearby.
     It's Riddick's mouth-bit.

                              JOHNS
               Like we needed another way to die.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     FAST CLOSEUPS: Hands pillaging storage lockers, pulling out
     anything that might qualify as a "weapon." It all gets hauled
     back and dumped into...

     INT. NAV BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Nav-bay. Gathered, the survivors take inventory: Johns has a
     pistol, shotgun, baton. Zeke and Shazza offer up a pick-ax,
     digging tools, hunting boomerang. Imam shows a ceremonial blade.
     Paris straggles in with antique curios.

                              JOHNS
               What the hell are these?

                              PARIS
               Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern
               India. Very rare.

                              ZEKE
               An' this?

                              PARIS
               Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New
               Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe's
               extinct.

                              ZEKE
               'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these
               things, be my guess.

                              PARIS
               Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's
               gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?

                              JOHNS
               First, because he can only live out there
               for so long -- he's gonna come back and
               take what we got. Second, for the sheer
               thrill of the kill.

     A beat. They all grab for weapons.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Johns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope. He
     fixates on...

     A blue glow on the horizon. "What the hell is it?"

     Zeke and Shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing
     and ball-floats. The prototype is tested on Audrey. She sucks
     on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on
     demand rather than in a constant flow.

     Chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear, readying for
     travel.

     Fry finishes wrapping Owens' body. She looks to the yellow sun,
     low on the horizon. The red sun seems inclined to follow.

                              FRY
               Imam. We should leave soon. Before
               nightfall but while it's cooler.

                              ZEKE
               What, you're goin' off, too?

                              FRY
               Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a
               favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They
               were good guys who died bad.

                              SHAZZA
               A'course we will.

                              PILGRIM #1 (O.S.)
               Imam...Imam....

     (NOTE: "Imam" is pronounced "el-ee-MAM.")

     Fry and the others round the ship to see...

     A blue star flaring into view. It's rising as the other suns are
     setting.

                              SHAZZA
               My bloody oath....

                              AUDREY
               Three suns?

                              ZEKE
                         (to Fry)
               So much for your nightfall.

                              PARIS
               So much for my cocktail hour.

                              IMAM
               We take this to be a good sign -- a path,
               a direction from God.

     Johns swings down from the top of the ship.

                              JOHNS
               A very good sign.
                         (re: blue sun)
               That's Riddick's direction. You do not
               wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.

                              FRY
               Thought you found his restraints over
               there. Toward sunset.

                              JOHNS
                         (nodding)
               Which means he went toward sunrise.


     EXT. PLANET - DAY

     Trekking, the Chrislams waft incense pots and CHANT FROM
     THE KORAN as they head toward the blue star. Johns provides
     shotgun escort; Fry carries Paris' second war-pick on a shoulder.
     Silhouetted against the alien sky, the scouting party is an odd,
     odd sight.

     Already sun-battered, Johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi.
     Fry tries to wrap her head like the Chrislams. Imam helps.

                              FRY
               So quiet. You get used to the sounds of
               the ship, then....

                              IMAM
               You know who Muhammad was?

                              FRY
               Some prophet guy?

                              IMAM
               "Some prophet guy." And a city man. But
               he had to travel to the desert -- where
               there was quiet -- to hear the words of
               God.

                              FRY
               You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?

                              IMAM
                         (nodding)
               Chrislam teaches that once in every
               lifetime should there be a great hajj --
               a great pilgrimage. To know God, better,
               yes, but to know yourself as well.

                              FRY
               Frightening thought.

                              IMAM
                         (finishes wrapping her)
               We're all on the same hajj now.

     Fry notices Johns scope-locked on something.

                              FRY
               What?

                              JOHNS
                         (hands her scope)
               Tell me it's not a mirage.

     SCOPE POV: Beyond a distant rise, strange branches.

                              FRY
               Trees?


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Paris has taken over as look-out atop the ship. He deals with
     the heat by erecting a "misting" umbrella: He fills a reservoir
     with liquor, dials up a regulator. Umbrella spars shoot bursts
     of cooling alcohol vapor. Paris luxuriates in it.

                              ZEKE (O.S.)
               Comfy up there?

     Zeke appears below. He loads a scrap-metal sled with tarp,
     cable, pick-ax.

                              PARIS
               Amazing how you can do without the
               essentials of life -- so long as you have
               the luxuries.

                              ZEKE
               Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes
               open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up
               on me bloody-fuckin' arse.

     He drags the sled toward the spired hills. Keeping one eye on
     Zeke, Paris eases into a chair, lays the war-pick across his lap,
     pours himself a spot of sherry. As he sips, a blade touches his
     throat.

                              AUDREY
               He'd probably get you right here, right
               under the jaw. And you'd never hear him
               coming. That's how good Riddick is.

     Paris eases the hunting boomerang away.

                              PARIS
               Now did you run away from your parents?
               Or did they run away from you?

     EXT. BONEYARD OVERLOOK - DAY

     The scouting party approaches a rise. The trees loom just beyond.

                              PILGRIMS
               Allahu Akbar...Allahu Akbar....

     The young pilgrims break into a excited run, anticipating an
     oasis. But Fry hangs back, taking a harder look at the trees.
     They don't move in the wind.

     The pilgrims scramble up the rise -- and go motionless. Fry,
     Johns and Imam catch up to behold...

     The "trees" are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton,
     tinted green by lichen. Beyond is a sea of bleached animal
     bones. Impossibly, the bones seem to MOAN IN PAIN. All told,
     it's like Hell overflowed right here.

                              FRY
               Is this whole planet dead?

     A pilgrim questions Imam IN ARABIC.

                              IMAM
               He asks what could have killed so many
               great things...
         

     EXT. BONEYARD - DAY

     Moving into the boneyard:

                              IMAM
               Some...communal graveyard, perhaps...
               like the elephants of Earth....

     Fry touches one of the towering bones. It shows cut-marks --
     almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword. "Graveyard? Or
     killing field?"

                              JOHNS
               Long time ago. Whatever happened.


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Pilgrim #1 reaches a huge skull laced with baleen-like combing.
     Wind hitting the comb makes a LOW HARMONIC MOANING. By
     moving a hand over the comb, the pilgrim can "play" DIRGELIKE
     MUSIC. Wanting to show off the trick:

                              PILGRIM #1
               Ah....

     He looks for Pilgrim #3 but can't spot him. And when he turns
     back to the skull -- a face is staring through the combing. But
     it's only...


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Pilgrim #3, inside the skull. Johns enters and chases him out.
     About to leave, Johns notices...

     Bone-chippings piled on the ground. It could be nothing, but
     still...

     Johns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his
     shotgun. Satisfied, Johns exits. Now BOOM UP to reveal...

     Riddick. Hidden in a sinus cavity.


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Trailing the others, Fry pauses to change out the O2 on her
     breather.


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Riddick drops to the ground. His arms and hands are now pierced
     with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons.
     Spotting a shadow on the combing, he draws closer. And sees Fry.
     Alone.


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Johns doubles back to Fry. He takes a hit of scotch, offers her
     some.

                              FRY
               Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you
               even more.

                              JOHNS
               Probably right.

     They drink anyway. Moving out of the sun, Fry leans up against
     the combing. It brings her within arm's length of...


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Riddick. He pulls a bone-shiv, freshly chiseled.

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               You know, I woulda played road dog for
               these guys. You could've stayed back.
               Pro'bly should've -- because, you know,
               if we don't find water....

     "We may not make it back."

                              FRY (O.S.)
               No, no, I wanted to get away.

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               So I noticed. Never seen a "captain"
               quite so ready to leave her ship.

     Just as Riddick eases his blade toward Fry's neck...


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     She steps away.

                              FRY
               Better keep moving....

                              JOHNS
               What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching
               the switch?

     Fry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and
     again she leans back on the combing. We can actually see Riddick
     now. They could too, if they would just TURN THE FUCK AROUND!

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.

                              FRY
               Promise me. Swear to me you won't --

                              JOHNS
               You see anybody else here? Just between
               you and me.

                              FRY
               During the landing...when things were
               at their worst...Owens was at his best.
               He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot
               dump the passenger cabin.

     Johns blinks, stunned. "Are you shittin' me?"


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Trying again, Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly
     slices off some of Fry's hair. A locket. A souvenir. That's
     all he wanted.

                              FRY (O.S.)
               So now you know.

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than
               I thought.

     Riddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle,
     left behind. It's still got one good swallow.


     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - DAY

     Leaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the
     hills. Ahead is a canyon.

                              JOHNS
               Hold up.

     He jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Didn't bite.

                              FRY
               What?

                              JOHNS
               Thought he might be coolin' it in the
               boneyard -- could either double-back to
               the ship or slip in behind us. So I left
               the bottle out as bait.

     SCOPE POV: PANNING the boneyard. FINDING the bottle. It's
     still got that one swallow.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               But nah. Didn't bite.


     EXT. BONEYARD - DAY

     CLOSER on the bottle. Only we see that the scotch has been
     emptied -- and replaced with sand.


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     Working under the shade of a tarp, Zeke digs a communal grave.
     Three wrapped corpses wait nearby. He keeps a sight-line on...

     The crash ship. Shazza waves. Zeke waves back.


     EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY

     The scouting party transits a narrowing canyon. Lined with rib
     bones, it makes us feel like we're in the belly of some beast.

     Fry squints at the ridgetops. More of those spires are visible
     on the canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels. "What are
     they? Just mineral deposits?"

                              PILGRIM #1
               Captain...captain....

     The Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant.
     Leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core.
     ARABIC DISCUSSION. Desert fruit? Is it edible?

                              FRY
               Wait, wait, wait....

     Fry takes the "plant," pushes the "petals" back down over the
     core. They all stare. It's a baseball.

                              IMAM
               We are not alone here, yes?

     They look ahead, wondering what awaits them. But Johns is
     looking back.

                              JOHNS
               Never thought we were.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     HIGH ANGLE: An old WEATHER COCK CREAKS in the wind. Fry,
     Johns, and the Chrislams enter FRAME far below.

                              PILGRIM #1
               Assalamoo ahlaykum!

     The GREETING ECHOES through the settlement, built from stacked
     shipping containers. Tattered sun-shades flap in the wind. A
     rusty bike lies on the ground.

                              PILGRIM #2
               Assalamoo ahlaykum!

                              JOHNS
               Long gone. Whoever they were.

     They move around a building -- and pull up short. Before them
     looms a moisture-recovery unit, a hulking machine in disrepair.
     Old jugs litter the ground.

                              IMAM
               Water...water there was here....

                              PILGRIMS
               Allahu Akbar....


                              IMAM
                         (translating)
               "God is Great," yes?

                              JOHNS
               I'm born-again.

     Fry manages a weary smile -- but soon her eyes revisit the
     abandoned buildings. "Who were these people? Why did they
     leave so much behind?"


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Through a window, we see the Johns and the Chrislams crawling
     over the moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs. PULL BACK to
     include Fry inside the settlement, inspecting...

     Refectory table. Place settings out. Years of dust.

     Photos on the wall: Settlers working modest gardens. Playing
     baseball. Posing with children.

     INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Fry enters a dark room.

                              FRY
               Lights.

     No response to her command. She pats around for old-style wall
     switches. Nothing. Perceiving black-out blinds on a window, she
     throws them open to reveal...

     A man standing right outside.

                              JOHNS
                         (through window)
               Hey. Don't go too far, huh?

     Fry nods. Johns smiles, leaves. Just as her heart settles,
     SOMETHING CREAKS behind her.

     It's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the
     planets around their suns. Solar powered, the orrery starts
     turning, CREAKING. One planet seems always to have sunlight.

                              FRY
               No darkness. No lights because no
               darkness....


     EXT. PORCH - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Fry reaches a porch. It looks out over the rear of the
     settlement and more unforgiving terrain. She starts back
     inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision. Fry
     turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the
     source of the glint.

     Excited hits on her breather.

     Fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic
     bearing. Soon she's running.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

                              FRY (V.O.)
               Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!

     Johns and the Chrislams trade looks.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

                              FRY
               Allahu Akbar!

     Fry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath. The others catch
     up. They too marvel at...

     The skiff, a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part bush
     plane, part space craft. Its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but
     the hull looks intact.


     EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY

     CLOSE on caviar being added to toast-points.

     A SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris in mid-bite. He eases out of his
     rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on...

     A shadow ducking under him. Small rocks still trickle down a
     dirt rampart just climbed by...someone.

                              PARIS
               This now qualifies as the worst fun I've
               ever had. Stop it.

     No response.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     War-pick in hand, Paris eases to ground-level. He checks the
     perimeter, looks inside the ship. Nobody. Is he being fucked
     with? Again? He hopes?

                              PARIS
               Audrey? Oh, Audrey....

                              AUDREY (O.S.)
               What?

     Paris spins. The voice came from the cargo hold -- and not where
     he expected.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     Blades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull. Paris
     enters to find Shazza and Audrey cutting open containers,
     searching for usable goods.

                              PARIS
               Tell me that was you.

                              AUDREY
               Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?

                              PARIS
               Assailing my fragile sense of security,
               that's what.

                              SHAZZA
               What're you goin' on about? She's been
               right here for the last....

     They all see it: Sun-blades are momentarily blocked by something
     passing outside. Someone.

                              SHAZZA
                         (a quiet probe)
               Zeke?

     No answer. Audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye
     to a crack there.

     HULL-CRACK POV: Far away, Zeke finishes digging the grave. He
     starts toward the ship.

     Audrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: "RIDDICK!"

     Paris goes bloodless. Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his
     frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there,
     ready to strike. Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang.
     All eyes watch as...

     The sun-blades, winking off and on, chart Riddick's approach:
     We feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the
     blades shave closer and closer to us. Suddenly he appears...

     And Shazza swings hard.

                              AUDREY
               No!

     Facing them is a TOTAL STRANGER -- burned, half naked, one hand
     still clutching the emergency-release lever of his cryo-locker.
     Shazza stopped one inch short of killing him.

                              TOTAL STRANGER
               I thought...my God, I thought I was the
               only one who....

     He lurches toward Shazza, trying to embrace her -- and sees blood
     and brain-bits BLAM-BLAMMING against her. His own. The stranger
     sinks bonelessly to the ground. FAST RACK to reveal Zeke in the
     background, pistol leveled. He reads Shazza's horrified face --
     and understands what he's done.

                              PARIS
               Oh, Lord....

                              AUDREY
               It was just somebody else. From the
               crash. He was just....

                              ZEKE
               Cripes galore, I thought it was him. The
               murderin' ratbag. I thought he was....

     He rushes over to check the dead stranger. As he bends down,
     FAST RACK AGAIN to reveal Riddick in the background. He stands
     20 paces off, still unseen by the others. His goggle eyes
     covet...

     Zeke's breather.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

     Fry exits the skiff.

                              FRY
               No juice, looks like it's been laid up
               for years. But we might be able to
               adapt --

                              JOHNS
               Shut up.

     Outside, Johns has an ear cocked to the wind.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Sorry. Thought I heard something.

                              FRY
               Like what?

                              JOHNS
               Like my pistola.


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     START on the drag-sled carrying Corpse #4-- the stranger.

     Zeke reaches the grave. The sun-tarp has fallen on one side,
     blocking the sight-line between ship and grave. Zeke starts to
     unload the body -- but sees something he didn't notice before:
     There's some kind of opening at the bottom of the grave.

                              ZEKE
               Now what the bloody hell....

     Zeke hops down into the grave. CAMERA MOVES to reveal Riddick
     hidden among the spires. He's been waiting for a chance just
     like this.


     EXT. GRAVE - DAY

     Zeke drops to all fours. Looks into the tunnel. There seems to
     be some kind of burrow beyond.

     BURROW POV: Staring back at Zeke.

     Zeke takes a handlight off his belt, shines it into the burrow.
     It's the last thing he ever does.


     INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     As MORE GUNSHOTS jar Paris, Audrey, Shazza.


     EXT. GRAVE - DAY

     FURIOUS CLOSEUPS: Zeke fighting for his life. PISTOL BLASTING.
     Something slashing at him. Blood dancing on air.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Shazza sprints across hard-pack, heading for...


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     The grave. She slaps aside the tarp to find...

     Riddick. Bone-shiv in hand, he just stands on the other side of
     the grave. Shazza looks down. And SCREAMS.


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     CAMERA PURSUES Riddick as he lopes through the spires, running
     from the scene of the crime. He turns a blind corner -- and
     SOMETHING NEARLY BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF at close range. He hits
     ground. A boot steps on his neck, keeping him there.

                              JOHNS
               Same crap, different planet, huh?


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Sucking on their breathers, Fry and the Chrislams make it back to
     the ship. They find Johns beating Riddick like a chained dog.

                              JOHNS
               ...I don't play that...I don't play that
               so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell
               me a better lie....

                              FRY
               Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me
               what....

     She hauls him off -- only to have Shazza start punching Riddick.

                              SHAZZA
               What'd you do with 'im? You bloody sick
               animal you, what'dja do with me Zeke?


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     Fry and Johns stand over the grave. It's a gory mess -- but no
     sign of Zeke. Johns has Riddick's confiscated shiv.

                              FRY
               He used that?

                              JOHNS
               Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.

                              FRY
               So why isn't it all bloody?

                              JOHNS
               I assume he licked it clean.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening
     to SOTTO VOCE VOICES outside. Fry enters, looks at him hard.

                              FRY
               So where is he?

     Riddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle-lens. The eye
     beneath is closed: For some reason, he won't look at her.

                              FRY
               Tell me about the sounds. You told them
               you heard something right before....
                         (no response)
               If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take
               another crack at it -- at your skull.

                              RIDDICK
               'Mean the whispers?

                              FRY
               What whispers?

                              RIDDICK
               The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet
               spot -- just to the left of the spine,
               fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta.
               What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt,
               so I used it to catch a little run-off.
               Metallic taste to it, human blood.
               Coppery. But if you cut it with
               peppermint schnapps, that goes away.
               Course, that's more for winter.
               Summertime, I take mine straight.

     Fry stares. Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as
     Boogeyman: If fear is the only kind of respect he can get,
     Riddick is going to grab some with both hands.

                              FRY
               Why don't we try the truth now?

     A head-shaking beat, then:

                              RIDDICK
               All you people are so scared of me --
               an' most days, I'd take that as a
               compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta
               worry about now.

                              FRY
               Show me your eyes.

     Again he turns away. She strips the goggles off. He sits with
     lids shut tight, anticipating the pain.

                              FRY
               Show me, Riddick.

     Imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first
     time. That's how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No
     irises, just huge black-pool pupils. And from deep within, a
     jewel-like eyeshine. His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as
     those of a starved jaguar.

                              FRY
               You did this? To yourself?

                              RIDDICK
               Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."

                              FRY
               Heard about it. Just never seen it.

                              RIDDICK
               Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say?
               Slamlight's so dim that you go and get
               your eyeballs taken out and shined up --
               then you wind up here. Three ass-kick
               suns.
                         (replacing goggles)
               Maybe I did do a few people. But not this
               one. No ma'am, not this time.

                              FRY
               Then where is he? He's not in the hole.
               We looked.

                              RIDDICK
               Look deeper.

     He CLICKS HIS TONGUE at her.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Chain looped over one shoulder, Fry heads back to the grave site.
     Johns, Imam, Shazza, and Audrey keep pace as...

                              JOHNS
               I know what happened -- he went off on the
               guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and
               now he's trying to --

                              FRY
               Let's just be sure.

                              JOHNS
               I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick
               belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He
               loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you
               afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And
               you're playing right into --

                              FRY
               We're gonna find the body, Johns. Christ,
               you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this?
               We gotta go down and find it.

                              JOHNS
               Well, don't ask me to.

                              FRY
               Thought you didn't believe his story.

                              JOHNS
               I don't. But that ground looked none too
               stable, and I don't want anyone --

                              AUDREY
               If you're afraid, I'll go.

     He shoots Audrey a scowl.

                              FRY
               Nobody else is going down but me, okay?

                              JOHNS
                         (pulling her aside)
               Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now
               doesn't change what came before -- it's
               just stupid.

                              FRY
               What, you think I'm doin' this to prove
               something?

                              JOHNS
               You said it, not me. Let's just not let
               one bad call lead to another.

                              FRY
               Thanks for the tip, Johns.

     "Now get outta my way."


     EXT. GRAVE - DAY

     Chain hooked to her web belt, Fry drops into the grave. She
     peers into the burrow...looks back up at the halo of faces above
     her...then slithers out of sight.


     INT. BURROW - DAY

     Letting her eyes adjust, Fry pats around lightly. Quickly she
     finds Zeke's handlight, tries it. Broken.


     EXT. GRAVE-SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     CLOSE on the chain slithering through hands, playing out as Fry
     moves deeper underground.


     INT. UPHILL TUNNEL - DAY

     Fry makes an uphill turn. Sees a spray of light ahead. Worms
     forward to reach...


     INT. THE LAIR - DAY

     Another chamber, wide and just large enough to stand in. Shafts
     of daylight bore down into the room. More old bones litter the
     floor. Fry moves into one shaft and looks up at...

     An earthen funnel. The inside of a spire.

                              FRY
               They're hollow....

     CLICK-CLICK.

     Fry slow-turns toward the sound.

     CLICK-CLICK-CLICK.

     There's something here, something just beyond the cusp of light.
     Something unfolding.

     An icy hand grips her heart. Soundlessly, Fry backtracks her
     chain, but...

     Something shadows across the exit. It stops her cold.

     Her hand finds something new. She angles it to the light. It's
     one of Zeke's boots -- with a bit of Zeke still in it.

     CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY....

     The whole chamber is coming alive around her, shadows unfurling,
     skulking the perimeter, circling.

     Something impales the boot out of her hand, reclaiming it. It
     was faster than a lightning-strike.

     A paralyzed beat before...

     Fry makes her move, rolling back into the shaft of daylight and
     springing straight up into...


     INT. SPIRE - DAY

     The spire. Bracing against the walls, Fry tries to "walk" her
     way up -- but her chain goes taut. Did it catch on something?
     Or did something catch it? Fry starts pounding the earthen walls.

                              FRY
               Here! I'm in HERE, HERE, HERE!


     EXT. GRAVE-SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

                              IMAM
               Did you hear....

     They drop down and suspend their heads over the bloody grave,
     listening. Nothing now.


     INT. SPIRE - DAY

                              FRY
               I'm over here in the --

     Something tugs on her chain.

                              FRY
               Oh, God....

     CLOSE on her feet. Kicking hard at the walls, trying to gouge
     out footholds.

     A stronger tug. Fry loses altitude, slipping closer to...

     The MADLY CLICKING LAIR below.

     She tries to jettison her belt -- but can't brace herself up and
     undo the belt. Suddenly...

     Something explodes near her head. Daylight appears, followed by
     faces, human faces. They're breaking through the spire with the
     pick-ax. Hands reach inside...


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     ...and birth her into daylight. Overlapping:

                              JOHNS
               We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got
               you now....

                              IMAM
               The child heard you before any of us could
               even....

                              SHAZZA
               Did you find him? You find Zeke?

                              FRY
                         (half insane)
               ...wasn't Riddick...it was...it was...
               goddamn, that was stupid....but wasn't
               Riddick. Somethin' else down there that
               got Zeke and nearly got --

     Her. She flies back into the spire. Something's still got the
     chain.

     The others grab at flailing limbs. It's a tug-of-war now, human
     hands on one end, unseen "hands" on the other -- and the humans
     are losing. Until...

     Imam unsheathes his blade...

     And slices through Fry's belt.


     INT. SPIRE - DAY

     As the chain falls down the spire. Without Fry.


     INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     FAST SHOTS: Survivors packing up O2, liquor, umbrellas, the
     Koran -- whatever qualifies as "essential" on this planet. Amid
     the activity, Audrey pauses to look at...

     The spired hills.


     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Fry and Imam pull a power cell from the ship's battery bay,
     THUMPING it down on the deck.

                              IMAM
               One is all?

                              FRY
               For now.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     At his personal locker, Johns digs out a box of shotgun shells.
     He bypasses the blue-metal shells for a red-metal one. There's
     something special about it -- though what, we can't be sure.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     A shadow falls over Riddick. He doesn't look up.

                              RIDDICK
               Found somethin' worse than me, huh?

                              JOHNS
               We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if
               I shouldn't lighten the load right now.

     Now their eyes meet. Johns RATCHETS HIS SHOTGUN and points it
     at Riddick's head.

                              RIDDICK
               Woof, woof.

     The SHOTGUN EXPLODES. CAMERA PANS off of Johns to show
     Riddick still alive. The shotgun discharged next to his head and
     blew off his wrist chains.

                              JOHNS
               Want you to remember this moment, Riddick.
               The way it coulda gone and didn't.

                              RIDDICK
                         (deaf)
               Say that again.

                              JOHNS
               Here's the deal. You work without the
               chains, without the bit -- without the
               shivs. You help us get off this rock....

                              RIDDICK
               For what? The honor of goin' back to some
               asshole of a cell?

                              JOHNS
               Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this
               head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as
               much as you wanna be free of me.

     A beat. The future rearranges in Riddick's head.

                              RIDDICK
               You'd cut me loose, Boss?

                              JOHNS
               Only if we both get outta this alive.
               And there may be a way.

     He offers a hand to help Riddick up, to seal the deal.

                              RIDDICK
                         (staring at hand)
               My recommendation: Do me. Don't take
               the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on
               your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick.
               Would if I were you.

                              JOHNS
               If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon,
               you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?

     A beat. Riddick reaches out for the hand -- and grabs the
     shotgun with his off-hand. A blur of movement. Suddenly Johns
     is staring at the eyes of his own shotgun.

                              RIDDICK
               Want you to remember this moment.

     He pumps shotgun, spitting blue shells over Johns. He drops the
     emptied gun and walks away.


     EXT. PLANET - DAY

     EXTREMELY WIDE: Blue sun setting, yellow and red sun rising.
     The survivors trek for the settlement. Fry and Imam lug the
     power cell between them, but the real load is shouldered by...

     Riddick. Promoted from murderous monster to beast of burden,
     he tows a drag-sled heavy with cargo.

                              PARIS
                         (to Johns)
               So just like that. Wave your little wand
               and he's one of us now.

                              JOHNS
               Didn't say that. But least this way I
               don't have to worry about falling asleep
               and not wakin' up.

                              IMAM
               Well, I feel we owe Mr. Riddick amends.

                              SHAZZA
               Oh, right. Let's all line up and beg his
               forgiveness. Right you are.

                              IMAM
               At least give the man some oxygen....

                              JOHNS
               He's happy just bein' vertical. Leave him
               be.

                              AUDREY
               So I can talk to him now?

                              JOHNS/SHAZZA
                         (in unison)
               No.

     Paris drops a wine bottle. Trailing, Riddick collects it.

                              PARIS
               Paris P. Ogilvie. Antiquities dealer,
               entrepreneur.

                              RIDDICK
                         (shaking hands)
               Richard B. Riddick. Escaped convict,
               murderer.

     Instead of returning the bottle, Riddick opens it and drinks.
     Paris hurries to catch up to the others.

                              PARIS
               You know, if I owned Hell and this
               planet...I believe I'd rent this out and
               live in Hell.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - DAY

     FRY'S POV: Of spires high above us.

     The group falls silent as they transit the canyon, all eyes on
     the spires. Fry stops short, hearing...

     CLICKITY-CLICK.

     Neck hairs rise -- but soon the sound vanishes. The group starts
     moving again, faster.

     CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICK.

     Are they being stalked? Nervously, Fry traces the sound back
     to...

     Beads dangling from the belt of Pilgrim #1. Whenever he moves,
     the STRINGS CLACK together.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

                              PARIS
               I mean, usually I can appreciate antiques,
               but, uh....

     The survivors have reached the settlement. Fry is trying to get
     the power cell aboard the skiff as the others walk its exterior.

                              JOHNS
               Little ratty-ass.

                              FRY
               Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the
               electrical adapts.

                              SHAZZA
               Not a star-jumper.

                              RIDDICK
               Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back
               up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick
               out a thumb. You'll get picked up.
                         (to Fry)
               Right?

     Fry looks from Riddick to Johns. "How did he know that?"

                              FRY
               Little help here?

     They muscle the power cell aboard. Riddick starts to follow, but
     Johns blocks. He doesn't want Riddick inside.

                              JOHNS
               Check those containers for me. See what
               we can patch wings with.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     With religious fervor, the Chrislams are repairing the moisture-
     recovery unit -- the machine Allah led them to.


     INT. SKIFF - DAY

     START on the battery bay. Hands are adapting the power cell to
     the skiffs older electrical system. Soon...

     Lights wink on throughout the ship.

                              FRY
               Okay, that should buy us a sys-check.
               But we'll need more cells.

                              JOHNS
               How many?

                              FRY
               15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other
               ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five.
               Five total to launch.

                              JOHNS
               25 kilos each, huh?

                              SHAZZA
               Old sand-cat outside. See if I can't get
               it up and chuggin'.

                              JOHNS
               Do it. And if you need an extra hand,
               tap our problem child out....
                         (looking out)
               Where's Riddick?


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     He's walking the ghost town, finding dead gardens...upended
     chairs and furniture...broken skylights. Behind his back...

     Audrey and Pilgrim #3 (the youngest Chrislam) scurry through
     FRAME, stalking this curious monster in their midst.


     EXT. MOISTURE-RECOVERY UNIT - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     CLOSE on the other Chrislams, faces charged with anticipation
     while awaiting...

     The first drop of water. It appears at the bottom of a pipette.

     Tongues fight for it. Another drop forms in its place. Now
     another and another. It brings CHEERS.


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     CLOSE on Paris' hands. Getting ready to celebrate, he unwraps
     crystal goblets...dusts off the refectory table...and rehangs an
     old Christmas garland. INTERCUT WITH...


     EXT. CORING ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Hands digging in dirt.

     Covertly, Audrey and Pilgrim #3 watch Riddick digging near the
     entrance of a tall windowless structure.

     He excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses... a shattered light...
     and a child's tin robot, timeless. Riddick thumbs a solar panel
     clean. The robot's language program warbles to life:

                              ROBOT
               "...to all intruders. I am the guardian
               of this land. I will protect my masters
               at all cost. Death to all intruders..."

     Riddick stands and tries the doors. Locked. He peers through a
     small filthy window. Is there something moving inside? Nothing
     now. Riddick removes some windblown trash from a doorside sign.
     "Coring Room."

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               Missin' the party. C'mon.

     It's Johns, keeping him on a short leash. Leaving, Riddick kicks
     a trash bin. Hard.

                              RIDDICK
               Missin' the party. C'mon.

     He leaves. HOLD on the trash bin a beat.


                              AUDREY (O.S.)
               Talkin' to me?


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     PILGRIM'S POV: Of Audrey exiting the trash bin and running after
     Riddick and Johns.

     Pilgrim #3 is at the window of the coring room. He's found a way
     inside. By the window's feeble light, he starts exploring. Just
     visible at the center of this room is a vertical coring drill.


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

                              IMAM
               ...and for this, our gift of drink, we
               give thanks in the name of our Prophet,
               Muhammad, peace be upon him, and to our
               Lord, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and to his
               father, Allah the Compassionate and the
               Merciful.

                              PARIS
                         (to himself)
               The strangest religion....

     Pilgrims finish pouring cloudy water into goblets. Riddick gets
     the last of it -- the part with sediment. SELECTED CLOSEUPS as
     they drink. Nothing ever tasted finer.

                              PARIS
               Perhaps we should toast our hosts. Who
               were these people, anyway? Miners?

                              SHAZZA
               Looks like geologists. Advance team,
               moves around from rock to rock.

                              JOHNS
               Musta crapped out here, huh?

                              AUDREY
               But why did they leave their ship?

     Silence. It's a question no one has chosen to deal with yet.
     Imam notices one water glass unspoken for.


     EXT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on the "Coring Room" sign. An attached solar panel begins
     moving, orienting toward sunlight. When it catches the full
     brunt of the suns' rays...

     STORM SHUTTERS unlatch on the roof.


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     Pilgrim #3 hears SHOOTING LATCHES overhead. That sound brings
     another sound: A strange SKITTERING. The pilgrim looks up. Is
     there something in the rafters?


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

                              JOHNS
                         (answering Audrey)
               Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.

                              PARIS
               Like an emergency life-raft, right?

                              SHAZZA
               Sure. Coulda had a real drop-ship take
               them off-planet. Long gone.

                              PARIS
               A toast to their ghosts, then....

     Goblets rise.

                              RIDDICK
               Didn't leave, these people. Whatever got
               Zeke got them. They're all dead.

     It's like he just pissed in the punchbowl.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               What, you don't really think they left
               with their clothes on the lines? Photos
               on the walls?

                              SHAZZA
               Maybe they had weight limits, you don't
               know.

                              RIDDICK
               I know you don't uncrate your emergency
               ship unless there's a fucking emergency.

                              JOHNS
               Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your
               theories on --

                              FRY
                         (to Riddick)
               So what happened? Where are they, then?

     Fry is the only one willing to look at reality -- or at least
     glance its way. At the window, Imam scans outside.

                              IMAM
               Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?

                              RIDDICK
                         (to Fry and Imam)
               Has anyone checked the coring room?


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     Now the storm shutters start yawning open, spreading daylight
     over Pilgrim #3 and...

     The ceiling rafters. They're encrusted with thick nests of...
     something. The SKITTERING grows louder, more agitated.

     Sensing trouble, Pilgrim #3 hurries for a sliver of daylight in
     a wall -- the breach he entered through. He never gets there:

     Sunlight hits the first nest. It EXPLODES WITH LIFE.


     INT./EXT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As Imam hears the SCREAM.

                              IMAM
               Ali....


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     CHAOTIC SHOTS: More NESTS EXPLODE into individual creatures,
     winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and
     slashing. His exit blocked, Pilgrim #3 veers into...

     A dark supply room. He slams the door, MUMBLES A BLESSING and
     waits for the storm to pass. He's been cut -- but at least he's
     still alive.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As the survivors run for the coring room.


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As Riddick stays behind to drink their water.


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     HINGES ARE BLASTED AWAY. The door caves in. Imam shoulders
     past Johns to enter and find...

     The empty coring room.

                              IMAM
               Ali?

     A NOISE from the supply room. Is it Ali? Just too scared to
     come out? Imam opens the door...

     And hatchlings pour out.

     Moving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave,
     soar high into the rafters -- then plunge into the coring shaft,
     SQUEALS VANISHING to infinity. Shocked silence, then...

     Pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. He's been shredded into bloody
     kite-tails. There was a nest inside the supply room.

     Imam falls on him in grief. Johns and Fry inch forward to peer
     down...

     The coring shaft. It's littered with human bones. The skeletons
     of the settlers. Scattered about and picked clean.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Against a blue sunrise, the Chrislams hold a prayer service.
     Paris and Audrey attend. Riddick watches from afar.


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

                              SHAZZA
               Why was the door chained up? Why the
               bloody hell would they lock themselves in
               like that?

                              JOHNS
               Not sure, but tell you what: Chrislams
               better not be diggin' another grave out
               there.

                              RIDDICK (O.S.)
               Other buildings weren't secure...

     They turn. Riddick enters.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               ...so they ran here. Heaviest doors.
               Thought they'd be safe inside, but...
                         (looks down shaft)
               Someone forget to lock the back door.

     Shazza joins him at the shaft. Gazing on the human remains:

                              SHAZZA
               So that's what come of me Zeke. An' you
               saw it. You was right there.

     Riddick nods.

                              SHAZZA (CONT'D)
               You were tryin' to kill him too.

                              RIDDICK
                         (shrugging, "not
                          necessarily")
               Just wanted his O-2.
                         (a beat)
               Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass.
               When he shot up that stranger instead.

     Shazza can't deny it. She looks at him differently now, the man
     she once beat while in chains. She takes off her breather.

                              SHAZZA
               Take it.

                              RIDDICK
                         (suspicious)
               What, it's broken?

                              SHAZZA
               Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.

     Riddick accepts it awkwardly, sucks down some pure O2. Johns
     watches the exchange closely, not much liking the idea of Riddick
     being promoted to oxygen-breathing human.

                              JOHNS
                         (to Fry)
               Let's board this up and get the hell gone.
               They seem to stick to the dark, so if we
               stick to daylight, should be all --

                              FRY
               60 years ago.

                              JOHNS
               Wha'?

     Coring samples line the room, laid out on counters. Fry's been
     scrutinizing them.

                              FRY
               Core-samples are dated. Last one is 60
               years ago. This month.

                              SHAZZA
               Yeah? What's special about that?

                              FRY
               Dunno. Maybe nothing, but....

     But now Fry remembers...


     INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     The orrery. The year-counter clicks over to "45" as...

     Fry opens the drive box and starts turning the main gear,
     accelerating the orbits.

     CLOSE on the counter. "56...57...58...59...60."

     They all see it: A giant ringed world eclipses the suns and
     plunges their planet into darkness. Persistent darkness.

                              JOHNS
               Are you fuckin' kidding me?

                              RIDDICK
               Not afraid of the dark, are you?


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Crossing the yard in wide strides:

                              FRY
               ...need those cells from the crash ship.
               Shit, still gotta check out the hull,
               patch the wings --

                              JOHNS
               Let's wait on the power cells.

                              FRY
               Wait for what? Until it's so dark we
               can't even find our way back to --

                              JOHNS
               We're not sure when it happens, so let's
               not --

                              FRY
               Get the fucking cells over here, Johns.
               What's the discussion?

     A beat.

                              JOHNS
               Ever tell you how Riddick escaped?


     INT. SKIFF - DAY

     Alone inside the skiff, Johns and Fry continue with more privacy.

                              FRY
                         (jarred)
               He can pilot?

                              JOHNS
               Hijacked a prison transport, made a
               helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.

                              FRY
                         (with faint hope)
               Okay, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe I
               can use him to help with --

                              JOHNS
               He also figured out how to kill the pilot,
               Fry.

     A mental shiver.

                              FRY
               You said we were going to trust him now.
               You said there was a deal.

                              JOHNS
               That's what I said.

     He challenges her to read his mind.

                              FRY
               Oh, this is a dangerous game you're
               playing, Johns.

                              JOHNS
               May've noticed chains don't work on this
               guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he
               believes he's goin' free. But if he stops
               believin' --

                              FRY
               You mean, if he learns that you're gonna
               royally fuck him over.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               -- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells
               over at the last possible minute -- when
               the wings are ready, when we know we're
               ready to launch.

     Fry looks at him with new eyes.

                              FRY
               You know, he hasn't harmed any of us.
               Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied
               to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns.
               Let him go if that's what it --

                              JOHNS
               He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta
               do his bid.

     Shaking her head, she looks off.

                              FRY
               Dancin' on razor blades here...

                              JOHNS
               I won't give him a chance to grab another
               ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.


     EXT. SKIFF - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Johns descends the gangway -- and finds Riddick erecting a field
     table in the shade of the skiff. He seems out of earshot. Now,
     anyway. As they trade looks, another flu-like shiver runs
     through Johns.

                              RIDDICK
               Bad sign. Shakin' like that in this heat.

     Johns moves on. The Chrislams appear, shouldering a roll of
     Vectran (wing-fabric material). They drop it on the table.
     Ready to cut bindings, Imam pats his hip for the knife that was
     just there.

                              RIDDICK
                         (looking after Johns)
               I'll cut.

     He has the knife.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As Shazza and Audrey repair the sand-cat.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

     CLOSE on the knife slicing through the Vectran.

     Riddick hands the trim to Pilgrim #1. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he
     scampers onto the skiff...balance-beams over wing-struts...and
     delivers the piece to Imam, who stitches the fabric like an old
     Berber rug-weaver. Pilgrim #1 pauses to check on...

     The setting blue sun. Nothing unusual. Yet.


     INT. SKIFF - DAY

     The hatch closes, seals.

     CLOSE on a monitor. A "HULL INTEGRITY TEST" is underway. Fry
     scans rising pressure gauges.

                              RIDDICK (O.S.)
               Looks like we're a few shy....

     Fry whirls. Riddick is aboard, staring at the depleted battery
     bay. And he has Imam's blade.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               Power cells.

                              FRY
               They're coming.

                              RIDDICK
               Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main
               drive yet.
                         (half-beat)
               Strange unless he told you the particulars
               of my escape.

                              FRY
               I got the quick-and-ugly version.

                              RIDDICK
               An' now you're worried about a repeat of
               history?

                              FRY
               Entered our minds.

                              RIDDICK
               I asked what you thought.

                              FRY
               You scare me, Riddick. That's what you
               wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it,
               Can I get back to work now?

     She finds the courage to turn her back on him. Riddick moves
     closer -- and takes a beat to scan the controls. The cabin
     pressure builds.

                              RIDDICK
               Think Johns is an do-right man? You
               think I can trust him to cut me loose?

     A beat. Does Riddick already know? Is he testing her?

                              FRY
               Why, what'd you hear?

                              RIDDICK
               Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd
               just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth
               twice as much alive.
                         (reading her face)
               Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's
               got that shiny badge an' all, but nah --
               he's just a merc and I'm just a payday.
               That's why he won't kill me. The creed is
               greed.

     It knocks her off stride, but...

                              FRY
               Save it, Riddick. We aren't gonna turn on
               each other -- no matter how hard you try.

     Riddick moves right up behind her.

                              RIDDICK
               I don't truly know what's gonna happen
               when the lights go out, Carolyn -- but I
               do know that once the dyin' starts, this
               little psycho family of ours is gonna rip
               itself apart. So you better find out the
               truth. Come nightfall, you better know
               exactly who's standing behind you.

     A monitor chirps the news: "HULL INTEGRITY --100%." EXHALING
     GASSES, the hatch opens automatically.

                              RIDDICK
               Oh, ask him 'bout those shakes. And ask
               why your crew-pal had to scream like that
               'fore he died.


     INT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     CLOSEUPS: Hands select a red-metal shotgun shell from a box...
     pull the shell open...remove a glass ampule hidden inside...drop
     the ampule into a injection syringe. The syringe touches an
     eager arm vein.

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Who are you? Really?

     Shirt off, Johns looks up. She's in the doorway.

                              FRY (CONT'D)
               You're not a real cop, are you? Just some
               mercenary who goes around talkin' about
               the law like --

                              JOHNS
               I never said I was.

                              FRY
               Never said you were a hype, either.

     She moves closer. Rummages through his stuff brazenly. Finds a
     shitload of red shells with the hidden ampules.

                              JOHNS
               You have a little caffeine in the morning,
               I have a little morphine. So what?

                              FRY
               And here you got two mornings every day.
               Wow, were you born lucky?

                              JOHNS
               Not a problem unless you're gonna make --

                              FRY
                         (lashing)
               You made it a problem when you let Owens
               die like that. When you had enough drugs
               to knock out a fucking mule-team.

                              JOHNS
               Owens was already dead. His brain just
               hadn't caught on to that fact.

                              FRY
               Anything else we should know about you,
               Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play
               games with our lives when --

     He catches her hands -- and moves them around his body, forcing
     her into an embrace. We understand why when we see a CLOSEUP
     of her hands: They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine.

                              JOHNS
               My first run-in with Riddick. Went for
               the sweet-spot and missed. They had to
               leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can
               feel it, sometimes, pressing against the
               cord.
                         (giving her hands back)
               So maybe the care and feeding of my
               nerve-endings is my business.

                              FRY
               You coulda helped. And you didn't.

     O.S., we hear the Chrislams JABBERING ARABIC and calling for
     "Captain, Captain...."

                              JOHNS
               Yeah, well, look to thine own ass first.
               Right, "captain"?

     It cuts deep.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Fry and Johns move outside. The others have gathered, all eyes
     gang-locked on...

     An arch in the sky. Luminous, ominous, it grows from the horizon.

                              PARIS
               What do my eyes see?

                              FRY
               It's starting....

     They watch hypnotically as the arch rises, inching toward the two
     suns. Shazza shakes out of the trance first.

                              SHAZZA
                         (to Fry)
               If we need anything from the crash ship --
               I suggest we kick on. That sand-cat's
               solar.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     MULTIPLE SHOTS: Shazza cranking the sand-cat...hands snatching
     up lights, water, ropes...Chrislams piling aboard the sand-cat.

                              FRY
               LET'S GET THOSE CELLS!

     Sand-cat moving...Riddick jumping onto the rear bed....Paris and
     Audrey running, catching up.

                              SHAZZA
               We stay together! C'mon!


     INT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Johns doubles back, grabs his shotgun shells, swings out the
     door...


     EXT. INCINERATOR - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     ...and catches up to the sand-cat. Riddick reels him aboard.

                              RIDDICK
               Don't wanna miss this.

                              AUDREY
               Lookit. Lookit!

     They turn back to see the rim of a giant planet. It's cresting
     over the horizon. The luminous arch is the planet's rings.


     EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY

     The sand-cat storms through the canyon. As it passes through the
     massive ribcage...

     The ROLL CAGE SMASHES OUT some low-bridge bones.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     The sand-cat reaches the crash ship. Bodies leap off. Paris
     steals a look at...

     The rising planet. It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe.


     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Johns yanks the first power cell and starts dragging it over the
     deck. Riddick yanks a second cell and, carrying it on his
     shoulder, passes Johns with a suck-my-ass grin. Johns shoulders
     his cell and stumbles after.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Shazza wheels the sand-cat around, getting clearance between it
     and the ship.

     The Chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat.

     Riddick drops the first cell onto the sled, Johns the second.
     They're racing the eclipse and each other.


     EXT. SKY - DAY TO DUSK

     As the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DUSK

     It's like God just closed a blind: Daylight dims. The change in
     light brings a GROWING HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.

                              FRY
               Don't stop, don't stop....

     But Paris can't help himself. He squints to see...


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DUSK

     The spires. THE SOUND seems to come from there.


     EXT. SKY - DUSK

     As the rings eclipse the red sun.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

     A second darkness sweeps over the survivors. Now they all stop,
     beholding...


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK

     Something pouring from the spire-tops. Backlit by coronal light,
     it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these
     are living things, HATCHLINGS SQUEALING IN DELIGHT over their
     first nightfall.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

                              JOHNS
               Jesus, how many can there....

     They keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. Mercifully,
     the hatchlings seem to be moving away. But now one wave cleaves
     from another -- and does a quick about-face.

                              PARIS
               Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should
               flee.

                              FRY
               Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold.
               lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.

     They run. Reach the cargo hold. Turn back to see...

     Riddick and Shazza still coming. Hearing the SQUEALING WAVE
     descending on them...

     Riddick and Shazza hit to the dirt. Hatchlings torrent just
     inches overhead.

     CLOSE on Shazza. Horrified. Hard to breathe. Like being
     underwater.

     CLOSE on Riddick. He watches in awe, no more frightened that a
     kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. Experimenting, he
     eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings. Instantly it's whittled
     down to nothing. It's like a river of razor blades.

     The hatchling keep coming. Shazza whips a panicky look at the
     cargo hold. Can she make it? Should she even try?

                              AUDREY
               Tell her to stay there. Stay down.
               SHAZZA, JUST STAY DOWN!

     Shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. Suddenly the
     hatchings vanish. A beat. Is it safe? Shazza gets to her
     feet...

                              FRY
               No, no, NO, NO, NO....

     ...and the wave is back, enveloping Shazza.


     INT./EXT. CARGO HOLD - DEEP DUSK

     Standing in the mouth of the cargo container, the others get a
     last glimpse of Shazza as she flies by the doors, caught up in
     the funnel-cloud of hatchlings. Then she's simply gone.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

     Still on the ground, Riddick checks left and right like someone
     about to cross a busy street. Now he gets up, smacks his hands
     clean, strolls for the hold. Behind him...

     A rising GANG-CLICKING.

     CLOSE on Fry. She knows the sound better than anyone.


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK

     The spires are crumbling, torn down from within.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

     Reaching the cargo hold, Riddick turns around for one last look.
     PUSH IN as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his
     jaguar eyes.

     RIDDICK'S POV: In degraded image, we see the predators -- adult
     hatchlings -- emerge from the spires. They're large, mammalian,
     hammer-headed. They CLICK with echo-location, sounding out the
     world they haven't inhabited in 60 years.

                              FRY
               What is it? What's happening?

     RIDDICK'S POV: The predators launch from the hills, gliding,
     SOUNDING, searching.

                              RIDDICK
               Like I said. Ain't me you gotta worry
               about.


     EXT. SKY - DEEP DUSK TO NIGHT

     The rim of the planet overtakes both suns. The world goes dark.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Vault-like DOORS BOOM CLOSED.

     The survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship.
     Somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their
     cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths.

                              AUDREY
               What if...what if she's still out there...
               still alive....

                              JOHNS
               Well, I don't want to jump to conclusions
               here...but 'member that boneyard? These
               just might be the fuckers that killed
               every other living thing on this planet,
               okay? Chances of Shazza knockin' on that
               door anytime soon are just about zero
               squared.

                              FRY
                         (agreeing)
               I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't
               a natural die-off.

                              IMAM
               Quiet, please. Everyone.

     Imam is listening at the cargo door. The others pile up
     alongside, ears tuned like radar. CLICKING SWEEPS PAST outside.

                              AUDREY
                         (whispering)
               Why do they do that? Make that sound?

                              IMAM
               Perhaps the way they see. With sound,
               reflecting back.

                              FRY
                         (realizing)
               Echo-location. That's what it is....

     Now MORE CLICKING -- behind them. Lights whip around to find...

     Nothing. Only the door of an open container about halfway down
     the tunnel-like hold.

     A volley of looks. "How the fuck could one get in here?"

                              FRY
               Breach in the hull. I dunno.

     More CLICKING. Johns realizes they expect him to check it out.

                              JOHNS
               I'd rather piss glass.

                              RIDDICK
               Well, you got the big gauge.

                              JOHNS
               Wanna rag your fat mouth?

                              AUDREY
               Maybe it's just their beads again. Imam,
               are you still --

                              IMAM
               No, no, no, I do not believe --

                              JOHNS
               C'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody
               bugfuck with those things. Why don't you
               just lose the goddamn....

     More CLICKING -- along with the sound of TOPPLING CARGO.

                              RIDDICK
               Big beads.

     Butching up, Johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward...

     The open container. Leading with his shotgun, he FIRES blindly
     around the door. Something SQUEALS -- then silence. Johns eases
     his head and a light around the door to spot...

     Hatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food.

                              JOHNS
                         (to others)
               Okay. We're okay. Just some small ones
               that musta --

     Something WHOOSHES for his head, swinging like a scythe. It
     catches his shotgun, DISCHARGING IT, giving us...

     A flash-image of an adult predator. Up close.

     In one thin second, Johns is back with the others.

                              JOHNS
               Very big beads.

                              PARIS
               Not staying in here another....

     He goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night.
     Fry lunges for him.

                              FRY
               Christ, you don't know what's out there!

                              PARIS
               I know what's in here!

                              IMAM
               Everybody come, this way and we should be
               safe. Hurry, please....


     INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Imam shepherds them into a container. The door slams closed.
     At first, only the sound of MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS. Then a
     SCRATCHING.

     Johns fumbles with a cutting torch. Gets it burning. Adjusts
     the gasses to illuminate...

     The door. Scythe-like blades are probing joints. Suddenly HEAVY
     BLOWS drive everyone back.

                              RIDDICK
                         (to Johns)
               Can you do sumpin' else with that?
               'Sides holding it in my fucking face?

     Taking the hint, Johns starts cutting the common wall between
     containers. It's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the
     blades of the predators.


     INT. SECOND CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     An burn-outline appears in the common wall. Johns kicks out the
     escape hatch. Audrey speed-crawls through first as...


     INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Predators shred into the container right behind them, CLICKING,
     sweeping, hunting.


     INT. THIRD/FOURTH CONTAINERS - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     SERIES OF SHOTS: Again and again, they burn a new escape hatch
     just as the predators break into the container being vacated,
     always entering darkness.


     INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Inside their fifth container now, Johns torches away. Fry and
     Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the
     cargo with their bodies.

     Riddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the
     cargo. Suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind...

                              PARIS
               Hello, hello?

     ...and moves to the front of the container where darkness
     prevails. Something SQUISHES underfoot. He slips off goggles.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of dead hatchlings on the floor. This is the
     open container, the one where Johns found predators.

     Sensing energy, Riddick lifts his face.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of an adolescent predator. It squats atop cargo,
     eating a hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull.

     Sensing Riddick, it sweeps the area with INQUISITIVE CLICKS.

     PREDATOR POV: Of Riddick.

     (NOTE: The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression
     without detail. We're "seeing" what the predator hears with
     echo-location. Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its
     subject in 3-D space.)

     Oblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. Audrey,
     Fry, and Johns worm through. Imam and Pilgrim #2 hang back.
     "Where's Riddick?"

     He's in a stare-down with a predator.

     Searching, Pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head
     caught in a vice-like grip.

                              RIDDICK
               Don't. Move.

     RIDDICK'S POV: As a second predator appears above them. This
     one reaches down with its scythe blade...

     And gently probes the two men. It wants know what they're made
     of.

     CLOSE on the pilgrim's shoes. Over-running with piss.

     More blades descend, moving over them like surgical instruments.
     One test-slices Riddick's shirt.


     INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     In the next container, Fry waits anxiously. Hissing through the
     escape hatch:

                              FRY
               Imam? Where are they?


     INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a predator's scythe blade. It test-slices the pilgrim's
     skin. Blood wells up. All CLICKING CEASES.

                              IMAM (O.S.)
               Hasan?

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Riddick?

     TIGHT on the pilgrim -- more scared now that the clicking has
     stopped. Losing his nerve, he bolts.

                              RIDDICK
               No....

     The predators are on him, just blurs in the dark. DEATH-SCREAM.

     RIDDICK'S POV: A third predator appears above him.

     Making his move, Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the
     escape hatch as...

     Fry's light catches him square in the face. Blinded, Riddick
     HOWLS and stumbles forward. Fry's light leaps deeper to hit...

     The predator right behind him. With a similar reaction, the
     beast HOWLS and flails back.

     HOLD on Fry for a time-stopped moment. What stopped it? Was it
     really her? Suddenly a SHOTGUN EXPLODES beside her head. Jacked
     up, Johns is BLASTING shadows.

                              FRY
               Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!

                              JOHNS
               'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.

     They give him a look. "Sure you did." Suddenly a CARCASS SLAMS
     to the floor, sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash-
     pattern. "Christ, he did kill one."

     Fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass.
     Wherever the light strikes it, the flesh chars and steams.

                              FRY
               There....

                              PARIS
               Like the light is scalding it.

                              FRY
               It hurts them. Light actually hurts
               them....

     VULTURE SOUNDS from the two O.S. adolescents, fighting over the
     scraps of the pilgrim.

                              IMAM
               Is that...Hasan?

     Riddick nods.

                              JOHNS
               We'll burn a candle for him later. C'mon.


     INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Cargo has been shoved against the door and walls. The survivors
     gather around Fry's handlight. Audrey -- tough little Audrey --
     has been reduced to a shivering lump of mush.

                              FRY
               ...one cutting torch...one handlight here,
               two more in the cabin...I think two
               more....

                              PARIS
               Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns
               well.

                              FRY
               How many bottles?

                              PARIS
               Not sure. Ten?

                              FRY
               Those umbrellas, the ones that mist.
               Would they burn?
                         (reading his face)
               If you got a receipt?

                              PARIS
               Possibly.

                              FRY
               Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.

                              JOHNS
               Enough for what?

     Now she challenges him to be the mind-reader.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind,
               I pray you go insane.

                              FRY
                         (to others)
               We can stick to the plan. If we get four
               cells back to the skiff, we're off this
               rock.

                              PARIS
               I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an
               ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at
               night.

                              FRY
               We'll have to carry the cells...drag
               them...whatever it takes.

     Troubled faces. Is it just our imagination? Or is the light on
     the floor growing dimmer?

                              AUDREY
               You mean...tonight? With all those things
               still out there?

                              PARIS
               Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.

                              JOHNS
               Back it up. How long can this last? Few
               minutes? Couple hours?

     No one knows for sure.

                              IMAM
               I had the impression...from the model...
               that the two planets were moving as one.
               That there would be...a lasting darkness.

                              JOHNS
               Those suns gotta come back sometime. And
               if these animals really are phobic about
               light, we just sit tight till then.

                              FRY
               I'm sure that's what someone else said.
               Locked inside that coring room.

     A persuasive thought. Eyes swing back to Audrey.

                              JOHNS
               Look, we gotta think about everyone now --
               the kid especially. How scared is she
               gonna be out there?

                              FRY
               Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke
               screen.

                              JOHNS
               Smoke screen for what?

                              FRY
               For your own fear.

                              JOHNS
                         (eyes narrowing)
               Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two
               seconds and let someone else come up with
               a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?

     Two seconds pass.

                              FRY
               How much you weigh, Johns?

                              JOHNS
               What the hell's it matter?

                              FRY
               How much?

                              JOHNS
               79 kilos.

                              FRY
               Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white
               meat, and that's why you can't come up
               with a better plan.

     He makes a move for her. Riddick blocks. Johns' shotgun bumps
     the underside of Riddick's chin.

                              RIDDICK
               Think about that reward, Johns.

                              JOHNS
               I'm willing to take a cut in pay.

                              RIDDICK
               How 'bout a cut in your gut?

     Johns looks down. CAMERA DROPS to reveal the shiv Riddick holds,
     poised for evisceration.

                              JOHNS
               Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.

                              IMAM
               Please...this solves nothing...please....

     Johns backs off first. The light grows dimmer.

                              FRY
                         (to Audrey)
               They're afraid of our light. That means
               we don't have to be so afraid of them.

                              IMAM
               And you're certain you can find the way
               back? Even in the dark?

                              FRY
               No, I'm not. But he can.

     She's pointing, of course, to Riddick.


     EXT. PLANET - NIGHT

     The eclipsing planet dominates half the sky. In whatever coronal
     light remains, we see clouds forming.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     Cargo doors crack open. Mixed for maximum flame, the cutter is
     pushed outside and swept around. Fry appears behind it.

     Moving like hostages, the survivors cross open ground, trying not
     to heed the PRIMAL SOUNDS beyond their light. Soon they reach...

     The main cabin. Blackness inside.

                              FRY
               Riddick.

     He lifts his goggles.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Checking the cabin. Finding a lot of wreckage
     but no life.

                              RIDDICK
               Looks clear.

     Johns shoulders ahead and crawls in first. Just as he stands up
     inside...

     A PREDATOR BUZZSAWS over his head, fleeing the cabin, taking off
     into the night.

                              JOHNS
               Fuck me. You said "clear."

                              RIDDICK
               Said "looks clear."

                              JOHNS
               Well, what's it look like now?

                              RIDDICK
                         (rechecking)
               Looks clear.

                              FRY
               Just get the goddamn lights on....

     They scramble aboard. Riddick TONGUE-CLICKS behind Johns.
     He isn't amused.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     PREP MONTAGE: We see the survivors powering up cabin lights...
     yanking three more cells from the battery bay...threading nylon
     cord through Paris' misting umbrellas, filling the reservoirs
     with high-octane liquor...swapping out O2 canisters.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     Reloading his shotgun, Johns finds himself shaking again. He
     unpockets a shell -- a red morphine shell -- and gives it a
     lover's look. Behind him...

                              FRY
               Ready, Johns.

     He palms the shell.

                              JOHNS
               He'll lead you over the first cliff.
               You know that, don't you?

                              FRY
               We're just burnin' light here.

                              JOHNS
               You give him the cells and the ship --
               and he will leave you. He will leave you
               all out there to die.

                              FRY
               I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn
               valuable in your life that you're worried
               about losing? Huh? Is there anything at
               all? Besides your next hype?
                         (no response)
               Got no right to be so scared. Neither one
               of us.


     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     As hands yank the last power cell.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     Cabin lights die. Still brooding, Johns finishes loading his
     shotgun in the dark.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a burning wick. Alcohol mist shoots across the flame to
     create...

     A FIREBALL. Two umbrella torches, fabric already burned away,
     BELCH FIREBALLS into the night. By this light and more, we see...

     Imam chained into the first harness of the drag-sled. Beside
     him, Johns fumbles with a second harness. Hands help him into
     the chains. The hands belong to...

     Riddick. Both men recognize the irony of the prisoner helping
     his captor into chains.

                              FRY
                         (to all)
               Keep the light going. That's all we have
               to do to live through this. Just keep
               your light burning.

     Riddick loops a handlight over his neck, places it to shine light
     down his back. A beacon.

                              RIDDICK
                         (to Fry)
               Be runnin' about 10 paces ahead. I want
               light on my back -- but not in my eyes.
               And check your cuts. These things know
               our blood now.

     CLOSE on Audrey. Overhearing, she goes stone-faced.

                              FRY
               Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some
               kind of deal. Just in case, you know,
               this actually --

                              RIDDICK
                         (shaking head)
               Had it with deals.

                              FRY
               But I just wanted to say --

                              RIDDICK
               Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose.
               I fuckin' knew better.

     It worries Fry. "If he doesn't expect to go free...."

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               Been a long time since anyone's trusted
               me. That's somethin' right there.

                              FRY
               We can, can't we? Trust you?

                              RIDDICK
               Actually...
                         (completely genuine)
               That's what I been askin' myself.

     He walks away. HOLD on Fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a
     terrible, terrible mistake.


     EXT. NIGHT

     The drag-sled begins moving.

     SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS: Riddick running point, goggles off,
     eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like
     malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side-
     guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position
     carrying an umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling
     along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every
     shadow a threat. They are a train of light.

     CLOSE on the sled. Holding four power cells and eight bottles
     of booze.

     CLOSE on Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Below us run the survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY so that their
     lights become insignificant...so that we include, in FOREGROUND,
     the silhouettes of gliding predators. They're following from
     above, awaiting their chance.


     EXT. NIGHT

     FRY'S POV: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have vanished.

                              JOHNS
               So you noticed too?

                              FRY
               Riddick. Riddick.

     The procession grinds to a halt. Everyone sucks hard on
     breathers as they muster inside the light.

                              FRY
               Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't
               we still following them?

                              RIDDICK
               Saw something I didn't like.

                              JOHNS
               Such as.

                              RIDDICK
               Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me...
               but looked like a bunch of those big boys
               chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought
               we'd swing wide. Okay by you?

     Paris looks over his shoulder. "We went around what?" Nearby
     CLICKING breaks up the confrontation.

                              FRY
               Let's move.
                         (to Audrey)
               Just a detour. He'll get us there.

                              PARIS
               Can we switch?

                              FRY
               What, switch what?

                              PARIS
               I think I twisted my ankle running
               backwards like that. And I'm not sure I
               can....
                         (off their stares)
               Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to
               be alone back there anymore. If you could
               just give me a few minutes up front here --

                              JOHNS
               She's the pilot, she should stay close to
               the cells.

                              PARIS
               Oh, so I'm disposable?

                              FRY
               I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ, just
               get this train moving!


     EXT. NIGHT

     They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner.

     At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING
     never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his
     torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty.

                              PARIS
               Light, please, need light here....

     Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he
     refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl.

     A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam
     lunges at the last nanosecond...

     And flattens Audrey to the ground. Scythe blades swing...

     CHINKING the harness-chains on Imam's back.

     Johns whirls, BLASTS. Light-beams leap around. But the predator
     is long gone.

                              IMAM
                         (trembling)
               Please...have we been cut? Can someone
               tell me if....

     He finds his dropped light, thumbs the switch again and again.
     Broken.

     In the confusion, Paris has been left in the dark. Something
     slashes him from behind. It's like the night has claws.

                              PARIS
               Oh, sweet Jesus....

     The bottle drops.

     The blood flows.

     The CLICKING STOPS.

                              PARIS
               Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME
               LIGHT OVER HERE!

     Faces whip around. But before their lights can rescue him...

     Paris is gone, snatched away by a swooping blur.

     Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of predators feasting on Paris. Carrying a
     youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't
     find a place at the trough. With shocking apathy, it whips the
     youngling off its back and begins devouring it. Other predators
     start in-fighting, killing themselves for food. POV PANS to a
     pair of predators, closer, SOUNDING out new prey. POV PANS
     AGAIN to include the object of their desire. Audrey.

     CLOSE on Riddick. Trying to figure it out.

     CLOSE on Audrey. Listening to the HORRIFIC FEEDING SOUNDS.
     Oblivious to all the attention she's getting.

                              FRY
               What do you see? Riddick?

                              RIDDICK
               Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.


     EXT. SKY - NIGHT

     As clouds mass.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Into a rising wind, the survivors range on.

     Audrey now carries Paris' torch, refueled and COUGHING FIREBALLS
     at regular intervals. Fry seems to be handling rear-point fairly
     well, until...

     The cutter sputters and dies. She ditches it and takes the torch
     from Audrey.

                              FRY
               Bottle-count.

                              AUDREY
               Four fulls, one half. That mean we're
               halfway there? I hope?

     Good question. They've just been blindly following...

     The light on Riddick's back.

                              FRY
               Can we pick up the pace?

     Working like a mule, Johns growls to himself. "If you think you
     can do better...." Abruptly he slaps an arm across Imam's chest,
     spotting...

     A sled-track. In front of them.

     Fry hears a SHOTGUN RATCHET. She spins to see...

     Johns out of his chains. Moving forward. Jamming the shotgun
     into the back of Riddick's neck.

                              JOHNS
               We aren't completely stupid.

                              FRY
               Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in
               the fucking --

                              IMAM
               We crossed our own tracks.

                              JOHNS
               He's running us 'round in circles. Look
               for yourself. Look!

                              FRY
               Riddick? What the hell are you --

                              RIDDICK
               Listen.

     Imagine a hundred Geiger-counters next to a truckload of
     plutonium. That's the SOUND that rides the wind now.

                              RIDDICK
               Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some
               time to think.

                              FRY
               Think about what?

                              JOHNS
               About how to kill us and still get these
               cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just
               doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!

                              RIDDICK
                         (answering Fry)
               About the girl.

                              FRY
               What about her?

                              RIDDICK
               What it's gonna be like when we hit that
               canyon. With her bleeding.

                              JOHNS
               What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not
               cut.

                              RIDDICK
                         (agreeing)
               No. She's not.

     It hits Fry like a two-by-four. She looks at Audrey.

                              AUDREY
                         (confessing)
               I didn't want you to leave me there...
               back at the ship...that's why I didn't
               say anything....

                              FRY
               No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you
               shoulda told me sooner.

                              JOHNS
                         (finally getting it)
               Aw, this can't be happening to me....

                              RIDDICK
               They been nose-open for her ever since we
               left. They go off blood.

                              IMAM
               Well...we must keep her close, then.
               Here, she'll be safe if we put her
               between --

                              RIDDICK
                         (scanning)
               There is no "safe."

     An epic beat. The wind gusts...the FLAMES CHATTER...their ears
     fill with CANYON SOUNDS.

                              FRY
               It's not gonna work. We gotta go back.

     Johns brays.

                              JOHNS
               Hey, you're the one who got me out here,
               turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An'
               now you 'spect me to go back like a
               whipped dog?

                              FRY
               I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay?
               Now let's just go back to the ship.

                              JOHNS
               I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces --
               you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out
               here.

                              FRY
               Are you fucking high again? Just listen
               to --

                              JOHNS
               No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be
               afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of
               meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say
               mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred
               meters, after that we're in Skiff City!
               So why don't you just butch up, stuff a
               cork in that kid, and get --

                              IMAM
               She's the captain, we should listen to --

                              JOHNS
               Listen to her? Her? When she was willing
               to sacrifice us all?

     A beat. Eyes turn to Fry. She wants to protest -- but can't.

                              AUDREY
               What's he talkin' about?

                              JOHNS
               During the crash, she --

                              FRY
                         (a warning growl)
               This does not help us, Johns.

                              JOHNS
               -- she tried to blow the whole fucking
               passenger cabin, tried to kill us --

                              FRY
               Just shut up, okay?

                              JOHNS
               -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris
               had it right -- we are disposable. We're
               just walking ghosts to her.

                              FRY
               Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!

     She rushes him, ready to rip his eyes out. He shunts her aside.

                              JOHNS
               We're not alive because of her -- we're
               alive in spite of her.

     He swung below the belt -- and connected. Fry's chin quakes,
     her knees fail. The undertow of events finally pulls her down.

                              FRY
               We cannot go through there....

                              JOHNS
                         (lording)
               How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?

                              IMAM
                         (pushing him back)
               Fine, fine, you've made your point. We
               can all be so scared as you.

     Johns snatches a light away from Imam.

                              JOHNS
                         (to all)
               Verdict's in. The light moves forward.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     They trudge on, slower now, building reserves for the canyon-run.
     At rear-point, Fry follows like a broken rudder. Pilgrim #1 now
     draws the sled with Imam. And up ahead...


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     Johns falls in step with Riddick.

                              JOHNS
               Ain't all of us gonna make it.

                              RIDDICK
               Just realized that, huh?

     CLICKING nearby. Johns BLASTS the night, driving the sound
     away -- and reminding everyone of who carries the Big Gauge.

                              JOHNS
               Six of us left. If we could get through
               that canyon and lose just one, that'd be
               quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing,
               right?

                              RIDDICK
               Not if I'm the one.

                              JOHNS
               What if you're one of five?

     Riddick stares. "I'm listening."


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              AUDREY
               What're they doin' up there?

                              IMAM
               Talking about the canyon, I suppose.
               How to get us through.

     Overhearing, Fry looks. It's odd to see Johns and Riddick
     walking side by side, like equals. Like partners.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              JOHNS
               Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no
               different than those battlefield doctors
               when they have to decide who lives and who
               dies. It's called "triage," okay?

                              RIDDICK
               Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.

                              JOHNS
               Either way, figure it's something you can
               grab onto.

                              RIDDICK
                         (doping it out)
               Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave
               it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket
               of chum.

                              JOHNS
               Trawl with it. There's a cable on the
               sled. We can drag the body behind us.

                              RIDDICK
               Nice embellishment.

                              JOHNS
               Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just
               keep 'em off our scent.

                              RIDDICK
                         (looking back)
               So which one caught your eye?

                              JOHNS
               Don' look, don' look, don' look....


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     Fry spots Riddick's look -- and Johns' non-look.

                              FRY
               Imam. Slow down.

                              IMAM
               What?

                              FRY
               Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more
               space 'tween us and them.

                              IMAM
               I would rather we all stay--

                              FRY
               Do what I say. Please.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              RIDDICK
               What's her name, anyway?

                              JOHNS
               What do you care?

     Riddick shrugs. "I don't."

                              JOHNS
               Then let's not name the Thanksgiving
               turkey, okay? I assume you still got a
               shiv.

                              RIDDICK
               What, you 'spect me to do it?

                              JOHNS
               What's one more to you? Like this is the
               one that sends you to Hell?

                              RIDDICK
               Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They
               oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere.
               Or forget the museum -- maybe they should
               just hang you.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     As Fry and the others keep slowing.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              JOHNS
               Awright. You do the girl, I'll keep the
               others off your back.

     Riddick stops. Reconsiders.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.

                              RIDDICK
                         (shakes head)
               Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger
               piece of chum.

                              JOHNS
               Like who, Mr. Chrislam?

     EXTREMELY TIGHT on both men: In their eyes, we see the new
     partnership splintering apart: "Like Mr. Johns."

     Riddick makes a play for the shotgun. It BLASTS skyward.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     As the fight erupts:

                              FRY
               Bring the light!

                              AUDREY
               What're they doing? What're we --

                              FRY
               Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     FIGHT SCENE: Johns' light hits the ground, creating an arena of
     illumination. FAST CLICKING nearby. Still struggling, Riddick
     and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and BLAST THE
     CLICKING AWAY.

     The shotgun goes free. Johns lunges for it, but Riddick kicks it
     into the night. And then pulls his shiv.

                              RIDDICK
               Gotta stay in the light, Johns. That's
               the only rule.

     Johns circles inside the light. Fucking with him, Riddick starts
     poking and jabbing, backing him up against the wail of dark.
     Johns stumbles over something. A bone. A club.

     Riddick finds his own bone-club, and now they go at it like two
     cavemen. Riddick beats on Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers,
     forcing him to drop the bone. Just trying to get away now, Johns
     makes a desperate lunge for the light, but...

     Riddick shivs open his back.

                              RIDDICK
               Remember that moment?

     Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light.
     Riddick dogs him.

                              RIDDICK
               Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns.
               You were one brave fuck, before. Now look
               at you. Oh, yeah, you were Billy Bad-ass
               with your gauge...with your chains....

     Johns finds the shotgun. "And I'm still Billy Bad-ass." He
     sweeps it around with the light, ready to kill...

     Blackness. Where'd Riddick go?

     CLICKING behind Johns. He whirls to see...

     Something big coming for him. Johns BLASTS IT back into the
     night, dropping the light as he does. Eyes in the back of his
     head, he whirls again and takes aim on...

     Another bull-rushing predator.

     Johns triggers a bad round. Crazed, he ratchets and levels the
     shotgun for another try. He's too late.

     BIG CLOSEUP as the ejected shell rolls to a stop. It's red.
     Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark.

     RIDDICK'S POV: With Johns skewered by the armpits, the predator
     lifts him off the ground and "stares" with a deceptively gentle
     CLICKING-COOING SOUND.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Johns' final expression.

     RIDDICK'S POV: The predator rears back its head -- then slams
     forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade,
     splitting him in two.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Fry, Imam, Audrey, Pilgrim #1. They're running, stumbling,
     trying to backtrack the sled marks. Checking for pursuit, Fry
     looks over her shoulder...

     And crashes into Riddick. He was just standing in the dark,
     waiting for them.

                              RIDDICK
               Back to the ship, huh?

                              FRY
               Get out of our way.

                              RIDDICK
               So everybody huddles together till the
               lights burn out? Until you can't see
               what's eating you? That the big plan?

                              IMAM
               Where's Mr. Johns?

                              RIDDICK
               Which half?

                              IMAM
               You mean....

     Conflicted, they all look back. Audrey starts to puddle up.

                              AUDREY
               Gonna lose everybody out here....

                              RIDDICK
               He died fast. And if we got any choice,
               that's the way we should all go out.
                         (to Audrey, softly)
               Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.


     EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     BLACK SCREEN. We hear the canyon in full cry now -- CLICKING...
     BATTLING BONE-BLADES...MATING CRIES...the RENDING OF FLESH
     and SNAPPING OF TENDON. Far below, twin flames appear as the
     survivors reach the gauntlet. Predators perch in FOREGROUND,
     just hulking silhouettes "watching" from a canyon rim.


     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     They are but five: Fry, Riddick, Audrey, Imam, and Pilgrim #1.
     CLOSE on each face as they listen to the CANYON. There must be
     countless predators ahead.

                              FRY
               How many you see?

                              RIDDICK
               One or two.

                              FRY
               Audrey?

                              AUDREY
               Three full bottles. But almost time to
               refill.

                              FRY
               Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on,
               does it?

                              RIDDICK
               Only see one way. Turn the sled over and
               drag it like that, girl down low. Light
               up everything we got -- and run through
               like dogs on fire.

     A beat.

                              IMAM
                         (understanding)
               The sled as a shield....

                              FRY
               And what about the cells?

                              RIDDICK
               I'll take those.

     She looks at him hard.

                              FRY
               We're just here to carry your light,
               aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.

                              RIDDICK
               Let's drop back an' boot up.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     START on the power cells. They're been lashed together into one
     queue.

     Working amid the giant bones, Riddick crafts a new harness from
     the old straps. Close behind him, Imam is MUTTERING IN ARABIC.

                              RIDDICK
               What're you doin'?

                              IMAM
               Blessing you like the others.
                         (off his look)
               It's painless.

                              RIDDICK
               And pointless.

                              IMAM
                         (a beat)
               I see. Well, even if you don't believe
               in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --

                              RIDDICK
               You don't see.

     Riddick shrugs into the harness, snugs it down.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               'Cuz you don't spend half your life in
               lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth
               and not believe. And you surely don't
               start out in a liquor store trash bin with
               an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck
               and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe
               in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.

                              IMAM
               He will be with us. Nonetheless.

                              RIDDICK
               Give my blessing to the girl. She needs
               a spare.


     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     The torches. Maxed out. Burning non-stop.

     Fry and Imam. Sled chains on. Lapping up O2. Each holding a
     torch.

     Pilgrim #1. Clutching a handlight.

     Audrey. Rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a
     metal carapace.

     Riddick. Goggles on. He has no desire to see what horrors will
     surround them. There's just one path, anyway: Straight through.

                              RIDDICK
               As fast as you can.

                              FRY
               You sure you can keep --

                              RIDDICK
               As fast as you can.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     SLEW OF SHOTS: Fry and Imam on the move, dragging the shield
     fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping along
     behind the shield. And Riddick behind them all, face already
     tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet
     somehow keeping pace. The torch flames, stretched by the wind,
     flank them in fire.


     EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     As predators launch from the rim.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     First come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces --
     then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light. Next
     come FERAL SOUNDS overhead.

                              RIDDICK
               Don't look.

     Thin blue liquid spatters them.

                              RIDDICK
               Do not look up.

     More spattering. Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds...

     A ceiling of predators. At the cusp of light, they dive and
     weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND
     OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry
     eels.

                              RIDDICK
               Keep going, keep going, keep going,
               keep going!

     His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry
     keeps her eyes down and speed up.

     More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping
     out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself?

                              IMAM
                         (a muttered mantra)
               "So dark the clouds around my way
                    I cannot see,
               But through the darkness I believe
                    God leadeth me.
               I gladly place my hand in His when
                    all is dim,
               And, closing my weary eyes, lean
                    hard on him...."

     Now WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them, victims
     of in-fighting. Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly
     mess.

     Pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: A blade slices his leg,
     drawing blood. He keeps his mouth shut.


     EXT. CHOKE-POINT - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     The passage narrows into a choke-point. Fry sees it first.

                              FRY
               Riddick? RIDDICK?

     Ahead, a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon.

                              AUDREY
               What? What is it?

                              RIDDICK
               It's a fucking staircase! Go over it!
               GO OVER IT!

     Steeling themselves, they start climbing.

     But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her
     hands. Then, taking exception at being walked on...

     One "corpse" snaps at her. Audrey recoils sideways...

     And tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed.

     PREDATORS' POV: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes from 10
     different predators.

                              FRY
               Audrey!

     Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as...

     A predator kamikazes onto the shield, its bone-blades piercing
     the metal...

     And nearly skewering Audrey beneath.

     Caught in torchlight, steaming, the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries
     to rip free of the shield.

     Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing.

     The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at...

     Riddick, standing at light's edge. Stunningly, he catches the
     beast under its scythe blades, blunting the attack. The predator
     CLICKS MADLY at him.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick's face.

     The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with
     its skull-blade.

     Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand...

     ...yanks his shiv...

     ...and sweeps it over the belly of the beast. HOWLING, the
     predator falls, disemboweled.

     REACTION SHOTS of Fry and Imam. Stunned.

                              RIDDICK
               Didn't know who he was fuckin' with.

     They regroup. Imam's head swivels back and forth: They're one
     person short.

                              IMAM
               Suleiman!

                              RIDDICK
               Get the girl back under. Keep going.

                              IMAM
               SULEIMAN!

                              RIDDICK
               KEEP GOING OR I WILL!

     Suddenly Pilgrim #1 reappears, thrust back into the light by
     unseen forces. He's still alive -- but shouldn't be. He makes
     a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam, to anyone, but he's gone
     again before they can even react, jerked out of the light. Out
     of existence.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     They flail on. And now, finally...finally....

     The canyon widens, opening up like some door to Heaven. The
     WORST SOUNDS fall behind. We can see it in their sweat-sheened
     faces: The faintest hope that maybe they've survived the Seventh
     Circle of Hell. But then...

     The TORCHES SPIT AND SPUTTER.

     Audrey hears PATTERING on the metal shield.

     Blood falls anew.

     One torch dies -- yet somehow comes back to life.

     Imam upturns a hand, checking the liquid for color. But this
     blood has no hue.

                              FRY
               Oh, no. No, no, no....

                              IMAM
               Rain.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     RAIN MONTAGE: Water rilling, running, flowing over rocks and
     ground.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Caught in a downpour, the survivors slog to a stop. One torch
     goes out -- and won't relight.

                              RIDDICK
               So where the hell's God now, huh?
                         (no answer from Imam)
               I'll tell you where! He's up there
               PISSING ON ME!

                              FRY
               Riddick? How close?

     Riddick sheds goggles to look ahead. We don't know what he
     sees -- nor what he's thinking.

                              FRY
               Tell me the settlement is right there!
               RIDDICK, PLEASE!

                              RIDDICK
               We can't make it.

     HOLD on Fry's anguished face, rendered in dying torchlight.
     Somewhere behind, the AWFUL SOUNDS RETURN.

                              RIDDICK
               Here...hide here....

     He's found a crevice in the canyon wall.

                              RIDDICK
               Inside...inside....


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     They crawl into the fissure. The second torch dies behind them.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     There's just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his
     back. By its glow, we watch him lift the shield, muscle it over
     to the crevice...


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     ...and slide it over the opening. A black beat.

                              AUDREY
                         (a beat)
               Why's he still out there?

     Fry's not sure. Is he protecting them? Or entombing them?


     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Working like Sisyphus, Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise.
     He stops at the top, peers through the rain.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of the settlement.

     Riddick disappears over the rise. The four cells follow,
     slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

                              AUDREY
               He's not coming back, is he?

     Fry checks Imam's face. Did Riddick say anything to you?" Imam
     wags his head. A bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she can see
     his face.

                              FRY
               There's light in here.

     It's a soft glow from above. Imam climbs higher to discover
     small blue-white lights clinging to rocks. He plucks a few.

                              FRY
               What are they?

     CLOSE on the lights in Imam's palm. They writhe with life.

                              IMAM
               Larva....

                              AUDREY
               Glow worms....

                              FRY
                         (mind racing)
               How many bottles we got? Empty ones?


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Riddick boards the dark craft.

     Connects the power cells to the battery bay.

     Watches the ship come to life.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a liquor bottle. It's half full of glow-worms.

                              AUDREY
               More, more, we need more....

     They climb higher. Little by little, the bottle brightens their
     world.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff,
     looking out into dark rain. Is he struggling with a decision?
     Or just savoring the safe harbor? Then very deliberately...

     Riddick smashes his handlight on the hull. He steps inside and
     closes the hatch behind him.


     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Something claws its way up the rise. Standing, we see that it's
     Fry, a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck. Ahead she
     spies...

     The settlement. Silhouetted by engine-light.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     As the skiffs ENGINES WARM UP.


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     As Riddick dabbles with flight controls.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     As Fry, running, splashes past buildings.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Audrey and Imam huddle around a bottle of glow-worms: This is
     all they could harvest. Presently SCRABBLING SOUNDS on the
     shield. Imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield. He
     can't see much until...

     A blade rushes through the hole. Imam recoils hard, snatches up
     the glow-worm light to see...

     More predator blades exploring the edges of the shield. The
     light drives them away. For now.


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Riddick dims interior lights, activates exterior lights. He's
     actually startled by the sight of...

     Fry. Standing in the skiffs headbeams. Daring him to run her
     over.

     Eye-lock.

     Riddick opens the hatch.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     They meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- Fry in the rain,
     Riddick in the light.

                              RIDDICK
               Strong survival instinct. Admire that in
               a woman.

                              FRY
               You're not leaving. Not until we go back
               for the others.

     He laughs at that.

                              FRY (CONT'D)
               I promised them we'd go back with more
               light. And that's exactly what we're
               gonna do..

                              RIDDICK
               Think you've mistaken me for somebody who
               gives a fuck.

                              FRY
               What, you're afraid?

                              RIDDICK
               Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was
               his monkey. I only deal in life and
               death. All that stuff in between? Some
               shade of grey my eyes don't see.

                              FRY
               I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I
               trusted that some part of you wanted to
               rejoin the human race.

                              RIDDICK
               Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.

     Fry realizes it's impossible to shame a shameless man. With
     desperation edging her voice:

                              FRY
               Then wait for me. I'll go back myself.
               Just give me more light for them.

     He tosses her a light. The broken one.

                              FRY
               Just come with me!

                              RIDDICK
               Got a better idea. Come with me.

     Fry's mouth moves but nothing comes out.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               They're already dead. Get on board.

                              FRY
               You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.

                              RIDDICK
               'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't
               leave you here. If you believe anything
               about me, better be that.

                              FRY
               No, you see, I promised them...I have
               to...I have to go and....

     She's bleeding resolve. Riddick can see it -- can smell it --
     and he keeps slashing away.

                              RIDDICK
               Step aboard, Carolyn.

                              FRY
                         (tortured)
               I can't....I can't....

                              RIDDICK
                         (approaching, extending
                          a hand)
               Here. Make it easy on you.

                              FRY
               Don't do this to me....

                              RIDDICK
               Just give me your hand.

                              FRY
               But they...they could still be....

                              RIDDICK
               No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my
               hand and save yourself, Carolyn.

     A beat. She takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway.
     They sprawl through mud. She gets a knee on his neck.

                              FRY
               I will not give up on them! I Will not
               leave anyone on this rock with those
               fucking things, even if it means --

     In a blur, Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck. Is
     history repeating itself? Riddick's face, though, is strangely
     calm. Curious. Even gentle.

                              RIDDICK
               You'd die for them?

                              FRY
               I would try for them.

                              RIDDICK
               You barely know them.

                              FRY
               But I'm human. I know you view that as a
               weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear,
               theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes.
               I would die for them.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     MORE SCRABBLING at the shield. Imam cocks his blade back, ready
     to do battle with...

     Fry. She heaves the shield aside. Behind her, Riddick.

                              AUDREY
                         (big-eyed)
               You came for us....

                              RIDDICK
               Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed.
               Anyone not ready for this?


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Protected by the meager light of two glow-worm bottles, the four
     remaining survivors head out.

                              RIDDICK
               Tighter, tighter....


     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

                              RIDDICK
               Stop.

     They pile up awkwardly. Fry listens hard. Only RAINFALL.

                              FRY
               I don't hear --

     He covers her mouth.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise.
     A predator drinks there.

                              RIDDICK
                         (on his breath)
               Doesn't see us...wait for it to leave....

     RIDDICK'S POV: Another predator lands to drink. Then another.
     Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major
     gathering place.

     Soon they all can hear CLICKING above the RAIN. Their nightmare
     is far from over.

                              RIDDICK
               Get behind me.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the
     pool. A slim gap appears.

                              RIDDICK
               When I go, we go. Full-throttle.

     CLOSE on their hands, gripping each other.

                              RIDDICK
               Ready...ready....

     RIDDICK'S POV: The gap between predators widens into a passage.
     A gauntlet within a gauntlet.

     Riddick runs. Linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of a predator turning to "stare" over its
     shoulder.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick bearing down fast.

     The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing
     through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to
     reach...

     The muddy rise. Audrey loses her grip on the others...

     And starts back-sliding. She CRIES OUT, turning the head of...

     Riddick. He catches Audrey as her legs hit the pool. He muscles
     her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her
     slip-sliding down the other side.

                              RIDDICK
               You know the way!

     Not waiting for him, Fry and Imam disappear over the rise.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of the predators. Regrouping. Crawling up the
     rise at us.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Fry, Imam, and Audrey run hard, glow-worm lights bouncing wildly.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Chasing them.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Chasing Riddick.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     Fry, Imam, and Audrey reach the settlement. They spill around a
     corner and see...

     The light of the skiff.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     RIDDICK'S POV: Ahead of us, we see Fry, Imam, and Audrey
     vanishing around the corner. BREATHING LIKE A RACEHORSE, we
     follow in their steps, storming around the same corner. Suddenly
     a predator is right there, right in our face.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick skidding to a stop. He snaps a look
     up.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of another predator perched gargoyle-like on the
     building. It SPEED-CLICKS at us.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick slowly pulling two shivs. Bracing
     himself. Ready to blade it out.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Imam and Audrey stagger aboard. Safe in the light of the
     headbeams, Fry turns back, panting, waiting.

     Waiting.

                              IMAM
               Captain....

     He wants her to board the skiff. Fry gives it another beat, eyes
     sweeping the dark rain. And just when we think it's over for
     Riddick -- TERRIBLE SCREAMS are heard from both man and predator:
     There's a helluva fight going on out there. Close out there.

     Fry snatches the glow-worms off Imam's neck...

     And plunges into the darkness, homing in on the SOUNDS until...

     A blade flashes in her face. She ducks and spots...

     Riddick. Bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to
     fight off the shadow-beasts that swirl and slash all around him.
     Around them both.

                              FRY
               It's me, it's me, it's me!

     She gets the light around his neck. Now we see his face
     clearly -- and see a very human expression there: Fear. Fry
     grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up.

                              FRY
               C'mon, Riddick -- said I'd die for them,
               not you.

     He gets his feet under him. Gripping each other, they start
     moving, turning like dancers in a macabre waltz, hoping the
     predators can't fix on Riddick's blood.

                              FRY
               Just 10 steps...keep turning, keep
               turning...that's right...others're already
               'board, waitin' for us right now...five
               steps...c'mon, almost there, Riddick...
               almost there...we're almost --

     Something jolts them. ALL CLICKING STOPS.

     EXTREME CLOSEUPS: Searching each other's eyes. Someone just got
     slashed from behind, slashed bad. But who?

                              RIDDICK
               Not for me....

     In an eyeblink she's gone, ripped from his arms. There was no
     scream. No cry. No final words. Just...

     Blackness.


     EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NIGHT

     Out of the blackness, a spot of fire races toward us. It
     resolves into the skiff, fabric wings burning off as it hits
     escape velocity.


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a bloody hand. It toggles through nav-charts, plots a
     rendezvous with "Sol-Track 17B" shipping lane.

     In the cockpit, Riddick finds Audrey beside him. She stares
     hypnotically at the stars ahead.

                              RIDDICK
               Probably okay to talk to me now.

                              AUDREY
               Not sure where to go. I was just runnin'
               away when this whole thing started.
                         (a beat)
               Where you goin'?

                              RIDDICK
               Not sure. I was just runnin' away when
               this whole thing....

     Interior smiles. Stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes
     a course-correction. One very bright star comes into view.

                              RIDDICK
               Might interest you....

     Imam moves forward. Seeing, his face lifts.

                              IMAM
               New Mecca....

                              RIDDICK
               Think a soul could get lost there? With
               all those pilgrim-types?

                              IMAM
               It's more a place where souls are found,
               Mr. Riddick.

     As Riddick ponders the possibilities, we CUT TO...


     EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NEW DAWN

     The first sun flares out from behind the eclipsing planet. Its
     light feels cleansing. Renewing. Life-giving.

                                                            FADE OUT
PITCH BLACK

                                             3/3/98








     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS
     AND SOME "OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS

     TO PREFORMATTED TEXT FOR THIS SOFT COPY.









Though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in PITCH BLACK are 
seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are 
felt. They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling 
coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life
when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake 
hits. Chimera of the night. The point is made so the reader appreciates
that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, 
but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters. 
For PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and 
lack of the same.



                                                       David Twohy








     CUT IN:

     INT. MAIN CABIN

     A CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN, spitting out...

     CAROLYN FRY. She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew
     lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. But the
     deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere:
     The world is dying around her.

     Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the
     next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE
     is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But
     in the next cryo-locked...

     The CAPTAIN is struggling awake. Fry's face floods with relief.
     Slapping an intercom:

                              FRY
               Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to
               the hull...holding for now, but...Goddamn,
               I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your
               E-release...no, red handle, red handle.
               I'll get the warm-ups out while --

     PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT: Particles bore through the cabin,
     blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING
     INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS
     HISSING in the air.

     Fry lands on her ass, horrified. Suddenly...

     Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right on top of Fry --
     but this one's still alive. Disoriented, frantic:

                              OWENS
               Why did I fall on you?

                              FRY
               He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was
               looking right at him when --

                              OWENS
               I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22
               weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to
               kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean,
               I mean, why did I fall at all?

                              FRY
               You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.

                              OWENS
               Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai',
               wait. I'm Owens. Right?

     They swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure of their own
     identities.

                              FRY
               Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs
               brain cells.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

     They stumble into nav-bay. ALARMS CONTINUE. Fry grabs warm-up
     suits out of storage, pitches one to Owens, checks her screens.

                              FRY
               1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute,
               shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin'
               took a swipe at us.

                              OWENS
               Just tell me we're still in the shipping
               lane. Just show me all those stars, all
               those bright, beautiful, deep-space....

     Owens activates an exterior view: A planet rushes up at us.
     That's why they have gravity.

                              FRY
               Jesus God....


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     The SHIP PLOWS through the upper atmosphere, antennae pylons
     already disintegrating.


     INT. PASSAGE TO FLIGHT DECK

     Heart battering her ribs, Fry runs forward, using hand-holds to
     steady herself. Over a headset:

                              OWENS (V.O.)
               They trained you for this, right? Fry?
               FRY?

     She doesn't answer.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Fry harnesses in, starts running switches -- but fumbles a few
     times, making mental errors. Finally she gets crash-shutters
     open to reveal...

     CLOUD STRATA sweeping up past the windscreen like floor-lights
     on a dropping elevator. We're shedding big altitude.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

                              OWENS
               ... crisis program selected Number Two of
               this system because it shows at least some
               oxygen and more than 1,500 -- would you
               SHUT THE FUCK UP!
                         (hammers a button,
                          SILENCES ALARMS)
               -- more than 1,500-millibars of pressure
               at surface-level. Okay, so maybe the ship
               did something right for a change....


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     As Fry runs more switches.


     INT. SHIP - DAY

     As JETTISON DOORS CLOSE around the ship.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     As Fry flips up a security-latch -- and thumbs the switch below.


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     MULTIPLE SHOTS: EXPLOSIVE BOLTS RAPID-FIRE around the ship's
     skin, blowing away non-essentials that hinder aerodynamics --
     including big deep-space drives. But this last separation puts
     the ship into a dangerous roll.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Out the windscreen, cloud strata roll vertiginously. Fry throws
     actuators...


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     And airbrakes deploy. She manages to kill the roll. But the
     ship's still coming in nose-high.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

                              OWENS
               ...showing no major water bodies...maximum
               terrain, 220 meters over mean surface...
               largely cinder and gypsum with some
               evaporite deposits....

     JETTISON DOORS CLOSE behind Owens, segregating him from the
     passenger compartment. It scares him for a new reason.

                              OWENS
               Fry? What're you doing?


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Fry flips up a new security-latch. INTERCUTTING:

                              OWENS
               Fry?

                              FRY
               Can't get my nose down...too much load
               back there....

                              OWENS
               You mean that "load" of passengers?

                              FRY
               So what, we should both go down too?
               Out of sheer fucking nobility?

     Tortured silence. Fry's thumb moves to the switch that will
     jettison the passenger cabin. Jettison 50 people.


     INT. MAIN CABIN

     SELECTED SHOTS of faces inside cryo-lockers, among them JOHNS.
     He's prime-of-life, badge on display, some kind of cop. Shaken
     awake, he clears condensation to check the locker directly across
     from his, finding...

     RIDDICK. Small black goggles hide his eyes. A metal bit wedged
     in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace. A read-out admonishes
     "LOCK-OUT PROTOCOL IN EFFECT. ABSOLUTELY NO EARLY
     RELEASE."


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

                              OWENS
               Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible
               for every one of those --

                              FRY
               Company's not here, is it?

                              OWENS
               When captain went down, you stepped up --
               whether you like it or not. Now they
               train you for this, so --

                              FRY
               And there wasn't a simulated cockroach
               alive within 50 clicks of the simulated
               crash site! That's how they train you!
               On a fucking simulator!

     Owens unbuckles from his chair.

                              OWENS
               Don't touch that switch!

     Overcome by guilt, Fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction.
     But a HUGE JOLT puts the thumb right back.

                              FRY
               I'm not dying for them.

     She pushes it. But this time...


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     No bolts fire. Nothing separates from the SHIP THAT SCREAMS DOWN
     through the clouds.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

     Now we see why: Owens reopened the jettison doors locally -- and
     blocked them open.

                              FRY
               Owens!

                              OWENS
               70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to
               level this beast out!


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Seething anger and guilt, Fry pops more airbrakes, shedding more
     speed, more heat. The ship does level -- but it's still being
     pounded hellishly. She tries to get a stable view out...

     The windscreen. We're breaking through cloud-bottoms. There's
     just a glimpse of landscape before...


     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

     An airbrake fails. It shears off and pinwheels into...


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     The windscreen. It cracks into a thousand spiderwebs -- but
     impossibly it holds. For now.

                              OWENS (V.O.)
               What the shit was that?

     Sunlight flares from every fractured edge: It's like looking
     into burning diamonds, and Fry can only get an impression
     of the outside world. Now she has to rely on...

     A ground-mapping display. 120 meters altitude. And dropping.


     INT. CRYO-LOCKER - DAY

     INTERCUT Johns. Realizing he's in some kind of shit-storm, he
     claws at safety restraints.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Ground-mapper: 60 meters. COLLISION ALARMS kick in.

     Out the fractured windscreen, we see a huge dark mass rise up
     into view. Land.

     40 meters...30...20...10....

     Fry braces.

     IMPACT. The WINDSCREENS IMPLODE. AIR HURRICANES in.


     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN

     IMPACT. Chairs rip from their moorings. Strapped into one,
     Owens slams into the ceiling.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - DAY

     IMPACT. Johns BLOWS OUT of his locker -- and wishes to God he
     would've stayed inside, because just beside him...

     The hull is cracking open.

     NIGHTMARE SHOT: A huge section of the cabin tears free...
     skitters and CRASHES along the planetfloor behind us...and
     disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it.
     40 lives.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY

     Hammered by WIND, Fry opens her eyes experimentally.

     FRY'S POV: A vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris.
     But the ship is burrowing in. Burrowing under.

     Fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before...
     Dirt avalanches into the cockpit. It buries CAMERA.

                                                       BLACKOUT


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Choking yellow dust. Ghostly silhouettes are COUGHING, MOANING,
     CALLING OUT to other survivors in English and, surreally, in
     Arabic. Soon we find...

     Johns. Ears running blood. Stumbling his way to...

     Riddick's cryo-locker. Empty. Johns reaches for his holster.
     Gone, torn right off his belt. No prisoner and no weapon --
     spooky combination. Nearby he sees...

     The light of a cutting torch. Someone's using it to open a
     jammed cryo-locker. The plexi is torched away to reveal...

     AUDREY, 12 years old. Unscathed.

                              AUDREY
               Somethin' went wrong, huh?

     Johns searches for his pistol. Behind him, two chained feet
     lower into FRAME -- and then attack, swinging over Johns' head...
     getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as
     a choke-collar. Johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at...

     Riddick. Still in body chains and mouth-bit. Clinging to a
     ceiling support. Riding out the baton blows.

     Seconds from blacking out, Johns strains forward...forward...and
     finally breaks Riddick's grip on the support. He keeps hold of
     the chained feet so that...

     Riddick SLAMS HEADFIRST into the deck. Johns lays the baton on
     his neck.

                              JOHNS
               One chance and you blew it, Riddick.
               Never cease to disappoint me.


     INT. FLIGHT DECK - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Darkness. A light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit.
     It's packed with dirt, no signs of life. About to search
     elsewhere, Johns turns back at...

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Hey.

                              JOHNS
               Hey, who?

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Hey, me. Over here.

     His light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt. Johns
     crawls closer, checks the other side of the headrest and finds
     her. Fry. Buried to the gills.

                              JOHNS
               Amazing. I'm Johns.

                              FRY
               Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...

     He manages a smile and starts digging her out. Almost dreading
     to ask:

                              FRY
               Are there any others, Johns?


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Johns helps Fry through the carnage. She's stunned by it all --
     but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be.

     Realizing she's in nav-bay, Fry starts digging like a search dog
     to uncover...

     Owens. Still strapped to his chair. Metal rod piercing his
     chest close to the heart. Dead. Fry reaches out to touch him.

                              OWENS
               Out, out, out, GET IT OUTTA ME!

     She recoils hard. He's still alive. The other survivors bungle
     over. Ten seconds of pure chaos:

                              VOICES
               Pull it out of him...No, it's too close to
               the heart...You gotta do it, just do it
               fast....

     Fry grabs the rod.

                              OWENS
               Don't touch it! Don't touch that switch!

                              VOICES
               You'll kill him, I'm tellin' you, shit,
               just leave it alone...delirious...doncha
               you got some drugs for this poor man....

                              OWENS
               Don't touch that switch!

                              FRY
               Awright, awright, someone...there's
               Anestaphine in the med-lock, that end of
               the cabin...next to....

     But there is no more "that end." In exquisite pain, Owens
     screams on. REACTION SHOTS of Johns, Audrey. Seldom are human
     beings witness to such raw suffering.

                              FRY
               Get away. Everybody.

     The others leave -- except for Audrey, staying behind to watch
     in morbid fascination. Johns doubles back and collars her.
     Leaving, they pass...

     Riddick, cuffed to a bulkhead. His eyes, still hidden by
     goggles, track Johns and Audrey toward daylight.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     The survivors straggle outside. CAMERA SURVEYS new faces:

     ZEKE and SHAZZA. Male-female team of bushwhackers, partners in
     life. Shazza has a tough sexiness. Zeke's face shows aboriginal
     blood. (30s.)

     PARIS. Overfed, overgroomed. A puff pastry of a man. (40s or
     50s.)

     Four male "Chrislams": The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish), and
     THREE PILGRIMS, young and excitable (late-teens). (NOTE: The
     Chrislams represent a union between Christianity and Islam. They
     have the iconography of Christians yet the physical look of Arab
     Muslims.)

     WIDE SHOT: All around them is stark and unforgiving terrain.
     The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side,
     spiked with earthen spires. Scorching down on everything are
     two suns -- one red, one yellow.

                              PARIS
               Well. Our own little slice of heaven.

     The Chrislams fall to their knees. Confusion as they try to
     orient themselves.

                              IMAM
               Please...which way to New Mecca? We must
               know the direction in order to pray.

     North? South? East? West? Nobody knows. Johns snaps open a
     compass, finds the needle swaying rudderlessly. The SCREAMING
     inside the ship finally ends.


     INT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     As Fry holds Owens, now dead.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     The four Chrislams have devised a way to pray: Backs together,
     each faces a different compass point.


     EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Fry climbs onto the back of the ship. Johns Paris, Zeke, Shazza,
     Audrey are already here.

                              JOHNS
               Big talk about a scouting party...

     Fry sees the huge smoldering scar in the ground behind the ship.
     One glance confirms that there are no other survivors.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               ...then we saw this.

                              PARIS
               Anyone else having breathing problems?
               Aside from me?

                              AUDREY
               Like I just ran, or something....

                              SHAZZA
               Feel one lung short. All of us.

                              PARIS
               Well, I tend toward the asthmatic. And
               with all this dust....

     Faces turn to Fry: They're looking to her for answers.

                              FRY
               It's the atmosphere. Too much pressure,
               not enough oxygen. Might take a few days
               to --

                              ZEKE
               So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?

                              FRY
               Somethin' knocked us off-lane. Maybe a
               rogue comet. Maybe we'll never know.

                              SHAZZA
               Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking
               grateful. This beast wasn't made to land
               like this. But cripes, you rode it down.
                         (to others)
               C'mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason
               we're alive is a'cuzza her.

     Others CHIME AGREEMENT, laying thankful hands on Fry's shoulders.
     HOLD on Fry, her face betraying nothing as they anoint her their
     savior.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Breaking out pressure suits:

                              FRY
               Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start
               ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try
               to make it last.

                              AUDREY
               Well, is someone coming for us? Or are
               we all just gonna die of exposure or
               dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even
               something worse?
                         (off their looks)
               Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring
               me.

                              SHAZZA
               We're worried you'll scare us.
                         (ushering her away)
               Name's "Audrey," right, love? And you're
               goin' to Taurus Three like we were?

                              AUDREY
               Yeah, but...do we even have enough food
               to get there? Or will we have to resort
               to cannibalism?

                              ZEKE
                         (to Fry)
               I'll see 'bout makin' this air go a bit
               further, cap'n. With your permission,
               a' course.

     Fry blinks. "They actually think I'm the captain." Zeke and the
     others get to work. Fry finds herself staring at another
     problem. Riddick.

                              FRY
               And him?

                              JOHNS
               Big Evil?

                              FRY
               We just keep him locked up forever?

                              JOHNS
               Be my choice. Already escaped once from
               the max-slam facility on --

                              FRY
               I don't need his life story. Is he really
               that dangerous?

                              JOHNS
               Only around humans.

     Riddick has his mouth on the hull, virtually licking the metal.
     Fry moves closer -- and now sees it sheeting down the hull.

                              FRY
               Oh, Christ....

     They're losing water. Suddenly Fry is running, snatching up an
     emergency light, climbing wall-rungs...


     INT. MACHINE LEVEL - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     And crawling through dusty superstructure to reach the water
     cistern. She opens a crank-hatch -- and finds light invading the
     interior. Her face dies.

                              ZEKE (V.O.)
                         (shouting)
               Well? Is it just the pump?

                              FRY
               Ask if anyone has anything in cargo!
               Anything to drink!


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     Oversize DOORS RUMBLE open. Fry, Johns, and Paris climb into
     this dark corridor lined with cargo containers. Each container
     has an access door.

                              PARIS
               Mine here....

     As Paris unlocks, Johns steadies himself, suddenly light-headed.

                              FRY
               S'matter?

                              JOHNS
               Little swamp-flu from the Conga system.
               Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.

     Paris opens his container to reveal...


     INT. PARIS' CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - DAY

     Tiffany chairs stacked 10 high. Bronze eagle lecterns. Oriental
     umbrellas. Neo-Egyptian castings.

                              JOHNS
               King Tut's tomb....

                              PARIS
               Be surprised what these will fetch in the
               Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here --
               easy, easy. Very rare.

     They open the Wooten desk. Cubbyholed inside are dusty bottles
     of sherry. Vintage Port. Glenfiddich. Bicardi 151.

                              FRY
               This is it? Booze? That's what you have
               to drink?

                              PARIS
                         (educating her)
               200-year-old single-malt scotch is to
               "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."

                              JOHNS
                         (cracking a bottle)
               A toast to whatever he just said.

                              PARIS
               I'll need a receipt for that.
                         (to Fry)
               For all these.

                              FRY
               Top of my list.

     She joins Johns for a drink. Entering, the Chrislams watch with
     both envy and aversion.

                              FRY
               I don't suppose....

                              IMAM
               One of the Christian habits we didn't
               adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. We'll
               have to wait.

                              JOHNS
               For what? There is no water. You
               understand that, don't you?

                              IMAM
               All deserts have water, somewhere. God
               shall lead us there.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     START on the cutting torch, abandoned in wreckage. Staring at it
     is...

     Riddick. With his hands cuffed behind him and around a bulkhead,
     he can't get near it. Or can he? Near the ceiling, the bulkhead
     is fractured -- a slim spot where maybe chains could pass through.

     Riddick stands. With a GRUESOME POPPING, he dislocates both
     shoulders...carries his arms overhead...passes the chains through
     the broken spot...and brings his arms down in front of him. A
     body-flex POPS HIS SHOULDERS back into joint.

     Free, he reaches for the cutting torch.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Pistol in hand, Johns runs into a BIG CLOSEUP, eyes sweeping.
     Nothing on the horizon. But something lies on the ground nearby.
     It's Riddick's mouth-bit.

                              JOHNS
               Like we needed another way to die.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     FAST CLOSEUPS: Hands pillaging storage lockers, pulling out
     anything that might qualify as a "weapon." It all gets hauled
     back and dumped into...

     INT. NAV BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Nav-bay. Gathered, the survivors take inventory: Johns has a
     pistol, shotgun, baton. Zeke and Shazza offer up a pick-ax,
     digging tools, hunting boomerang. Imam shows a ceremonial blade.
     Paris straggles in with antique curios.

                              JOHNS
               What the hell are these?

                              PARIS
               Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern
               India. Very rare.

                              ZEKE
               An' this?

                              PARIS
               Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New
               Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe's
               extinct.

                              ZEKE
               'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these
               things, be my guess.

                              PARIS
               Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's
               gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?

                              JOHNS
               First, because he can only live out there
               for so long -- he's gonna come back and
               take what we got. Second, for the sheer
               thrill of the kill.

     A beat. They all grab for weapons.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Johns stands atop the crash ship, scanning with a scope. He
     fixates on...

     A blue glow on the horizon. "What the hell is it?"

     Zeke and Shazza modify breather units, adding straps and tubing
     and ball-floats. The prototype is tested on Audrey. She sucks
     on the mouthpiece -- and finds that it works, supplying oxygen on
     demand rather than in a constant flow.

     Chrislams convert to traditional bedouin head-gear, readying for
     travel.

     Fry finishes wrapping Owens' body. She looks to the yellow sun,
     low on the horizon. The red sun seems inclined to follow.

                              FRY
               Imam. We should leave soon. Before
               nightfall but while it's cooler.

                              ZEKE
               What, you're goin' off, too?

                              FRY
               Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a
               favor, huh? Get my crewies buried? They
               were good guys who died bad.

                              SHAZZA
               A'course we will.

                              PILGRIM #1 (O.S.)
               Imam...Imam....

     (NOTE: "Imam" is pronounced "el-ee-MAM.")

     Fry and the others round the ship to see...

     A blue star flaring into view. It's rising as the other suns are
     setting.

                              SHAZZA
               My bloody oath....

                              AUDREY
               Three suns?

                              ZEKE
                         (to Fry)
               So much for your nightfall.

                              PARIS
               So much for my cocktail hour.

                              IMAM
               We take this to be a good sign -- a path,
               a direction from God.

     Johns swings down from the top of the ship.

                              JOHNS
               A very good sign.
                         (re: blue sun)
               That's Riddick's direction. You do not
               wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.

                              FRY
               Thought you found his restraints over
               there. Toward sunset.

                              JOHNS
                         (nodding)
               Which means he went toward sunrise.


     EXT. PLANET - DAY

     Trekking, the Chrislams waft incense pots and CHANT FROM
     THE KORAN as they head toward the blue star. Johns provides
     shotgun escort; Fry carries Paris' second war-pick on a shoulder.
     Silhouetted against the alien sky, the scouting party is an odd,
     odd sight.

     Already sun-battered, Johns crafts an eye-visor out of plexi.
     Fry tries to wrap her head like the Chrislams. Imam helps.

                              FRY
               So quiet. You get used to the sounds of
               the ship, then....

                              IMAM
               You know who Muhammad was?

                              FRY
               Some prophet guy?

                              IMAM
               "Some prophet guy." And a city man. But
               he had to travel to the desert -- where
               there was quiet -- to hear the words of
               God.

                              FRY
               You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?

                              IMAM
                         (nodding)
               Chrislam teaches that once in every
               lifetime should there be a great hajj --
               a great pilgrimage. To know God, better,
               yes, but to know yourself as well.

                              FRY
               Frightening thought.

                              IMAM
                         (finishes wrapping her)
               We're all on the same hajj now.

     Fry notices Johns scope-locked on something.

                              FRY
               What?

                              JOHNS
                         (hands her scope)
               Tell me it's not a mirage.

     SCOPE POV: Beyond a distant rise, strange branches.

                              FRY
               Trees?


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Paris has taken over as look-out atop the ship. He deals with
     the heat by erecting a "misting" umbrella: He fills a reservoir
     with liquor, dials up a regulator. Umbrella spars shoot bursts
     of cooling alcohol vapor. Paris luxuriates in it.

                              ZEKE (O.S.)
               Comfy up there?

     Zeke appears below. He loads a scrap-metal sled with tarp,
     cable, pick-ax.

                              PARIS
               Amazing how you can do without the
               essentials of life -- so long as you have
               the luxuries.

                              ZEKE
               Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes
               open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up
               on me bloody-fuckin' arse.

     He drags the sled toward the spired hills. Keeping one eye on
     Zeke, Paris eases into a chair, lays the war-pick across his lap,
     pours himself a spot of sherry. As he sips, a blade touches his
     throat.

                              AUDREY
               He'd probably get you right here, right
               under the jaw. And you'd never hear him
               coming. That's how good Riddick is.

     Paris eases the hunting boomerang away.

                              PARIS
               Now did you run away from your parents?
               Or did they run away from you?

     EXT. BONEYARD OVERLOOK - DAY

     The scouting party approaches a rise. The trees loom just beyond.

                              PILGRIMS
               Allahu Akbar...Allahu Akbar....

     The young pilgrims break into a excited run, anticipating an
     oasis. But Fry hangs back, taking a harder look at the trees.
     They don't move in the wind.

     The pilgrims scramble up the rise -- and go motionless. Fry,
     Johns and Imam catch up to behold...

     The "trees" are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton,
     tinted green by lichen. Beyond is a sea of bleached animal
     bones. Impossibly, the bones seem to MOAN IN PAIN. All told,
     it's like Hell overflowed right here.

                              FRY
               Is this whole planet dead?

     A pilgrim questions Imam IN ARABIC.

                              IMAM
               He asks what could have killed so many
               great things...
         

     EXT. BONEYARD - DAY

     Moving into the boneyard:

                              IMAM
               Some...communal graveyard, perhaps...
               like the elephants of Earth....

     Fry touches one of the towering bones. It shows cut-marks --
     almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword. "Graveyard? Or
     killing field?"

                              JOHNS
               Long time ago. Whatever happened.


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Pilgrim #1 reaches a huge skull laced with baleen-like combing.
     Wind hitting the comb makes a LOW HARMONIC MOANING. By
     moving a hand over the comb, the pilgrim can "play" DIRGELIKE
     MUSIC. Wanting to show off the trick:

                              PILGRIM #1
               Ah....

     He looks for Pilgrim #3 but can't spot him. And when he turns
     back to the skull -- a face is staring through the combing. But
     it's only...


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Pilgrim #3, inside the skull. Johns enters and chases him out.
     About to leave, Johns notices...

     Bone-chippings piled on the ground. It could be nothing, but
     still...

     Johns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his
     shotgun. Satisfied, Johns exits. Now BOOM UP to reveal...

     Riddick. Hidden in a sinus cavity.


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Trailing the others, Fry pauses to change out the O2 on her
     breather.


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Riddick drops to the ground. His arms and hands are now pierced
     with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons.
     Spotting a shadow on the combing, he draws closer. And sees Fry.
     Alone.


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Johns doubles back to Fry. He takes a hit of scotch, offers her
     some.

                              FRY
               Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you
               even more.

                              JOHNS
               Probably right.

     They drink anyway. Moving out of the sun, Fry leans up against
     the combing. It brings her within arm's length of...


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Riddick. He pulls a bone-shiv, freshly chiseled.

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               You know, I woulda played road dog for
               these guys. You could've stayed back.
               Pro'bly should've -- because, you know,
               if we don't find water....

     "We may not make it back."

                              FRY (O.S.)
               No, no, I wanted to get away.

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               So I noticed. Never seen a "captain"
               quite so ready to leave her ship.

     Just as Riddick eases his blade toward Fry's neck...


     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     She steps away.

                              FRY
               Better keep moving....

                              JOHNS
               What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching
               the switch?

     Fry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and
     again she leans back on the combing. We can actually see Riddick
     now. They could too, if they would just TURN THE FUCK AROUND!

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.

                              FRY
               Promise me. Swear to me you won't --

                              JOHNS
               You see anybody else here? Just between
               you and me.

                              FRY
               During the landing...when things were
               at their worst...Owens was at his best.
               He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot
               dump the passenger cabin.

     Johns blinks, stunned. "Are you shittin' me?"


     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY

     Trying again, Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly
     slices off some of Fry's hair. A locket. A souvenir. That's
     all he wanted.

                              FRY (O.S.)
               So now you know.

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than
               I thought.

     Riddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle,
     left behind. It's still got one good swallow.


     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - DAY

     Leaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the
     hills. Ahead is a canyon.

                              JOHNS
               Hold up.

     He jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Didn't bite.

                              FRY
               What?

                              JOHNS
               Thought he might be coolin' it in the
               boneyard -- could either double-back to
               the ship or slip in behind us. So I left
               the bottle out as bait.

     SCOPE POV: PANNING the boneyard. FINDING the bottle. It's
     still got that one swallow.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               But nah. Didn't bite.


     EXT. BONEYARD - DAY

     CLOSER on the bottle. Only we see that the scotch has been
     emptied -- and replaced with sand.


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     Working under the shade of a tarp, Zeke digs a communal grave.
     Three wrapped corpses wait nearby. He keeps a sight-line on...

     The crash ship. Shazza waves. Zeke waves back.


     EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY

     The scouting party transits a narrowing canyon. Lined with rib
     bones, it makes us feel like we're in the belly of some beast.

     Fry squints at the ridgetops. More of those spires are visible
     on the canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels. "What are
     they? Just mineral deposits?"

                              PILGRIM #1
               Captain...captain....

     The Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant.
     Leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core.
     ARABIC DISCUSSION. Desert fruit? Is it edible?

                              FRY
               Wait, wait, wait....

     Fry takes the "plant," pushes the "petals" back down over the
     core. They all stare. It's a baseball.

                              IMAM
               We are not alone here, yes?

     They look ahead, wondering what awaits them. But Johns is
     looking back.

                              JOHNS
               Never thought we were.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     HIGH ANGLE: An old WEATHER COCK CREAKS in the wind. Fry,
     Johns, and the Chrislams enter FRAME far below.

                              PILGRIM #1
               Assalamoo ahlaykum!

     The GREETING ECHOES through the settlement, built from stacked
     shipping containers. Tattered sun-shades flap in the wind. A
     rusty bike lies on the ground.

                              PILGRIM #2
               Assalamoo ahlaykum!

                              JOHNS
               Long gone. Whoever they were.

     They move around a building -- and pull up short. Before them
     looms a moisture-recovery unit, a hulking machine in disrepair.
     Old jugs litter the ground.

                              IMAM
               Water...water there was here....

                              PILGRIMS
               Allahu Akbar....


                              IMAM
                         (translating)
               "God is Great," yes?

                              JOHNS
               I'm born-again.

     Fry manages a weary smile -- but soon her eyes revisit the
     abandoned buildings. "Who were these people? Why did they
     leave so much behind?"


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Through a window, we see the Johns and the Chrislams crawling
     over the moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs. PULL BACK to
     include Fry inside the settlement, inspecting...

     Refectory table. Place settings out. Years of dust.

     Photos on the wall: Settlers working modest gardens. Playing
     baseball. Posing with children.

     INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Fry enters a dark room.

                              FRY
               Lights.

     No response to her command. She pats around for old-style wall
     switches. Nothing. Perceiving black-out blinds on a window, she
     throws them open to reveal...

     A man standing right outside.

                              JOHNS
                         (through window)
               Hey. Don't go too far, huh?

     Fry nods. Johns smiles, leaves. Just as her heart settles,
     SOMETHING CREAKS behind her.

     It's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the
     planets around their suns. Solar powered, the orrery starts
     turning, CREAKING. One planet seems always to have sunlight.

                              FRY
               No darkness. No lights because no
               darkness....


     EXT. PORCH - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Fry reaches a porch. It looks out over the rear of the
     settlement and more unforgiving terrain. She starts back
     inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision. Fry
     turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the
     source of the glint.

     Excited hits on her breather.

     Fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic
     bearing. Soon she's running.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

                              FRY (V.O.)
               Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!

     Johns and the Chrislams trade looks.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

                              FRY
               Allahu Akbar!

     Fry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath. The others catch
     up. They too marvel at...

     The skiff, a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part bush
     plane, part space craft. Its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but
     the hull looks intact.


     EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY

     CLOSE on caviar being added to toast-points.

     A SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris in mid-bite. He eases out of his
     rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on...

     A shadow ducking under him. Small rocks still trickle down a
     dirt rampart just climbed by...someone.

                              PARIS
               This now qualifies as the worst fun I've
               ever had. Stop it.

     No response.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     War-pick in hand, Paris eases to ground-level. He checks the
     perimeter, looks inside the ship. Nobody. Is he being fucked
     with? Again? He hopes?

                              PARIS
               Audrey? Oh, Audrey....

                              AUDREY (O.S.)
               What?

     Paris spins. The voice came from the cargo hold -- and not where
     he expected.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     Blades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull. Paris
     enters to find Shazza and Audrey cutting open containers,
     searching for usable goods.

                              PARIS
               Tell me that was you.

                              AUDREY
               Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?

                              PARIS
               Assailing my fragile sense of security,
               that's what.

                              SHAZZA
               What're you goin' on about? She's been
               right here for the last....

     They all see it: Sun-blades are momentarily blocked by something
     passing outside. Someone.

                              SHAZZA
                         (a quiet probe)
               Zeke?

     No answer. Audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye
     to a crack there.

     HULL-CRACK POV: Far away, Zeke finishes digging the grave. He
     starts toward the ship.

     Audrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: "RIDDICK!"

     Paris goes bloodless. Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his
     frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there,
     ready to strike. Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang.
     All eyes watch as...

     The sun-blades, winking off and on, chart Riddick's approach:
     We feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the
     blades shave closer and closer to us. Suddenly he appears...

     And Shazza swings hard.

                              AUDREY
               No!

     Facing them is a TOTAL STRANGER -- burned, half naked, one hand
     still clutching the emergency-release lever of his cryo-locker.
     Shazza stopped one inch short of killing him.

                              TOTAL STRANGER
               I thought...my God, I thought I was the
               only one who....

     He lurches toward Shazza, trying to embrace her -- and sees blood
     and brain-bits BLAM-BLAMMING against her. His own. The stranger
     sinks bonelessly to the ground. FAST RACK to reveal Zeke in the
     background, pistol leveled. He reads Shazza's horrified face --
     and understands what he's done.

                              PARIS
               Oh, Lord....

                              AUDREY
               It was just somebody else. From the
               crash. He was just....

                              ZEKE
               Cripes galore, I thought it was him. The
               murderin' ratbag. I thought he was....

     He rushes over to check the dead stranger. As he bends down,
     FAST RACK AGAIN to reveal Riddick in the background. He stands
     20 paces off, still unseen by the others. His goggle eyes
     covet...

     Zeke's breather.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

     Fry exits the skiff.

                              FRY
               No juice, looks like it's been laid up
               for years. But we might be able to
               adapt --

                              JOHNS
               Shut up.

     Outside, Johns has an ear cocked to the wind.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Sorry. Thought I heard something.

                              FRY
               Like what?

                              JOHNS
               Like my pistola.


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     START on the drag-sled carrying Corpse #4-- the stranger.

     Zeke reaches the grave. The sun-tarp has fallen on one side,
     blocking the sight-line between ship and grave. Zeke starts to
     unload the body -- but sees something he didn't notice before:
     There's some kind of opening at the bottom of the grave.

                              ZEKE
               Now what the bloody hell....

     Zeke hops down into the grave. CAMERA MOVES to reveal Riddick
     hidden among the spires. He's been waiting for a chance just
     like this.


     EXT. GRAVE - DAY

     Zeke drops to all fours. Looks into the tunnel. There seems to
     be some kind of burrow beyond.

     BURROW POV: Staring back at Zeke.

     Zeke takes a handlight off his belt, shines it into the burrow.
     It's the last thing he ever does.


     INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     As MORE GUNSHOTS jar Paris, Audrey, Shazza.


     EXT. GRAVE - DAY

     FURIOUS CLOSEUPS: Zeke fighting for his life. PISTOL BLASTING.
     Something slashing at him. Blood dancing on air.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Shazza sprints across hard-pack, heading for...


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     The grave. She slaps aside the tarp to find...

     Riddick. Bone-shiv in hand, he just stands on the other side of
     the grave. Shazza looks down. And SCREAMS.


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     CAMERA PURSUES Riddick as he lopes through the spires, running
     from the scene of the crime. He turns a blind corner -- and
     SOMETHING NEARLY BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF at close range. He hits
     ground. A boot steps on his neck, keeping him there.

                              JOHNS
               Same crap, different planet, huh?


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Sucking on their breathers, Fry and the Chrislams make it back to
     the ship. They find Johns beating Riddick like a chained dog.

                              JOHNS
               ...I don't play that...I don't play that
               so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell
               me a better lie....

                              FRY
               Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me
               what....

     She hauls him off -- only to have Shazza start punching Riddick.

                              SHAZZA
               What'd you do with 'im? You bloody sick
               animal you, what'dja do with me Zeke?


     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     Fry and Johns stand over the grave. It's a gory mess -- but no
     sign of Zeke. Johns has Riddick's confiscated shiv.

                              FRY
               He used that?

                              JOHNS
               Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.

                              FRY
               So why isn't it all bloody?

                              JOHNS
               I assume he licked it clean.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening
     to SOTTO VOCE VOICES outside. Fry enters, looks at him hard.

                              FRY
               So where is he?

     Riddick turns away, revealing a broken goggle-lens. The eye
     beneath is closed: For some reason, he won't look at her.

                              FRY
               Tell me about the sounds. You told them
               you heard something right before....
                         (no response)
               If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take
               another crack at it -- at your skull.

                              RIDDICK
               'Mean the whispers?

                              FRY
               What whispers?

                              RIDDICK
               The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet
               spot -- just to the left of the spine,
               fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta.
               What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt,
               so I used it to catch a little run-off.
               Metallic taste to it, human blood.
               Coppery. But if you cut it with
               peppermint schnapps, that goes away.
               Course, that's more for winter.
               Summertime, I take mine straight.

     Fry stares. Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as
     Boogeyman: If fear is the only kind of respect he can get,
     Riddick is going to grab some with both hands.

                              FRY
               Why don't we try the truth now?

     A head-shaking beat, then:

                              RIDDICK
               All you people are so scared of me --
               an' most days, I'd take that as a
               compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta
               worry about now.

                              FRY
               Show me your eyes.

     Again he turns away. She strips the goggles off. He sits with
     lids shut tight, anticipating the pain.

                              FRY
               Show me, Riddick.

     Imagine a virgin undressing in front of someone for the first
     time. That's how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No
     irises, just huge black-pool pupils. And from deep within, a
     jewel-like eyeshine. His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as
     those of a starved jaguar.

                              FRY
               You did this? To yourself?

                              RIDDICK
               Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."

                              FRY
               Heard about it. Just never seen it.

                              RIDDICK
               Fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say?
               Slamlight's so dim that you go and get
               your eyeballs taken out and shined up --
               then you wind up here. Three ass-kick
               suns.
                         (replacing goggles)
               Maybe I did do a few people. But not this
               one. No ma'am, not this time.

                              FRY
               Then where is he? He's not in the hole.
               We looked.

                              RIDDICK
               Look deeper.

     He CLICKS HIS TONGUE at her.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Chain looped over one shoulder, Fry heads back to the grave site.
     Johns, Imam, Shazza, and Audrey keep pace as...

                              JOHNS
               I know what happened -- he went off on the
               guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and
               now he's trying to --

                              FRY
               Let's just be sure.

                              JOHNS
               I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick
               belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He
               loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you
               afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And
               you're playing right into --

                              FRY
               We're gonna find the body, Johns. Christ,
               you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this?
               We gotta go down and find it.

                              JOHNS
               Well, don't ask me to.

                              FRY
               Thought you didn't believe his story.

                              JOHNS
               I don't. But that ground looked none too
               stable, and I don't want anyone --

                              AUDREY
               If you're afraid, I'll go.

     He shoots Audrey a scowl.

                              FRY
               Nobody else is going down but me, okay?

                              JOHNS
                         (pulling her aside)
               Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now
               doesn't change what came before -- it's
               just stupid.

                              FRY
               What, you think I'm doin' this to prove
               something?

                              JOHNS
               You said it, not me. Let's just not let
               one bad call lead to another.

                              FRY
               Thanks for the tip, Johns.

     "Now get outta my way."


     EXT. GRAVE - DAY

     Chain hooked to her web belt, Fry drops into the grave. She
     peers into the burrow...looks back up at the halo of faces above
     her...then slithers out of sight.


     INT. BURROW - DAY

     Letting her eyes adjust, Fry pats around lightly. Quickly she
     finds Zeke's handlight, tries it. Broken.


     EXT. GRAVE-SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     CLOSE on the chain slithering through hands, playing out as Fry
     moves deeper underground.


     INT. UPHILL TUNNEL - DAY

     Fry makes an uphill turn. Sees a spray of light ahead. Worms
     forward to reach...


     INT. THE LAIR - DAY

     Another chamber, wide and just large enough to stand in. Shafts
     of daylight bore down into the room. More old bones litter the
     floor. Fry moves into one shaft and looks up at...

     An earthen funnel. The inside of a spire.

                              FRY
               They're hollow....

     CLICK-CLICK.

     Fry slow-turns toward the sound.

     CLICK-CLICK-CLICK.

     There's something here, something just beyond the cusp of light.
     Something unfolding.

     An icy hand grips her heart. Soundlessly, Fry backtracks her
     chain, but...

     Something shadows across the exit. It stops her cold.

     Her hand finds something new. She angles it to the light. It's
     one of Zeke's boots -- with a bit of Zeke still in it.

     CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY....

     The whole chamber is coming alive around her, shadows unfurling,
     skulking the perimeter, circling.

     Something impales the boot out of her hand, reclaiming it. It
     was faster than a lightning-strike.

     A paralyzed beat before...

     Fry makes her move, rolling back into the shaft of daylight and
     springing straight up into...


     INT. SPIRE - DAY

     The spire. Bracing against the walls, Fry tries to "walk" her
     way up -- but her chain goes taut. Did it catch on something?
     Or did something catch it? Fry starts pounding the earthen walls.

                              FRY
               Here! I'm in HERE, HERE, HERE!


     EXT. GRAVE-SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY

                              IMAM
               Did you hear....

     They drop down and suspend their heads over the bloody grave,
     listening. Nothing now.


     INT. SPIRE - DAY

                              FRY
               I'm over here in the --

     Something tugs on her chain.

                              FRY
               Oh, God....

     CLOSE on her feet. Kicking hard at the walls, trying to gouge
     out footholds.

     A stronger tug. Fry loses altitude, slipping closer to...

     The MADLY CLICKING LAIR below.

     She tries to jettison her belt -- but can't brace herself up and
     undo the belt. Suddenly...

     Something explodes near her head. Daylight appears, followed by
     faces, human faces. They're breaking through the spire with the
     pick-ax. Hands reach inside...


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DAY

     ...and birth her into daylight. Overlapping:

                              JOHNS
               We got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got
               you now....

                              IMAM
               The child heard you before any of us could
               even....

                              SHAZZA
               Did you find him? You find Zeke?

                              FRY
                         (half insane)
               ...wasn't Riddick...it was...it was...
               goddamn, that was stupid....but wasn't
               Riddick. Somethin' else down there that
               got Zeke and nearly got --

     Her. She flies back into the spire. Something's still got the
     chain.

     The others grab at flailing limbs. It's a tug-of-war now, human
     hands on one end, unseen "hands" on the other -- and the humans
     are losing. Until...

     Imam unsheathes his blade...

     And slices through Fry's belt.


     INT. SPIRE - DAY

     As the chain falls down the spire. Without Fry.


     INT./EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     FAST SHOTS: Survivors packing up O2, liquor, umbrellas, the
     Koran -- whatever qualifies as "essential" on this planet. Amid
     the activity, Audrey pauses to look at...

     The spired hills.


     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Fry and Imam pull a power cell from the ship's battery bay,
     THUMPING it down on the deck.

                              IMAM
               One is all?

                              FRY
               For now.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY

     At his personal locker, Johns digs out a box of shotgun shells.
     He bypasses the blue-metal shells for a red-metal one. There's
     something special about it -- though what, we can't be sure.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     A shadow falls over Riddick. He doesn't look up.

                              RIDDICK
               Found somethin' worse than me, huh?

                              JOHNS
               We're movin'. And I'm just wondering if
               I shouldn't lighten the load right now.

     Now their eyes meet. Johns RATCHETS HIS SHOTGUN and points it
     at Riddick's head.

                              RIDDICK
               Woof, woof.

     The SHOTGUN EXPLODES. CAMERA PANS off of Johns to show
     Riddick still alive. The shotgun discharged next to his head and
     blew off his wrist chains.

                              JOHNS
               Want you to remember this moment, Riddick.
               The way it coulda gone and didn't.

                              RIDDICK
                         (deaf)
               Say that again.

                              JOHNS
               Here's the deal. You work without the
               chains, without the bit -- without the
               shivs. You help us get off this rock....

                              RIDDICK
               For what? The honor of goin' back to some
               asshole of a cell?

                              JOHNS
               Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this
               head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as
               much as you wanna be free of me.

     A beat. The future rearranges in Riddick's head.

                              RIDDICK
               You'd cut me loose, Boss?

                              JOHNS
               Only if we both get outta this alive.
               And there may be a way.

     He offers a hand to help Riddick up, to seal the deal.

                              RIDDICK
                         (staring at hand)
               My recommendation: Do me. Don't take
               the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on
               your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick.
               Would if I were you.

                              JOHNS
               If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon,
               you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?

     A beat. Riddick reaches out for the hand -- and grabs the
     shotgun with his off-hand. A blur of movement. Suddenly Johns
     is staring at the eyes of his own shotgun.

                              RIDDICK
               Want you to remember this moment.

     He pumps shotgun, spitting blue shells over Johns. He drops the
     emptied gun and walks away.


     EXT. PLANET - DAY

     EXTREMELY WIDE: Blue sun setting, yellow and red sun rising.
     The survivors trek for the settlement. Fry and Imam lug the
     power cell between them, but the real load is shouldered by...

     Riddick. Promoted from murderous monster to beast of burden,
     he tows a drag-sled heavy with cargo.

                              PARIS
                         (to Johns)
               So just like that. Wave your little wand
               and he's one of us now.

                              JOHNS
               Didn't say that. But least this way I
               don't have to worry about falling asleep
               and not wakin' up.

                              IMAM
               Well, I feel we owe Mr. Riddick amends.

                              SHAZZA
               Oh, right. Let's all line up and beg his
               forgiveness. Right you are.

                              IMAM
               At least give the man some oxygen....

                              JOHNS
               He's happy just bein' vertical. Leave him
               be.

                              AUDREY
               So I can talk to him now?

                              JOHNS/SHAZZA
                         (in unison)
               No.

     Paris drops a wine bottle. Trailing, Riddick collects it.

                              PARIS
               Paris P. Ogilvie. Antiquities dealer,
               entrepreneur.

                              RIDDICK
                         (shaking hands)
               Richard B. Riddick. Escaped convict,
               murderer.

     Instead of returning the bottle, Riddick opens it and drinks.
     Paris hurries to catch up to the others.

                              PARIS
               You know, if I owned Hell and this
               planet...I believe I'd rent this out and
               live in Hell.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - DAY

     FRY'S POV: Of spires high above us.

     The group falls silent as they transit the canyon, all eyes on
     the spires. Fry stops short, hearing...

     CLICKITY-CLICK.

     Neck hairs rise -- but soon the sound vanishes. The group starts
     moving again, faster.

     CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICK.

     Are they being stalked? Nervously, Fry traces the sound back
     to...

     Beads dangling from the belt of Pilgrim #1. Whenever he moves,
     the STRINGS CLACK together.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

                              PARIS
               I mean, usually I can appreciate antiques,
               but, uh....

     The survivors have reached the settlement. Fry is trying to get
     the power cell aboard the skiff as the others walk its exterior.

                              JOHNS
               Little ratty-ass.

                              FRY
               Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the
               electrical adapts.

                              SHAZZA
               Not a star-jumper.

                              RIDDICK
               Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back
               up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick
               out a thumb. You'll get picked up.
                         (to Fry)
               Right?

     Fry looks from Riddick to Johns. "How did he know that?"

                              FRY
               Little help here?

     They muscle the power cell aboard. Riddick starts to follow, but
     Johns blocks. He doesn't want Riddick inside.

                              JOHNS
               Check those containers for me. See what
               we can patch wings with.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     With religious fervor, the Chrislams are repairing the moisture-
     recovery unit -- the machine Allah led them to.


     INT. SKIFF - DAY

     START on the battery bay. Hands are adapting the power cell to
     the skiffs older electrical system. Soon...

     Lights wink on throughout the ship.

                              FRY
               Okay, that should buy us a sys-check.
               But we'll need more cells.

                              JOHNS
               How many?

                              FRY
               15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other
               ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five.
               Five total to launch.

                              JOHNS
               25 kilos each, huh?

                              SHAZZA
               Old sand-cat outside. See if I can't get
               it up and chuggin'.

                              JOHNS
               Do it. And if you need an extra hand,
               tap our problem child out....
                         (looking out)
               Where's Riddick?


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     He's walking the ghost town, finding dead gardens...upended
     chairs and furniture...broken skylights. Behind his back...

     Audrey and Pilgrim #3 (the youngest Chrislam) scurry through
     FRAME, stalking this curious monster in their midst.


     EXT. MOISTURE-RECOVERY UNIT - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     CLOSE on the other Chrislams, faces charged with anticipation
     while awaiting...

     The first drop of water. It appears at the bottom of a pipette.

     Tongues fight for it. Another drop forms in its place. Now
     another and another. It brings CHEERS.


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     CLOSE on Paris' hands. Getting ready to celebrate, he unwraps
     crystal goblets...dusts off the refectory table...and rehangs an
     old Christmas garland. INTERCUT WITH...


     EXT. CORING ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Hands digging in dirt.

     Covertly, Audrey and Pilgrim #3 watch Riddick digging near the
     entrance of a tall windowless structure.

     He excavates a pair of broken eyeglasses... a shattered light...
     and a child's tin robot, timeless. Riddick thumbs a solar panel
     clean. The robot's language program warbles to life:

                              ROBOT
               "...to all intruders. I am the guardian
               of this land. I will protect my masters
               at all cost. Death to all intruders..."

     Riddick stands and tries the doors. Locked. He peers through a
     small filthy window. Is there something moving inside? Nothing
     now. Riddick removes some windblown trash from a doorside sign.
     "Coring Room."

                              JOHNS (O.S.)
               Missin' the party. C'mon.

     It's Johns, keeping him on a short leash. Leaving, Riddick kicks
     a trash bin. Hard.

                              RIDDICK
               Missin' the party. C'mon.

     He leaves. HOLD on the trash bin a beat.


                              AUDREY (O.S.)
               Talkin' to me?


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     PILGRIM'S POV: Of Audrey exiting the trash bin and running after
     Riddick and Johns.

     Pilgrim #3 is at the window of the coring room. He's found a way
     inside. By the window's feeble light, he starts exploring. Just
     visible at the center of this room is a vertical coring drill.


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

                              IMAM
               ...and for this, our gift of drink, we
               give thanks in the name of our Prophet,
               Muhammad, peace be upon him, and to our
               Lord, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and to his
               father, Allah the Compassionate and the
               Merciful.

                              PARIS
                         (to himself)
               The strangest religion....

     Pilgrims finish pouring cloudy water into goblets. Riddick gets
     the last of it -- the part with sediment. SELECTED CLOSEUPS as
     they drink. Nothing ever tasted finer.

                              PARIS
               Perhaps we should toast our hosts. Who
               were these people, anyway? Miners?

                              SHAZZA
               Looks like geologists. Advance team,
               moves around from rock to rock.

                              JOHNS
               Musta crapped out here, huh?

                              AUDREY
               But why did they leave their ship?

     Silence. It's a question no one has chosen to deal with yet.
     Imam notices one water glass unspoken for.


     EXT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on the "Coring Room" sign. An attached solar panel begins
     moving, orienting toward sunlight. When it catches the full
     brunt of the suns' rays...

     STORM SHUTTERS unlatch on the roof.


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     Pilgrim #3 hears SHOOTING LATCHES overhead. That sound brings
     another sound: A strange SKITTERING. The pilgrim looks up. Is
     there something in the rafters?


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

                              JOHNS
                         (answering Audrey)
               Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.

                              PARIS
               Like an emergency life-raft, right?

                              SHAZZA
               Sure. Coulda had a real drop-ship take
               them off-planet. Long gone.

                              PARIS
               A toast to their ghosts, then....

     Goblets rise.

                              RIDDICK
               Didn't leave, these people. Whatever got
               Zeke got them. They're all dead.

     It's like he just pissed in the punchbowl.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               What, you don't really think they left
               with their clothes on the lines? Photos
               on the walls?

                              SHAZZA
               Maybe they had weight limits, you don't
               know.

                              RIDDICK
               I know you don't uncrate your emergency
               ship unless there's a fucking emergency.

                              JOHNS
               Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your
               theories on --

                              FRY
                         (to Riddick)
               So what happened? Where are they, then?

     Fry is the only one willing to look at reality -- or at least
     glance its way. At the window, Imam scans outside.

                              IMAM
               Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?

                              RIDDICK
                         (to Fry and Imam)
               Has anyone checked the coring room?


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     Now the storm shutters start yawning open, spreading daylight
     over Pilgrim #3 and...

     The ceiling rafters. They're encrusted with thick nests of...
     something. The SKITTERING grows louder, more agitated.

     Sensing trouble, Pilgrim #3 hurries for a sliver of daylight in
     a wall -- the breach he entered through. He never gets there:

     Sunlight hits the first nest. It EXPLODES WITH LIFE.


     INT./EXT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As Imam hears the SCREAM.

                              IMAM
               Ali....


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     CHAOTIC SHOTS: More NESTS EXPLODE into individual creatures,
     winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking and
     slashing. His exit blocked, Pilgrim #3 veers into...

     A dark supply room. He slams the door, MUMBLES A BLESSING and
     waits for the storm to pass. He's been cut -- but at least he's
     still alive.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As the survivors run for the coring room.


     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As Riddick stays behind to drink their water.


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

     HINGES ARE BLASTED AWAY. The door caves in. Imam shoulders
     past Johns to enter and find...

     The empty coring room.

                              IMAM
               Ali?

     A NOISE from the supply room. Is it Ali? Just too scared to
     come out? Imam opens the door...

     And hatchlings pour out.

     Moving with a gang-intelligence, they circle the room in a wave,
     soar high into the rafters -- then plunge into the coring shaft,
     SQUEALS VANISHING to infinity. Shocked silence, then...

     Pilgrim #3 tumbles to the ground. He's been shredded into bloody
     kite-tails. There was a nest inside the supply room.

     Imam falls on him in grief. Johns and Fry inch forward to peer
     down...

     The coring shaft. It's littered with human bones. The skeletons
     of the settlers. Scattered about and picked clean.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Against a blue sunrise, the Chrislams hold a prayer service.
     Paris and Audrey attend. Riddick watches from afar.


     INT. CORING ROOM - DAY

                              SHAZZA
               Why was the door chained up? Why the
               bloody hell would they lock themselves in
               like that?

                              JOHNS
               Not sure, but tell you what: Chrislams
               better not be diggin' another grave out
               there.

                              RIDDICK (O.S.)
               Other buildings weren't secure...

     They turn. Riddick enters.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               ...so they ran here. Heaviest doors.
               Thought they'd be safe inside, but...
                         (looks down shaft)
               Someone forget to lock the back door.

     Shazza joins him at the shaft. Gazing on the human remains:

                              SHAZZA
               So that's what come of me Zeke. An' you
               saw it. You was right there.

     Riddick nods.

                              SHAZZA (CONT'D)
               You were tryin' to kill him too.

                              RIDDICK
                         (shrugging, "not
                          necessarily")
               Just wanted his O-2.
                         (a beat)
               Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass.
               When he shot up that stranger instead.

     Shazza can't deny it. She looks at him differently now, the man
     she once beat while in chains. She takes off her breather.

                              SHAZZA
               Take it.

                              RIDDICK
                         (suspicious)
               What, it's broken?

                              SHAZZA
               Startin' to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.

     Riddick accepts it awkwardly, sucks down some pure O2. Johns
     watches the exchange closely, not much liking the idea of Riddick
     being promoted to oxygen-breathing human.

                              JOHNS
                         (to Fry)
               Let's board this up and get the hell gone.
               They seem to stick to the dark, so if we
               stick to daylight, should be all --

                              FRY
               60 years ago.

                              JOHNS
               Wha'?

     Coring samples line the room, laid out on counters. Fry's been
     scrutinizing them.

                              FRY
               Core-samples are dated. Last one is 60
               years ago. This month.

                              SHAZZA
               Yeah? What's special about that?

                              FRY
               Dunno. Maybe nothing, but....

     But now Fry remembers...


     INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     The orrery. The year-counter clicks over to "45" as...

     Fry opens the drive box and starts turning the main gear,
     accelerating the orbits.

     CLOSE on the counter. "56...57...58...59...60."

     They all see it: A giant ringed world eclipses the suns and
     plunges their planet into darkness. Persistent darkness.

                              JOHNS
               Are you fuckin' kidding me?

                              RIDDICK
               Not afraid of the dark, are you?


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Crossing the yard in wide strides:

                              FRY
               ...need those cells from the crash ship.
               Shit, still gotta check out the hull,
               patch the wings --

                              JOHNS
               Let's wait on the power cells.

                              FRY
               Wait for what? Until it's so dark we
               can't even find our way back to --

                              JOHNS
               We're not sure when it happens, so let's
               not --

                              FRY
               Get the fucking cells over here, Johns.
               What's the discussion?

     A beat.

                              JOHNS
               Ever tell you how Riddick escaped?


     INT. SKIFF - DAY

     Alone inside the skiff, Johns and Fry continue with more privacy.

                              FRY
                         (jarred)
               He can pilot?

                              JOHNS
               Hijacked a prison transport, made a
               helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.

                              FRY
                         (with faint hope)
               Okay, maybe that's a good thing. Maybe I
               can use him to help with --

                              JOHNS
               He also figured out how to kill the pilot,
               Fry.

     A mental shiver.

                              FRY
               You said we were going to trust him now.
               You said there was a deal.

                              JOHNS
               That's what I said.

     He challenges her to read his mind.

                              FRY
               Oh, this is a dangerous game you're
               playing, Johns.

                              JOHNS
               May've noticed chains don't work on this
               guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he
               believes he's goin' free. But if he stops
               believin' --

                              FRY
               You mean, if he learns that you're gonna
               royally fuck him over.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               -- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells
               over at the last possible minute -- when
               the wings are ready, when we know we're
               ready to launch.

     Fry looks at him with new eyes.

                              FRY
               You know, he hasn't harmed any of us.
               Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied
               to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns.
               Let him go if that's what it --

                              JOHNS
               He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta
               do his bid.

     Shaking her head, she looks off.

                              FRY
               Dancin' on razor blades here...

                              JOHNS
               I won't give him a chance to grab another
               ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.


     EXT. SKIFF - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Johns descends the gangway -- and finds Riddick erecting a field
     table in the shade of the skiff. He seems out of earshot. Now,
     anyway. As they trade looks, another flu-like shiver runs
     through Johns.

                              RIDDICK
               Bad sign. Shakin' like that in this heat.

     Johns moves on. The Chrislams appear, shouldering a roll of
     Vectran (wing-fabric material). They drop it on the table.
     Ready to cut bindings, Imam pats his hip for the knife that was
     just there.

                              RIDDICK
                         (looking after Johns)
               I'll cut.

     He has the knife.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     As Shazza and Audrey repair the sand-cat.


     EXT. SKIFF - DAY

     CLOSE on the knife slicing through the Vectran.

     Riddick hands the trim to Pilgrim #1. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he
     scampers onto the skiff...balance-beams over wing-struts...and
     delivers the piece to Imam, who stitches the fabric like an old
     Berber rug-weaver. Pilgrim #1 pauses to check on...

     The setting blue sun. Nothing unusual. Yet.


     INT. SKIFF - DAY

     The hatch closes, seals.

     CLOSE on a monitor. A "HULL INTEGRITY TEST" is underway. Fry
     scans rising pressure gauges.

                              RIDDICK (O.S.)
               Looks like we're a few shy....

     Fry whirls. Riddick is aboard, staring at the depleted battery
     bay. And he has Imam's blade.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               Power cells.

                              FRY
               They're coming.

                              RIDDICK
               Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main
               drive yet.
                         (half-beat)
               Strange unless he told you the particulars
               of my escape.

                              FRY
               I got the quick-and-ugly version.

                              RIDDICK
               An' now you're worried about a repeat of
               history?

                              FRY
               Entered our minds.

                              RIDDICK
               I asked what you thought.

                              FRY
               You scare me, Riddick. That's what you
               wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it,
               Can I get back to work now?

     She finds the courage to turn her back on him. Riddick moves
     closer -- and takes a beat to scan the controls. The cabin
     pressure builds.

                              RIDDICK
               Think Johns is an do-right man? You
               think I can trust him to cut me loose?

     A beat. Does Riddick already know? Is he testing her?

                              FRY
               Why, what'd you hear?

                              RIDDICK
               Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd
               just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth
               twice as much alive.
                         (reading her face)
               Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's
               got that shiny badge an' all, but nah --
               he's just a merc and I'm just a payday.
               That's why he won't kill me. The creed is
               greed.

     It knocks her off stride, but...

                              FRY
               Save it, Riddick. We aren't gonna turn on
               each other -- no matter how hard you try.

     Riddick moves right up behind her.

                              RIDDICK
               I don't truly know what's gonna happen
               when the lights go out, Carolyn -- but I
               do know that once the dyin' starts, this
               little psycho family of ours is gonna rip
               itself apart. So you better find out the
               truth. Come nightfall, you better know
               exactly who's standing behind you.

     A monitor chirps the news: "HULL INTEGRITY --100%." EXHALING
     GASSES, the hatch opens automatically.

                              RIDDICK
               Oh, ask him 'bout those shakes. And ask
               why your crew-pal had to scream like that
               'fore he died.


     INT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     CLOSEUPS: Hands select a red-metal shotgun shell from a box...
     pull the shell open...remove a glass ampule hidden inside...drop
     the ampule into a injection syringe. The syringe touches an
     eager arm vein.

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Who are you? Really?

     Shirt off, Johns looks up. She's in the doorway.

                              FRY (CONT'D)
               You're not a real cop, are you? Just some
               mercenary who goes around talkin' about
               the law like --

                              JOHNS
               I never said I was.

                              FRY
               Never said you were a hype, either.

     She moves closer. Rummages through his stuff brazenly. Finds a
     shitload of red shells with the hidden ampules.

                              JOHNS
               You have a little caffeine in the morning,
               I have a little morphine. So what?

                              FRY
               And here you got two mornings every day.
               Wow, were you born lucky?

                              JOHNS
               Not a problem unless you're gonna make --

                              FRY
                         (lashing)
               You made it a problem when you let Owens
               die like that. When you had enough drugs
               to knock out a fucking mule-team.

                              JOHNS
               Owens was already dead. His brain just
               hadn't caught on to that fact.

                              FRY
               Anything else we should know about you,
               Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play
               games with our lives when --

     He catches her hands -- and moves them around his body, forcing
     her into an embrace. We understand why when we see a CLOSEUP
     of her hands: They find a jagged purple scar beside his spine.

                              JOHNS
               My first run-in with Riddick. Went for
               the sweet-spot and missed. They had to
               leave a piece of the shiv in there. I can
               feel it, sometimes, pressing against the
               cord.
                         (giving her hands back)
               So maybe the care and feeding of my
               nerve-endings is my business.

                              FRY
               You coulda helped. And you didn't.

     O.S., we hear the Chrislams JABBERING ARABIC and calling for
     "Captain, Captain...."

                              JOHNS
               Yeah, well, look to thine own ass first.
               Right, "captain"?

     It cuts deep.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Fry and Johns move outside. The others have gathered, all eyes
     gang-locked on...

     An arch in the sky. Luminous, ominous, it grows from the horizon.

                              PARIS
               What do my eyes see?

                              FRY
               It's starting....

     They watch hypnotically as the arch rises, inching toward the two
     suns. Shazza shakes out of the trance first.

                              SHAZZA
                         (to Fry)
               If we need anything from the crash ship --
               I suggest we kick on. That sand-cat's
               solar.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY

     MULTIPLE SHOTS: Shazza cranking the sand-cat...hands snatching
     up lights, water, ropes...Chrislams piling aboard the sand-cat.

                              FRY
               LET'S GET THOSE CELLS!

     Sand-cat moving...Riddick jumping onto the rear bed....Paris and
     Audrey running, catching up.

                              SHAZZA
               We stay together! C'mon!


     INT. PRIVATE ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     Johns doubles back, grabs his shotgun shells, swings out the
     door...


     EXT. INCINERATOR - SETTLEMENT - DAY

     ...and catches up to the sand-cat. Riddick reels him aboard.

                              RIDDICK
               Don't wanna miss this.

                              AUDREY
               Lookit. Lookit!

     They turn back to see the rim of a giant planet. It's cresting
     over the horizon. The luminous arch is the planet's rings.


     EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY

     The sand-cat storms through the canyon. As it passes through the
     massive ribcage...

     The ROLL CAGE SMASHES OUT some low-bridge bones.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     The sand-cat reaches the crash ship. Bodies leap off. Paris
     steals a look at...

     The rising planet. It threatens to blot out suns, sky, universe.


     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Johns yanks the first power cell and starts dragging it over the
     deck. Riddick yanks a second cell and, carrying it on his
     shoulder, passes Johns with a suck-my-ass grin. Johns shoulders
     his cell and stumbles after.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY

     Shazza wheels the sand-cat around, getting clearance between it
     and the ship.

     The Chrislams lash a scrap-metal sled to the sand-cat.

     Riddick drops the first cell onto the sled, Johns the second.
     They're racing the eclipse and each other.


     EXT. SKY - DAY TO DUSK

     As the rings of the planet eclipse the yellow sun.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DUSK

     It's like God just closed a blind: Daylight dims. The change in
     light brings a GROWING HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.

                              FRY
               Don't stop, don't stop....

     But Paris can't help himself. He squints to see...


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DUSK

     The spires. THE SOUND seems to come from there.


     EXT. SKY - DUSK

     As the rings eclipse the red sun.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

     A second darkness sweeps over the survivors. Now they all stop,
     beholding...


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK

     Something pouring from the spire-tops. Backlit by coronal light,
     it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these
     are living things, HATCHLINGS SQUEALING IN DELIGHT over their
     first nightfall.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

                              JOHNS
               Jesus, how many can there....

     They keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. Mercifully,
     the hatchlings seem to be moving away. But now one wave cleaves
     from another -- and does a quick about-face.

                              PARIS
               Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should
               flee.

                              FRY
               Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold.
               lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.

     They run. Reach the cargo hold. Turn back to see...

     Riddick and Shazza still coming. Hearing the SQUEALING WAVE
     descending on them...

     Riddick and Shazza hit to the dirt. Hatchlings torrent just
     inches overhead.

     CLOSE on Shazza. Horrified. Hard to breathe. Like being
     underwater.

     CLOSE on Riddick. He watches in awe, no more frightened that a
     kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. Experimenting, he
     eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings. Instantly it's whittled
     down to nothing. It's like a river of razor blades.

     The hatchling keep coming. Shazza whips a panicky look at the
     cargo hold. Can she make it? Should she even try?

                              AUDREY
               Tell her to stay there. Stay down.
               SHAZZA, JUST STAY DOWN!

     Shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. Suddenly the
     hatchings vanish. A beat. Is it safe? Shazza gets to her
     feet...

                              FRY
               No, no, NO, NO, NO....

     ...and the wave is back, enveloping Shazza.


     INT./EXT. CARGO HOLD - DEEP DUSK

     Standing in the mouth of the cargo container, the others get a
     last glimpse of Shazza as she flies by the doors, caught up in
     the funnel-cloud of hatchlings. Then she's simply gone.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

     Still on the ground, Riddick checks left and right like someone
     about to cross a busy street. Now he gets up, smacks his hands
     clean, strolls for the hold. Behind him...

     A rising GANG-CLICKING.

     CLOSE on Fry. She knows the sound better than anyone.


     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK

     The spires are crumbling, torn down from within.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK

     Reaching the cargo hold, Riddick turns around for one last look.
     PUSH IN as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his
     jaguar eyes.

     RIDDICK'S POV: In degraded image, we see the predators -- adult
     hatchlings -- emerge from the spires. They're large, mammalian,
     hammer-headed. They CLICK with echo-location, sounding out the
     world they haven't inhabited in 60 years.

                              FRY
               What is it? What's happening?

     RIDDICK'S POV: The predators launch from the hills, gliding,
     SOUNDING, searching.

                              RIDDICK
               Like I said. Ain't me you gotta worry
               about.


     EXT. SKY - DEEP DUSK TO NIGHT

     The rim of the planet overtakes both suns. The world goes dark.


     INT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Vault-like DOORS BOOM CLOSED.

     The survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship.
     Somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their
     cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths.

                              AUDREY
               What if...what if she's still out there...
               still alive....

                              JOHNS
               Well, I don't want to jump to conclusions
               here...but 'member that boneyard? These
               just might be the fuckers that killed
               every other living thing on this planet,
               okay? Chances of Shazza knockin' on that
               door anytime soon are just about zero
               squared.

                              FRY
                         (agreeing)
               I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't
               a natural die-off.

                              IMAM
               Quiet, please. Everyone.

     Imam is listening at the cargo door. The others pile up
     alongside, ears tuned like radar. CLICKING SWEEPS PAST outside.

                              AUDREY
                         (whispering)
               Why do they do that? Make that sound?

                              IMAM
               Perhaps the way they see. With sound,
               reflecting back.

                              FRY
                         (realizing)
               Echo-location. That's what it is....

     Now MORE CLICKING -- behind them. Lights whip around to find...

     Nothing. Only the door of an open container about halfway down
     the tunnel-like hold.

     A volley of looks. "How the fuck could one get in here?"

                              FRY
               Breach in the hull. I dunno.

     More CLICKING. Johns realizes they expect him to check it out.

                              JOHNS
               I'd rather piss glass.

                              RIDDICK
               Well, you got the big gauge.

                              JOHNS
               Wanna rag your fat mouth?

                              AUDREY
               Maybe it's just their beads again. Imam,
               are you still --

                              IMAM
               No, no, no, I do not believe --

                              JOHNS
               C'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody
               bugfuck with those things. Why don't you
               just lose the goddamn....

     More CLICKING -- along with the sound of TOPPLING CARGO.

                              RIDDICK
               Big beads.

     Butching up, Johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward...

     The open container. Leading with his shotgun, he FIRES blindly
     around the door. Something SQUEALS -- then silence. Johns eases
     his head and a light around the door to spot...

     Hatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food.

                              JOHNS
                         (to others)
               Okay. We're okay. Just some small ones
               that musta --

     Something WHOOSHES for his head, swinging like a scythe. It
     catches his shotgun, DISCHARGING IT, giving us...

     A flash-image of an adult predator. Up close.

     In one thin second, Johns is back with the others.

                              JOHNS
               Very big beads.

                              PARIS
               Not staying in here another....

     He goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night.
     Fry lunges for him.

                              FRY
               Christ, you don't know what's out there!

                              PARIS
               I know what's in here!

                              IMAM
               Everybody come, this way and we should be
               safe. Hurry, please....


     INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Imam shepherds them into a container. The door slams closed.
     At first, only the sound of MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS. Then a
     SCRATCHING.

     Johns fumbles with a cutting torch. Gets it burning. Adjusts
     the gasses to illuminate...

     The door. Scythe-like blades are probing joints. Suddenly HEAVY
     BLOWS drive everyone back.

                              RIDDICK
                         (to Johns)
               Can you do sumpin' else with that?
               'Sides holding it in my fucking face?

     Taking the hint, Johns starts cutting the common wall between
     containers. It's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the
     blades of the predators.


     INT. SECOND CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     An burn-outline appears in the common wall. Johns kicks out the
     escape hatch. Audrey speed-crawls through first as...


     INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Predators shred into the container right behind them, CLICKING,
     sweeping, hunting.


     INT. THIRD/FOURTH CONTAINERS - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     SERIES OF SHOTS: Again and again, they burn a new escape hatch
     just as the predators break into the container being vacated,
     always entering darkness.


     INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Inside their fifth container now, Johns torches away. Fry and
     Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the
     cargo with their bodies.

     Riddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the
     cargo. Suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind...

                              PARIS
               Hello, hello?

     ...and moves to the front of the container where darkness
     prevails. Something SQUISHES underfoot. He slips off goggles.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of dead hatchlings on the floor. This is the
     open container, the one where Johns found predators.

     Sensing energy, Riddick lifts his face.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of an adolescent predator. It squats atop cargo,
     eating a hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull.

     Sensing Riddick, it sweeps the area with INQUISITIVE CLICKS.

     PREDATOR POV: Of Riddick.

     (NOTE: The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression
     without detail. We're "seeing" what the predator hears with
     echo-location. Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its
     subject in 3-D space.)

     Oblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. Audrey,
     Fry, and Johns worm through. Imam and Pilgrim #2 hang back.
     "Where's Riddick?"

     He's in a stare-down with a predator.

     Searching, Pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head
     caught in a vice-like grip.

                              RIDDICK
               Don't. Move.

     RIDDICK'S POV: As a second predator appears above them. This
     one reaches down with its scythe blade...

     And gently probes the two men. It wants know what they're made
     of.

     CLOSE on the pilgrim's shoes. Over-running with piss.

     More blades descend, moving over them like surgical instruments.
     One test-slices Riddick's shirt.


     INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     In the next container, Fry waits anxiously. Hissing through the
     escape hatch:

                              FRY
               Imam? Where are they?


     INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a predator's scythe blade. It test-slices the pilgrim's
     skin. Blood wells up. All CLICKING CEASES.

                              IMAM (O.S.)
               Hasan?

                              FRY (O.S.)
               Riddick?

     TIGHT on the pilgrim -- more scared now that the clicking has
     stopped. Losing his nerve, he bolts.

                              RIDDICK
               No....

     The predators are on him, just blurs in the dark. DEATH-SCREAM.

     RIDDICK'S POV: A third predator appears above him.

     Making his move, Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the
     escape hatch as...

     Fry's light catches him square in the face. Blinded, Riddick
     HOWLS and stumbles forward. Fry's light leaps deeper to hit...

     The predator right behind him. With a similar reaction, the
     beast HOWLS and flails back.

     HOLD on Fry for a time-stopped moment. What stopped it? Was it
     really her? Suddenly a SHOTGUN EXPLODES beside her head. Jacked
     up, Johns is BLASTING shadows.

                              FRY
               Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!

                              JOHNS
               'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.

     They give him a look. "Sure you did." Suddenly a CARCASS SLAMS
     to the floor, sending everyone jumping back in a perfect splash-
     pattern. "Christ, he did kill one."

     Fry reclaims her dropped light and beams it on the carcass.
     Wherever the light strikes it, the flesh chars and steams.

                              FRY
               There....

                              PARIS
               Like the light is scalding it.

                              FRY
               It hurts them. Light actually hurts
               them....

     VULTURE SOUNDS from the two O.S. adolescents, fighting over the
     scraps of the pilgrim.

                              IMAM
               Is that...Hasan?

     Riddick nods.

                              JOHNS
               We'll burn a candle for him later. C'mon.


     INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

     Cargo has been shoved against the door and walls. The survivors
     gather around Fry's handlight. Audrey -- tough little Audrey --
     has been reduced to a shivering lump of mush.

                              FRY
               ...one cutting torch...one handlight here,
               two more in the cabin...I think two
               more....

                              PARIS
               Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns
               well.

                              FRY
               How many bottles?

                              PARIS
               Not sure. Ten?

                              FRY
               Those umbrellas, the ones that mist.
               Would they burn?
                         (reading his face)
               If you got a receipt?

                              PARIS
               Possibly.

                              FRY
               Awright. So maybe we'll have enough light.

                              JOHNS
               Enough for what?

     Now she challenges him to be the mind-reader.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Oh, lady. If you're in your right mind,
               I pray you go insane.

                              FRY
                         (to others)
               We can stick to the plan. If we get four
               cells back to the skiff, we're off this
               rock.

                              PARIS
               I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an
               ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at
               night.

                              FRY
               We'll have to carry the cells...drag
               them...whatever it takes.

     Troubled faces. Is it just our imagination? Or is the light on
     the floor growing dimmer?

                              AUDREY
               You mean...tonight? With all those things
               still out there?

                              PARIS
               Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.

                              JOHNS
               Back it up. How long can this last? Few
               minutes? Couple hours?

     No one knows for sure.

                              IMAM
               I had the impression...from the model...
               that the two planets were moving as one.
               That there would be...a lasting darkness.

                              JOHNS
               Those suns gotta come back sometime. And
               if these animals really are phobic about
               light, we just sit tight till then.

                              FRY
               I'm sure that's what someone else said.
               Locked inside that coring room.

     A persuasive thought. Eyes swing back to Audrey.

                              JOHNS
               Look, we gotta think about everyone now --
               the kid especially. How scared is she
               gonna be out there?

                              FRY
               Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke
               screen.

                              JOHNS
               Smoke screen for what?

                              FRY
               For your own fear.

                              JOHNS
                         (eyes narrowing)
               Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two
               seconds and let someone else come up with
               a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?

     Two seconds pass.

                              FRY
               How much you weigh, Johns?

                              JOHNS
               What the hell's it matter?

                              FRY
               How much?

                              JOHNS
               79 kilos.

                              FRY
               Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white
               meat, and that's why you can't come up
               with a better plan.

     He makes a move for her. Riddick blocks. Johns' shotgun bumps
     the underside of Riddick's chin.

                              RIDDICK
               Think about that reward, Johns.

                              JOHNS
               I'm willing to take a cut in pay.

                              RIDDICK
               How 'bout a cut in your gut?

     Johns looks down. CAMERA DROPS to reveal the shiv Riddick holds,
     poised for evisceration.

                              JOHNS
               Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.

                              IMAM
               Please...this solves nothing...please....

     Johns backs off first. The light grows dimmer.

                              FRY
                         (to Audrey)
               They're afraid of our light. That means
               we don't have to be so afraid of them.

                              IMAM
               And you're certain you can find the way
               back? Even in the dark?

                              FRY
               No, I'm not. But he can.

     She's pointing, of course, to Riddick.


     EXT. PLANET - NIGHT

     The eclipsing planet dominates half the sky. In whatever coronal
     light remains, we see clouds forming.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     Cargo doors crack open. Mixed for maximum flame, the cutter is
     pushed outside and swept around. Fry appears behind it.

     Moving like hostages, the survivors cross open ground, trying not
     to heed the PRIMAL SOUNDS beyond their light. Soon they reach...

     The main cabin. Blackness inside.

                              FRY
               Riddick.

     He lifts his goggles.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Checking the cabin. Finding a lot of wreckage
     but no life.

                              RIDDICK
               Looks clear.

     Johns shoulders ahead and crawls in first. Just as he stands up
     inside...

     A PREDATOR BUZZSAWS over his head, fleeing the cabin, taking off
     into the night.

                              JOHNS
               Fuck me. You said "clear."

                              RIDDICK
               Said "looks clear."

                              JOHNS
               Well, what's it look like now?

                              RIDDICK
                         (rechecking)
               Looks clear.

                              FRY
               Just get the goddamn lights on....

     They scramble aboard. Riddick TONGUE-CLICKS behind Johns.
     He isn't amused.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     PREP MONTAGE: We see the survivors powering up cabin lights...
     yanking three more cells from the battery bay...threading nylon
     cord through Paris' misting umbrellas, filling the reservoirs
     with high-octane liquor...swapping out O2 canisters.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     Reloading his shotgun, Johns finds himself shaking again. He
     unpockets a shell -- a red morphine shell -- and gives it a
     lover's look. Behind him...

                              FRY
               Ready, Johns.

     He palms the shell.

                              JOHNS
               He'll lead you over the first cliff.
               You know that, don't you?

                              FRY
               We're just burnin' light here.

                              JOHNS
               You give him the cells and the ship --
               and he will leave you. He will leave you
               all out there to die.

                              FRY
               I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn
               valuable in your life that you're worried
               about losing? Huh? Is there anything at
               all? Besides your next hype?
                         (no response)
               Got no right to be so scared. Neither one
               of us.


     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     As hands yank the last power cell.


     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     Cabin lights die. Still brooding, Johns finishes loading his
     shotgun in the dark.


     EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a burning wick. Alcohol mist shoots across the flame to
     create...

     A FIREBALL. Two umbrella torches, fabric already burned away,
     BELCH FIREBALLS into the night. By this light and more, we see...

     Imam chained into the first harness of the drag-sled. Beside
     him, Johns fumbles with a second harness. Hands help him into
     the chains. The hands belong to...

     Riddick. Both men recognize the irony of the prisoner helping
     his captor into chains.

                              FRY
                         (to all)
               Keep the light going. That's all we have
               to do to live through this. Just keep
               your light burning.

     Riddick loops a handlight over his neck, places it to shine light
     down his back. A beacon.

                              RIDDICK
                         (to Fry)
               Be runnin' about 10 paces ahead. I want
               light on my back -- but not in my eyes.
               And check your cuts. These things know
               our blood now.

     CLOSE on Audrey. Overhearing, she goes stone-faced.

                              FRY
               Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some
               kind of deal. Just in case, you know,
               this actually --

                              RIDDICK
                         (shaking head)
               Had it with deals.

                              FRY
               But I just wanted to say --

                              RIDDICK
               Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose.
               I fuckin' knew better.

     It worries Fry. "If he doesn't expect to go free...."

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               Been a long time since anyone's trusted
               me. That's somethin' right there.

                              FRY
               We can, can't we? Trust you?

                              RIDDICK
               Actually...
                         (completely genuine)
               That's what I been askin' myself.

     He walks away. HOLD on Fry -- wondering if she hasn't made a
     terrible, terrible mistake.


     EXT. NIGHT

     The drag-sled begins moving.

     SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS: Riddick running point, goggles off,
     eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like
     malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side-
     guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position
     carrying an umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling
     along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every
     shadow a threat. They are a train of light.

     CLOSE on the sled. Holding four power cells and eight bottles
     of booze.

     CLOSE on Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Below us run the survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY so that their
     lights become insignificant...so that we include, in FOREGROUND,
     the silhouettes of gliding predators. They're following from
     above, awaiting their chance.


     EXT. NIGHT

     FRY'S POV: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have vanished.

                              JOHNS
               So you noticed too?

                              FRY
               Riddick. Riddick.

     The procession grinds to a halt. Everyone sucks hard on
     breathers as they muster inside the light.

                              FRY
               Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't
               we still following them?

                              RIDDICK
               Saw something I didn't like.

                              JOHNS
               Such as.

                              RIDDICK
               Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me...
               but looked like a bunch of those big boys
               chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought
               we'd swing wide. Okay by you?

     Paris looks over his shoulder. "We went around what?" Nearby
     CLICKING breaks up the confrontation.

                              FRY
               Let's move.
                         (to Audrey)
               Just a detour. He'll get us there.

                              PARIS
               Can we switch?

                              FRY
               What, switch what?

                              PARIS
               I think I twisted my ankle running
               backwards like that. And I'm not sure I
               can....
                         (off their stares)
               Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to
               be alone back there anymore. If you could
               just give me a few minutes up front here --

                              JOHNS
               She's the pilot, she should stay close to
               the cells.

                              PARIS
               Oh, so I'm disposable?

                              FRY
               I'll switch, I'll switch! Christ, just
               get this train moving!


     EXT. NIGHT

     They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner.

     At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING
     never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his
     torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty.

                              PARIS
               Light, please, need light here....

     Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he
     refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl.

     A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam
     lunges at the last nanosecond...

     And flattens Audrey to the ground. Scythe blades swing...

     CHINKING the harness-chains on Imam's back.

     Johns whirls, BLASTS. Light-beams leap around. But the predator
     is long gone.

                              IMAM
                         (trembling)
               Please...have we been cut? Can someone
               tell me if....

     He finds his dropped light, thumbs the switch again and again.
     Broken.

     In the confusion, Paris has been left in the dark. Something
     slashes him from behind. It's like the night has claws.

                              PARIS
               Oh, sweet Jesus....

     The bottle drops.

     The blood flows.

     The CLICKING STOPS.

                              PARIS
               Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME
               LIGHT OVER HERE!

     Faces whip around. But before their lights can rescue him...

     Paris is gone, snatched away by a swooping blur.

     Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of predators feasting on Paris. Carrying a
     youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't
     find a place at the trough. With shocking apathy, it whips the
     youngling off its back and begins devouring it. Other predators
     start in-fighting, killing themselves for food. POV PANS to a
     pair of predators, closer, SOUNDING out new prey. POV PANS
     AGAIN to include the object of their desire. Audrey.

     CLOSE on Riddick. Trying to figure it out.

     CLOSE on Audrey. Listening to the HORRIFIC FEEDING SOUNDS.
     Oblivious to all the attention she's getting.

                              FRY
               What do you see? Riddick?

                              RIDDICK
               Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.


     EXT. SKY - NIGHT

     As clouds mass.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Into a rising wind, the survivors range on.

     Audrey now carries Paris' torch, refueled and COUGHING FIREBALLS
     at regular intervals. Fry seems to be handling rear-point fairly
     well, until...

     The cutter sputters and dies. She ditches it and takes the torch
     from Audrey.

                              FRY
               Bottle-count.

                              AUDREY
               Four fulls, one half. That mean we're
               halfway there? I hope?

     Good question. They've just been blindly following...

     The light on Riddick's back.

                              FRY
               Can we pick up the pace?

     Working like a mule, Johns growls to himself. "If you think you
     can do better...." Abruptly he slaps an arm across Imam's chest,
     spotting...

     A sled-track. In front of them.

     Fry hears a SHOTGUN RATCHET. She spins to see...

     Johns out of his chains. Moving forward. Jamming the shotgun
     into the back of Riddick's neck.

                              JOHNS
               We aren't completely stupid.

                              FRY
               Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in
               the fucking --

                              IMAM
               We crossed our own tracks.

                              JOHNS
               He's running us 'round in circles. Look
               for yourself. Look!

                              FRY
               Riddick? What the hell are you --

                              RIDDICK
               Listen.

     Imagine a hundred Geiger-counters next to a truckload of
     plutonium. That's the SOUND that rides the wind now.

                              RIDDICK
               Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some
               time to think.

                              FRY
               Think about what?

                              JOHNS
               About how to kill us and still get these
               cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just
               doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!

                              RIDDICK
                         (answering Fry)
               About the girl.

                              FRY
               What about her?

                              RIDDICK
               What it's gonna be like when we hit that
               canyon. With her bleeding.

                              JOHNS
               What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not
               cut.

                              RIDDICK
                         (agreeing)
               No. She's not.

     It hits Fry like a two-by-four. She looks at Audrey.

                              AUDREY
                         (confessing)
               I didn't want you to leave me there...
               back at the ship...that's why I didn't
               say anything....

                              FRY
               No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you
               shoulda told me sooner.

                              JOHNS
                         (finally getting it)
               Aw, this can't be happening to me....

                              RIDDICK
               They been nose-open for her ever since we
               left. They go off blood.

                              IMAM
               Well...we must keep her close, then.
               Here, she'll be safe if we put her
               between --

                              RIDDICK
                         (scanning)
               There is no "safe."

     An epic beat. The wind gusts...the FLAMES CHATTER...their ears
     fill with CANYON SOUNDS.

                              FRY
               It's not gonna work. We gotta go back.

     Johns brays.

                              JOHNS
               Hey, you're the one who got me out here,
               turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An'
               now you 'spect me to go back like a
               whipped dog?

                              FRY
               I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay?
               Now let's just go back to the ship.

                              JOHNS
               I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces --
               you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out
               here.

                              FRY
               Are you fucking high again? Just listen
               to --

                              JOHNS
               No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be
               afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of
               meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say
               mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred
               meters, after that we're in Skiff City!
               So why don't you just butch up, stuff a
               cork in that kid, and get --

                              IMAM
               She's the captain, we should listen to --

                              JOHNS
               Listen to her? Her? When she was willing
               to sacrifice us all?

     A beat. Eyes turn to Fry. She wants to protest -- but can't.

                              AUDREY
               What's he talkin' about?

                              JOHNS
               During the crash, she --

                              FRY
                         (a warning growl)
               This does not help us, Johns.

                              JOHNS
               -- she tried to blow the whole fucking
               passenger cabin, tried to kill us --

                              FRY
               Just shut up, okay?

                              JOHNS
               -- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris
               had it right -- we are disposable. We're
               just walking ghosts to her.

                              FRY
               Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!

     She rushes him, ready to rip his eyes out. He shunts her aside.

                              JOHNS
               We're not alive because of her -- we're
               alive in spite of her.

     He swung below the belt -- and connected. Fry's chin quakes,
     her knees fail. The undertow of events finally pulls her down.

                              FRY
               We cannot go through there....

                              JOHNS
                         (lording)
               How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?

                              IMAM
                         (pushing him back)
               Fine, fine, you've made your point. We
               can all be so scared as you.

     Johns snatches a light away from Imam.

                              JOHNS
                         (to all)
               Verdict's in. The light moves forward.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     They trudge on, slower now, building reserves for the canyon-run.
     At rear-point, Fry follows like a broken rudder. Pilgrim #1 now
     draws the sled with Imam. And up ahead...


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     Johns falls in step with Riddick.

                              JOHNS
               Ain't all of us gonna make it.

                              RIDDICK
               Just realized that, huh?

     CLICKING nearby. Johns BLASTS the night, driving the sound
     away -- and reminding everyone of who carries the Big Gauge.

                              JOHNS
               Six of us left. If we could get through
               that canyon and lose just one, that'd be
               quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing,
               right?

                              RIDDICK
               Not if I'm the one.

                              JOHNS
               What if you're one of five?

     Riddick stares. "I'm listening."


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              AUDREY
               What're they doin' up there?

                              IMAM
               Talking about the canyon, I suppose.
               How to get us through.

     Overhearing, Fry looks. It's odd to see Johns and Riddick
     walking side by side, like equals. Like partners.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              JOHNS
               Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no
               different than those battlefield doctors
               when they have to decide who lives and who
               dies. It's called "triage," okay?

                              RIDDICK
               Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.

                              JOHNS
               Either way, figure it's something you can
               grab onto.

                              RIDDICK
                         (doping it out)
               Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave
               it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket
               of chum.

                              JOHNS
               Trawl with it. There's a cable on the
               sled. We can drag the body behind us.

                              RIDDICK
               Nice embellishment.

                              JOHNS
               Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just
               keep 'em off our scent.

                              RIDDICK
                         (looking back)
               So which one caught your eye?

                              JOHNS
               Don' look, don' look, don' look....


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     Fry spots Riddick's look -- and Johns' non-look.

                              FRY
               Imam. Slow down.

                              IMAM
               What?

                              FRY
               Don't stop, just slow down.  Little more
               space 'tween us and them.

                              IMAM
               I would rather we all stay--

                              FRY
               Do what I say. Please.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              RIDDICK
               What's her name, anyway?

                              JOHNS
               What do you care?

     Riddick shrugs. "I don't."

                              JOHNS
               Then let's not name the Thanksgiving
               turkey, okay? I assume you still got a
               shiv.

                              RIDDICK
               What, you 'spect me to do it?

                              JOHNS
               What's one more to you? Like this is the
               one that sends you to Hell?

                              RIDDICK
               Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They
               oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere.
               Or forget the museum -- maybe they should
               just hang you.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     As Fry and the others keep slowing.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

                              JOHNS
               Awright. You do the girl, I'll keep the
               others off your back.

     Riddick stops. Reconsiders.

                              JOHNS (CONT'D)
               Aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.

                              RIDDICK
                         (shakes head)
               Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger
               piece of chum.

                              JOHNS
               Like who, Mr. Chrislam?

     EXTREMELY TIGHT on both men: In their eyes, we see the new
     partnership splintering apart: "Like Mr. Johns."

     Riddick makes a play for the shotgun. It BLASTS skyward.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     As the fight erupts:

                              FRY
               Bring the light!

                              AUDREY
               What're they doing? What're we --

                              FRY
               Leave the sled, let's go, go, go!


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     FIGHT SCENE: Johns' light hits the ground, creating an arena of
     illumination. FAST CLICKING nearby. Still struggling, Riddick
     and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and BLAST THE
     CLICKING AWAY.

     The shotgun goes free. Johns lunges for it, but Riddick kicks it
     into the night. And then pulls his shiv.

                              RIDDICK
               Gotta stay in the light, Johns. That's
               the only rule.

     Johns circles inside the light. Fucking with him, Riddick starts
     poking and jabbing, backing him up against the wail of dark.
     Johns stumbles over something. A bone. A club.

     Riddick finds his own bone-club, and now they go at it like two
     cavemen. Riddick beats on Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers,
     forcing him to drop the bone. Just trying to get away now, Johns
     makes a desperate lunge for the light, but...

     Riddick shivs open his back.

                              RIDDICK
               Remember that moment?

     Gushing blood, Johns starts crawling pathetically with the light.
     Riddick dogs him.

                              RIDDICK
               Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns.
               You were one brave fuck, before. Now look
               at you. Oh, yeah, you were Billy Bad-ass
               with your gauge...with your chains....

     Johns finds the shotgun. "And I'm still Billy Bad-ass." He
     sweeps it around with the light, ready to kill...

     Blackness. Where'd Riddick go?

     CLICKING behind Johns. He whirls to see...

     Something big coming for him. Johns BLASTS IT back into the
     night, dropping the light as he does. Eyes in the back of his
     head, he whirls again and takes aim on...

     Another bull-rushing predator.

     Johns triggers a bad round. Crazed, he ratchets and levels the
     shotgun for another try. He's too late.

     BIG CLOSEUP as the ejected shell rolls to a stop. It's red.
     Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark.

     RIDDICK'S POV: With Johns skewered by the armpits, the predator
     lifts him off the ground and "stares" with a deceptively gentle
     CLICKING-COOING SOUND.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Johns' final expression.

     RIDDICK'S POV: The predator rears back its head -- then slams
     forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade,
     splitting him in two.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Fry, Imam, Audrey, Pilgrim #1. They're running, stumbling,
     trying to backtrack the sled marks. Checking for pursuit, Fry
     looks over her shoulder...

     And crashes into Riddick. He was just standing in the dark,
     waiting for them.

                              RIDDICK
               Back to the ship, huh?

                              FRY
               Get out of our way.

                              RIDDICK
               So everybody huddles together till the
               lights burn out? Until you can't see
               what's eating you? That the big plan?

                              IMAM
               Where's Mr. Johns?

                              RIDDICK
               Which half?

                              IMAM
               You mean....

     Conflicted, they all look back. Audrey starts to puddle up.

                              AUDREY
               Gonna lose everybody out here....

                              RIDDICK
               He died fast. And if we got any choice,
               that's the way we should all go out.
                         (to Audrey, softly)
               Don't you cry for Johns. Don't you dare.


     EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     BLACK SCREEN. We hear the canyon in full cry now -- CLICKING...
     BATTLING BONE-BLADES...MATING CRIES...the RENDING OF FLESH
     and SNAPPING OF TENDON. Far below, twin flames appear as the
     survivors reach the gauntlet. Predators perch in FOREGROUND,
     just hulking silhouettes "watching" from a canyon rim.


     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     They are but five: Fry, Riddick, Audrey, Imam, and Pilgrim #1.
     CLOSE on each face as they listen to the CANYON. There must be
     countless predators ahead.

                              FRY
               How many you see?

                              RIDDICK
               One or two.

                              FRY
               Audrey?

                              AUDREY
               Three full bottles. But almost time to
               refill.

                              FRY
               Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on,
               does it?

                              RIDDICK
               Only see one way. Turn the sled over and
               drag it like that, girl down low. Light
               up everything we got -- and run through
               like dogs on fire.

     A beat.

                              IMAM
                         (understanding)
               The sled as a shield....

                              FRY
               And what about the cells?

                              RIDDICK
               I'll take those.

     She looks at him hard.

                              FRY
               We're just here to carry your light,
               aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.

                              RIDDICK
               Let's drop back an' boot up.


     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT

     START on the power cells. They're been lashed together into one
     queue.

     Working amid the giant bones, Riddick crafts a new harness from
     the old straps. Close behind him, Imam is MUTTERING IN ARABIC.

                              RIDDICK
               What're you doin'?

                              IMAM
               Blessing you like the others.
                         (off his look)
               It's painless.

                              RIDDICK
               And pointless.

                              IMAM
                         (a beat)
               I see. Well, even if you don't believe
               in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --

                              RIDDICK
               You don't see.

     Riddick shrugs into the harness, snugs it down.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               'Cuz you don't spend half your life in
               lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth
               and not believe. And you surely don't
               start out in a liquor store trash bin with
               an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck
               and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe
               in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.

                              IMAM
               He will be with us. Nonetheless.

                              RIDDICK
               Give my blessing to the girl. She needs
               a spare.


     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     The torches. Maxed out. Burning non-stop.

     Fry and Imam. Sled chains on. Lapping up O2. Each holding a
     torch.

     Pilgrim #1. Clutching a handlight.

     Audrey. Rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a
     metal carapace.

     Riddick. Goggles on. He has no desire to see what horrors will
     surround them. There's just one path, anyway: Straight through.

                              RIDDICK
               As fast as you can.

                              FRY
               You sure you can keep --

                              RIDDICK
               As fast as you can.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     SLEW OF SHOTS: Fry and Imam on the move, dragging the shield
     fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping along
     behind the shield. And Riddick behind them all, face already
     tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet
     somehow keeping pace. The torch flames, stretched by the wind,
     flank them in fire.


     EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     As predators launch from the rim.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     First come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces --
     then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light. Next
     come FERAL SOUNDS overhead.

                              RIDDICK
               Don't look.

     Thin blue liquid spatters them.

                              RIDDICK
               Do not look up.

     More spattering. Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds...

     A ceiling of predators. At the cusp of light, they dive and
     weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND
     OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry
     eels.

                              RIDDICK
               Keep going, keep going, keep going,
               keep going!

     His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry
     keeps her eyes down and speed up.

     More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping
     out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself?

                              IMAM
                         (a muttered mantra)
               "So dark the clouds around my way
                    I cannot see,
               But through the darkness I believe
                    God leadeth me.
               I gladly place my hand in His when
                    all is dim,
               And, closing my weary eyes, lean
                    hard on him...."

     Now WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them, victims
     of in-fighting. Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly
     mess.

     Pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: A blade slices his leg,
     drawing blood. He keeps his mouth shut.


     EXT. CHOKE-POINT - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     The passage narrows into a choke-point. Fry sees it first.

                              FRY
               Riddick? RIDDICK?

     Ahead, a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon.

                              AUDREY
               What? What is it?

                              RIDDICK
               It's a fucking staircase! Go over it!
               GO OVER IT!

     Steeling themselves, they start climbing.

     But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her
     hands. Then, taking exception at being walked on...

     One "corpse" snaps at her. Audrey recoils sideways...

     And tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed.

     PREDATORS' POV: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes from 10
     different predators.

                              FRY
               Audrey!

     Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as...

     A predator kamikazes onto the shield, its bone-blades piercing
     the metal...

     And nearly skewering Audrey beneath.

     Caught in torchlight, steaming, the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries
     to rip free of the shield.

     Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing.

     The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at...

     Riddick, standing at light's edge. Stunningly, he catches the
     beast under its scythe blades, blunting the attack. The predator
     CLICKS MADLY at him.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick's face.

     The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with
     its skull-blade.

     Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand...

     ...yanks his shiv...

     ...and sweeps it over the belly of the beast. HOWLING, the
     predator falls, disemboweled.

     REACTION SHOTS of Fry and Imam. Stunned.

                              RIDDICK
               Didn't know who he was fuckin' with.

     They regroup. Imam's head swivels back and forth: They're one
     person short.

                              IMAM
               Suleiman!

                              RIDDICK
               Get the girl back under. Keep going.

                              IMAM
               SULEIMAN!

                              RIDDICK
               KEEP GOING OR I WILL!

     Suddenly Pilgrim #1 reappears, thrust back into the light by
     unseen forces. He's still alive -- but shouldn't be. He makes
     a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam, to anyone, but he's gone
     again before they can even react, jerked out of the light. Out
     of existence.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     They flail on. And now, finally...finally....

     The canyon widens, opening up like some door to Heaven. The
     WORST SOUNDS fall behind. We can see it in their sweat-sheened
     faces: The faintest hope that maybe they've survived the Seventh
     Circle of Hell. But then...

     The TORCHES SPIT AND SPUTTER.

     Audrey hears PATTERING on the metal shield.

     Blood falls anew.

     One torch dies -- yet somehow comes back to life.

     Imam upturns a hand, checking the liquid for color. But this
     blood has no hue.

                              FRY
               Oh, no. No, no, no....

                              IMAM
               Rain.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     RAIN MONTAGE: Water rilling, running, flowing over rocks and
     ground.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Caught in a downpour, the survivors slog to a stop. One torch
     goes out -- and won't relight.

                              RIDDICK
               So where the hell's God now, huh?
                         (no answer from Imam)
               I'll tell you where! He's up there
               PISSING ON ME!

                              FRY
               Riddick? How close?

     Riddick sheds goggles to look ahead. We don't know what he
     sees -- nor what he's thinking.

                              FRY
               Tell me the settlement is right there!
               RIDDICK, PLEASE!

                              RIDDICK
               We can't make it.

     HOLD on Fry's anguished face, rendered in dying torchlight.
     Somewhere behind, the AWFUL SOUNDS RETURN.

                              RIDDICK
               Here...hide here....

     He's found a crevice in the canyon wall.

                              RIDDICK
               Inside...inside....


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     They crawl into the fissure. The second torch dies behind them.


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     There's just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his
     back. By its glow, we watch him lift the shield, muscle it over
     to the crevice...


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     ...and slide it over the opening. A black beat.

                              AUDREY
                         (a beat)
               Why's he still out there?

     Fry's not sure. Is he protecting them? Or entombing them?


     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Working like Sisyphus, Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise.
     He stops at the top, peers through the rain.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of the settlement.

     Riddick disappears over the rise. The four cells follow,
     slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

                              AUDREY
               He's not coming back, is he?

     Fry checks Imam's face. Did Riddick say anything to you?" Imam
     wags his head. A bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she can see
     his face.

                              FRY
               There's light in here.

     It's a soft glow from above. Imam climbs higher to discover
     small blue-white lights clinging to rocks. He plucks a few.

                              FRY
               What are they?

     CLOSE on the lights in Imam's palm. They writhe with life.

                              IMAM
               Larva....

                              AUDREY
               Glow worms....

                              FRY
                         (mind racing)
               How many bottles we got? Empty ones?


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Riddick boards the dark craft.

     Connects the power cells to the battery bay.

     Watches the ship come to life.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a liquor bottle. It's half full of glow-worms.

                              AUDREY
               More, more, we need more....

     They climb higher. Little by little, the bottle brightens their
     world.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff,
     looking out into dark rain. Is he struggling with a decision?
     Or just savoring the safe harbor? Then very deliberately...

     Riddick smashes his handlight on the hull. He steps inside and
     closes the hatch behind him.


     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Something claws its way up the rise. Standing, we see that it's
     Fry, a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck. Ahead she
     spies...

     The settlement. Silhouetted by engine-light.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     As the skiffs ENGINES WARM UP.


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     As Riddick dabbles with flight controls.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     As Fry, running, splashes past buildings.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Audrey and Imam huddle around a bottle of glow-worms: This is
     all they could harvest. Presently SCRABBLING SOUNDS on the
     shield. Imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield. He
     can't see much until...

     A blade rushes through the hole. Imam recoils hard, snatches up
     the glow-worm light to see...

     More predator blades exploring the edges of the shield. The
     light drives them away. For now.


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Riddick dims interior lights, activates exterior lights. He's
     actually startled by the sight of...

     Fry. Standing in the skiffs headbeams. Daring him to run her
     over.

     Eye-lock.

     Riddick opens the hatch.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     They meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- Fry in the rain,
     Riddick in the light.

                              RIDDICK
               Strong survival instinct. Admire that in
               a woman.

                              FRY
               You're not leaving. Not until we go back
               for the others.

     He laughs at that.

                              FRY (CONT'D)
               I promised them we'd go back with more
               light. And that's exactly what we're
               gonna do..

                              RIDDICK
               Think you've mistaken me for somebody who
               gives a fuck.

                              FRY
               What, you're afraid?

                              RIDDICK
               Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was
               his monkey. I only deal in life and
               death. All that stuff in between? Some
               shade of grey my eyes don't see.

                              FRY
               I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I
               trusted that some part of you wanted to
               rejoin the human race.

                              RIDDICK
               Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.

     Fry realizes it's impossible to shame a shameless man. With
     desperation edging her voice:

                              FRY
               Then wait for me. I'll go back myself.
               Just give me more light for them.

     He tosses her a light. The broken one.

                              FRY
               Just come with me!

                              RIDDICK
               Got a better idea. Come with me.

     Fry's mouth moves but nothing comes out.

                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)
               They're already dead. Get on board.

                              FRY
               You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.

                              RIDDICK
               'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't
               leave you here. If you believe anything
               about me, better be that.

                              FRY
               No, you see, I promised them...I have
               to...I have to go and....

     She's bleeding resolve. Riddick can see it -- can smell it --
     and he keeps slashing away.

                              RIDDICK
               Step aboard, Carolyn.

                              FRY
                         (tortured)
               I can't....I can't....

                              RIDDICK
                         (approaching, extending
                          a hand)
               Here. Make it easy on you.

                              FRY
               Don't do this to me....

                              RIDDICK
               Just give me your hand.

                              FRY
               But they...they could still be....

                              RIDDICK
               No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my
               hand and save yourself, Carolyn.

     A beat. She takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway.
     They sprawl through mud. She gets a knee on his neck.

                              FRY
               I will not give up on them! I Will not
               leave anyone on this rock with those
               fucking things, even if it means --

     In a blur, Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck. Is
     history repeating itself? Riddick's face, though, is strangely
     calm. Curious. Even gentle.

                              RIDDICK
               You'd die for them?

                              FRY
               I would try for them.

                              RIDDICK
               You barely know them.

                              FRY
               But I'm human. I know you view that as a
               weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear,
               theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes.
               I would die for them.


     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     MORE SCRABBLING at the shield. Imam cocks his blade back, ready
     to do battle with...

     Fry. She heaves the shield aside. Behind her, Riddick.

                              AUDREY
                         (big-eyed)
               You came for us....

                              RIDDICK
               Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed.
               Anyone not ready for this?


     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

     Protected by the meager light of two glow-worm bottles, the four
     remaining survivors head out.

                              RIDDICK
               Tighter, tighter....


     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT

                              RIDDICK
               Stop.

     They pile up awkwardly. Fry listens hard. Only RAINFALL.

                              FRY
               I don't hear --

     He covers her mouth.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Water has pooled at the base of the muddy rise.
     A predator drinks there.

                              RIDDICK
                         (on his breath)
               Doesn't see us...wait for it to leave....

     RIDDICK'S POV: Another predator lands to drink. Then another.
     Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major
     gathering place.

     Soon they all can hear CLICKING above the RAIN. Their nightmare
     is far from over.

                              RIDDICK
               Get behind me.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the
     pool. A slim gap appears.

                              RIDDICK
               When I go, we go. Full-throttle.

     CLOSE on their hands, gripping each other.

                              RIDDICK
               Ready...ready....

     RIDDICK'S POV: The gap between predators widens into a passage.
     A gauntlet within a gauntlet.

     Riddick runs. Linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of a predator turning to "stare" over its
     shoulder.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick bearing down fast.

     The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing
     through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to
     reach...

     The muddy rise. Audrey loses her grip on the others...

     And starts back-sliding. She CRIES OUT, turning the head of...

     Riddick. He catches Audrey as her legs hit the pool. He muscles
     her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her
     slip-sliding down the other side.

                              RIDDICK
               You know the way!

     Not waiting for him, Fry and Imam disappear over the rise.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of the predators. Regrouping. Crawling up the
     rise at us.


     EXT. NIGHT

     Fry, Imam, and Audrey run hard, glow-worm lights bouncing wildly.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Chasing them.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Chasing Riddick.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     Fry, Imam, and Audrey reach the settlement. They spill around a
     corner and see...

     The light of the skiff.


     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

     RIDDICK'S POV: Ahead of us, we see Fry, Imam, and Audrey
     vanishing around the corner. BREATHING LIKE A RACEHORSE, we
     follow in their steps, storming around the same corner. Suddenly
     a predator is right there, right in our face.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick skidding to a stop. He snaps a look
     up.

     RIDDICK'S POV: Of another predator perched gargoyle-like on the
     building. It SPEED-CLICKS at us.

     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick slowly pulling two shivs. Bracing
     himself. Ready to blade it out.


     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     Imam and Audrey stagger aboard. Safe in the light of the
     headbeams, Fry turns back, panting, waiting.

     Waiting.

                              IMAM
               Captain....

     He wants her to board the skiff. Fry gives it another beat, eyes
     sweeping the dark rain. And just when we think it's over for
     Riddick -- TERRIBLE SCREAMS are heard from both man and predator:
     There's a helluva fight going on out there. Close out there.

     Fry snatches the glow-worms off Imam's neck...

     And plunges into the darkness, homing in on the SOUNDS until...

     A blade flashes in her face. She ducks and spots...

     Riddick. Bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to
     fight off the shadow-beasts that swirl and slash all around him.
     Around them both.

                              FRY
               It's me, it's me, it's me!

     She gets the light around his neck. Now we see his face
     clearly -- and see a very human expression there: Fear. Fry
     grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up.

                              FRY
               C'mon, Riddick -- said I'd die for them,
               not you.

     He gets his feet under him. Gripping each other, they start
     moving, turning like dancers in a macabre waltz, hoping the
     predators can't fix on Riddick's blood.

                              FRY
               Just 10 steps...keep turning, keep
               turning...that's right...others're already
               'board, waitin' for us right now...five
               steps...c'mon, almost there, Riddick...
               almost there...we're almost --

     Something jolts them. ALL CLICKING STOPS.

     EXTREME CLOSEUPS: Searching each other's eyes. Someone just got
     slashed from behind, slashed bad. But who?

                              RIDDICK
               Not for me....

     In an eyeblink she's gone, ripped from his arms. There was no
     scream. No cry. No final words. Just...

     Blackness.


     EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NIGHT

     Out of the blackness, a spot of fire races toward us. It
     resolves into the skiff, fabric wings burning off as it hits
     escape velocity.


     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT

     CLOSE on a bloody hand. It toggles through nav-charts, plots a
     rendezvous with "Sol-Track 17B" shipping lane.

     In the cockpit, Riddick finds Audrey beside him. She stares
     hypnotically at the stars ahead.

                              RIDDICK
               Probably okay to talk to me now.

                              AUDREY
               Not sure where to go. I was just runnin'
               away when this whole thing started.
                         (a beat)
               Where you goin'?

                              RIDDICK
               Not sure. I was just runnin' away when
               this whole thing....

     Interior smiles. Stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes
     a course-correction. One very bright star comes into view.

                              RIDDICK
               Might interest you....

     Imam moves forward. Seeing, his face lifts.

                              IMAM
               New Mecca....

                              RIDDICK
               Think a soul could get lost there? With
               all those pilgrim-types?

                              IMAM
               It's more a place where souls are found,
               Mr. Riddick.

     As Riddick ponders the possibilities, we CUT TO...


     EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NEW DAWN

     The first sun flares out from behind the eclipsing planet. Its
     light feels cleansing. Renewing. Life-giving.

         FADE IN


   1     EXT. OUTER SPACE                                       1

         The infinite blackness punctuated by a billion stars.
         As we slowly DESCEND through the varied shades of blue
         of the Earth's atmosphere, we HEAR the first strains of
         a haunting, Central American FLUTE, joined by a swelling
         background of JUNGLE SOUNDS.  We descend further,
         through a lush JUNGLE CANOPY, backlit by a setting sun.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



   2     EXT. JUNGLE COASTLINE - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)               2

         Through a collage of shimmering HEAT-WAVES, a dark,
         OTHER-WORLDLY OBJECT drops INTO VIEW, backlit by the
         fiery, ORANGE-RED sphere of a setting tropical SUN,
         heading slowly towards us, floating, as if suspended by
         the rising heat of the jungle.

         Continuing to approach, the shimmering object resolves
         into a MILITARY ASSAULT HELICOPTER, its rotors strobing
         in the fading sunlight.  Drawing closer, the SOUND of
         powerful TURBINES, throbbing in the heavy air, becomes
         dominant, overpowering.

         Guided by COLORED SMOKE and LANDING LIGHTS, the chopper
         looms hard INTO VIEW, pitching forward and settling to
         the ground, kicking up a maelstrom of dust and vegetation



   2-A   INT. COMMAND POST - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)                   2-A  *

         Where a MAN wearing a military UNIFORM watches through
         the large open windows the helicopter as it continues
         to approach.  Before the skids have even touched down he
         SEES the first of the MEN, dressed in CIVILIAN CLOTHES
         but carrying full COMBAT GEAR, alight gracefully from
         the chopper, double-timing in close order to one side,
         the orders SHOUTED by one man lost in the ROAR of the
         chopper.

         The man turns away from the window, to a FIGURE, hidden     *
         in the shadows.

                                 MAN                                 *   
                  He's here.

         He turns back, lowering a BAMBOO SHADE, obscuring the       *   
         window.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                2



   2-B   EXT. HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT                            2-B  *

         On adjoining PADS, two other HELICOPTERS are VISIBLE; in
         the b.g. can be SEEN several concrete and THATCHWORK
         BUILDINGS, a secret command post disguised as a COASTAL
         FISHING VILLAGE.

         The post in a flurry of activity, AMERICAN ADVISORS
         shouting directions to dozens of LATIN AMERICAN SOLDIERS
         who stand by to assist the landing helicopter and to
         load EQUIPMENT into the other choppers.

         Inside the chopper, one man remains, stretched out against  *
         the bulkhead, as if asleep.  He stirs, sits up, lighting    *
         up a CIGAR.  With fatigue showing in his motion, he leans   *
         forward, descending to the ground.                          *

         A JEEP pulls to stop, the man swinging casually into the    *
         front seat, tossing his GEAR into the rear.  With a         *
         lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post.          *

         In the doorway TWO MEN solemnly watch as the jeep
         approaches.  Reaching the command post the man alights
         from the jeep, heading towards the two men.

         Into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the
         door steps MAJOR ALAN SCHAEFER, the team leader, 38, an
         intelligent and intense man.  He informally salutes,
         GENERAL H.L. PHILIPS, 55, hardened, close-cropped graying
         hair, his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a
         member of an elite commando unit in the U.S. Army.  He
         clasps Schaefer warmly on the shoulder.

                                 PHILIPS
                         (with affection)
                  You're looking well, Dutch.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  It's been a long time, General.

         They walk up the stairs, entering the palapa, leaving
         the other man on guard.



   3     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                      3

         Large, two room concrete floor, thatched walls and roof.
         Behind a partially drawn curtain in the kitchen, a naked
         lightbulb hung from the rafters illuminates a bank of
         compact FIELD RADIO EQUIPMENT, MAPS and AERIAL
         PHOTOGRAPHS.  Otherwise the rooms are primitive and
         stand out in stark contrast to this high-tech invasion.

         Philips and Schaefer enter the room.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

   3     CONTINUED                                              3

                                 PHILIPS
                         (growing serious)
                  We've got a real problem here,
                  something right up your alley.

         They cross to the center of the room to a folding table,
         covered with a large TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP of the Central
         American highland jungle.  Philips leans over the table,
         circling a set of COORDINATES and a MARK on the open
         map.

                                 PHILIPS
                  Eighteen hours ago I was
                  informed that one of our
                  choppers, transporting three
                  presidential cabinet members
                  from this charming little
                  country, was shot down...
                         (point to
                         the circled
                         area)
                  ...The pilots radioed from the
                  ground that they were all
                  alive.  Their position was
                  fixed by the transponder
                  beacon onboard the chopper.
                         (points)
                  Here.

         Schaefer studies the map.  He looks up at Philips.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  That's over the border,
                  General.

                                 PHILIPS
                         (dead serious)
                  That's the problem.  Apparently
                  they strayed off course.
                         (pause)
                  We're certain they've been
                  captured by the guerrillas.

         Schaefer looks up, puffing lightly on the cigar.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (quietly)
                  What have you got in mind,
                  General.

   3     CONTINUED:  (2)                                        3

                                 PHILIPS
                  We figure we've got less than
                  twenty-four hours to catch
                  up with them.  After that,
                  there's not much hope.  We
                  want a rescue operation
                  mounted tonight.  That doesn't
                  give you much time.

         Another puff on the cigar.

                                 SCHAEFER   
                  What else it new?  When do
                  we leave?

         Philips looks at his watch.

                                 PHILIPS
                  You lift off in three hours.
                         (pause)
                  There's one other thing.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What's that, General?

                                 PHILIPS
                  Someone else will be going
                  in with you.

         Schaefer stubbs out his cigar in an ashtray.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You know we don't work with
                  outsiders, General.

                                 VOICE
                         (o.s.)
                  Who said anything about
                  outsiders, Dutch?

         Schaefer turns, SEEING the outline of a figure standing
         in the doorway of the communications room, holding a
         sheaf of PAPERS.

         Wearing pressed fatigues, DILLON, mid-thirties, black,
         walks into the room.

         Although as rugged looking as the others, his bearing
         and grooming indicate he's been away from the business
         of soldiering for sometime.  His quick intelligent eyes
         reveal his current profession.

                                 DILLON
                  Last time we danced, it was
                  Lieutenant, Schaefer.

         A grin breaks out across Schaefer's face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Dillon, you son of a bitch.

         The two men step forward and simultaneous swing from
         the hip as it to land a punch...but their hands SLAP
         together in a gesture of friendship, their forearms
         bulging, testing each other's strength.

                                 DILLON
                         (warmly)
                  How you been, Dutch?

         They continue the contest, Schaefer has the edge, forcing
         Dillon's arm slowly downward.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You've been pushing too many
                  Pencils, Dillon.  Had enough?

                                 DILLON
                         (grinning)
                  No way, old buddy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You never did know when to
                  quit.

         They look into each other's faces, each remembering
         something from the past.  A moment's hesitation and they
         quit the contest.  They laugh, Dillon slapping Schaefer
         on the shoulder.

                                 DILLON
                  That piece of work you guys
                  pulled off at the Berlin
                  embassy last week was really
                  something.  Blew the entry
                  points on three floors and
                  neutralized the opposition
                  in eight seconds flat.
                  Beautiful.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Like the old days, Dillon.

                  Also heard that you passed
                  on that little job in Libya.

         Schaefer looks at Dillon, quietly considering him.

                  Those cabinet members are
                  very important to our scope
                  of operations in this part
                  of the world.  They're about
                  to get squeezed.  We can't
                  let that happen.  I needed
                  someone who could get the job
                  done, quick and quiet...no
                  screw-ups.  I needed the best.
                  The best.  So, I pulled a few
                  strings at the State
                  Department...and here we are.

         Dillon goes to the map.

                  The set-up is simple, Dutch.
                  One day job.  We pick up their

                  down, grab the hostages and
                  bounce back across the

                  we were there.  You've done

                  I'm afraid those are your

                  will evaluate the situation
                  and take charge.

         Schaefer looks from Philips to Dillon.  He still doesn't
         like it.

   4     EXT. TWO ASSAULT HELICOPTERS - NIGHT                   4

         Burst over the top of a ridge.  Rising up in silhouette
         they perform a radical left bank turn and descend
         rapidly into an adjoining valley, racing over the
         jungle at treetop level.

         As the helicopters perform dizzying, high-speed
         maneuvers through the winding canyon, the PILOT'S
         VOICES can be HEARD, coordinating their operations.

         The helicopters rise in perfect coordination over
         another ridge and bank sharply into the next valley,
         leveling out as they go.



   5     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                                5

         Illuminated by the eerie red glow of NIGHT LIGHTS, are
         SEVEN MEN, dressed in jungle camouflage, soft hats and
         camouflage face-makeup.  They wear no identity badges
         or insignias.  The man are checking their WEAPONS,
         making last minute adjustments to their GEAR.

         The compartment reverberates with the NOISE of the
         THUMPING ROTORS and the ROAR of air from the open
         doors.

         BLAIN, weapons and ordinance specialist, a frightening
         bull of a man, a 240 pound killer, removes from his
         shirtpocket a think PLUG OF TOBACCO.  He looks across
         at:

         MAC, a huge bear of a man, black, holding am M-60
         MACHINE GUN.  Blain holds out the tobacco to Mac who
         refuses with a gentle shake of the head, a knowing
         smile, he knows what's coming.

         Holding the plug between his teeth Blain yanks free
         from his shoulder scabbard a wicked, ten inch COMBAT
         KNIFE.  Placing the razor sharp blade next to his lips
         he slices through the plug as if it were butter.  He
         chews throughtfully.

         Seated by the open doorway is RAMIREZ, a slight,
         angular man, an East L.A. streetwise Chicano.

         Adding a final piece of camouflage TAPE to his pack
         HARNESS, he looks up and smiles, faking a throw and
         the bulleting the tape to:

         HAWKINS, the radioman and medic, Irish, street-tough,
         reading a rolled-up magazine, as if he were a rush hour
         commuter.  He snags the tape with an instinctual snap

         of the wrist, continuing to read for a moment before
         looking up, grinning at Ramirez, his boyish, eager
         face belying the rugged professional beneath.  He
         turns his gaze to the man next to him:

         BILLY, the Kit Carson Scout, an American Indian, proud,
         stoic, a man of quiet strength and simplicity,
         carefully replacing the FIRING MECHANISM of his M-203,
         working its action several times.  He looks up with a
         smile at Hawkins.

                                 HAWKINS
                         (shouting)
                  Hey, Billy, how many marines
                  does it take to eat a squirrel?

         Billy looks back, shaking his head, uncomprehending.

                                 HAWKINS
                  Two.  One to eat it and one
                  to watch for cars.

         Hawkins laughs heartily at his joke.



   6     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT                                    6

         Clearing another ridge, the helicopters plunge into a
         steep descent, turning quickly into a DEEP-WALLED
         CANYON, the force of the turn accentuated by the
         changing PITCH of the screaming turbines and the
         biting of rotors into the air.



   7     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                                7

         The men, suspended in RESTRAINING HARNESSES from the
         bulkheads, lean forward, nearly upside down in response
         to the radical maneuver, handling the situation with
         ease.

         Blain holds out the tobacco to Ramirez, who swats at
         the offending object as if it were alive.

         Grinning, Blain proffers the plug to each man, each one
         refusing; they've done it a thousand times.  It's an old
         gag but they obviously care for the man in a big way.

                                 BLAIN
                  ...bunch of slack-jawed

                  just like me.

         This brings a chorus of HOOTS and SHOUTS from the others.
         The helicopter makes another radical turn.

         Schaefer and Dillon, seated near the cockpit, communicate
         through HEADSETS, also linked to the pilot.  They
         consult a TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP by RED PENLIGHTS.

         The PILOT and CO-PILOT are surrounded by an array of
         dimly lit GAUGES and SWITCHES.  Before the Co-Pilot is
         a RADAR SCREEN and an INFRA-RED DISPLAY TERMINAL on

         A BLUE LIGHT appears on the forward bulkhead.  Schaefer
         is speaking over a RADIO TELEPHONE.  The Co-Pilot turns
         and hands him a clipboard.  Schaefer reads, notes his
         approval and hands it back.

         Dillon seems comfortable with the men, showing Ramirez
         a battered CIGARETTE LIGHTER from a famed commando
         unit from the past.

         But his ingratiating demeanor is not impressing Mac, who
         regards Dillon with the cold suspicion reserved for an
         outsider.  Mac looks up at Blain, his eyes narrowing.

         Blain's massive jaws roll as he masticates the chew.
         He pauses, eyes moving downward, spotting his target.

         He hocks a thick, vile stream of TOBACCO JUICE directly
         between Dillon's legs and onto the floor, a gelatinous
         skein lacing across the toe of one boot.  Dillon looks
         up, his face goes cold and menacing.

         Dillon turns back to Ramirez, ignoring Mac and Blain,
         who continues to stare at him.  Mac looks across at
         Blain, wide grins breaking across their huge faces.
         Cradled in Blain's arms, as if it were a part of his
         body, is a large, CANVAS-COVERED BUNDLE.  Blain looks
         down at his bundle, almost affectionately.

         The PILOT's VOICE breaks in over Schaefer's headset.

         man who nods and in return,passes the signal down the
         line.

         Ramirez and Blain pick up heavy, METAL CONICAL DEVICES,
         attached to canvas bags filled with rope.

                  You never were all that
                  smart...let's go!!!

         Schaefer signals.  Men leap from the chopper.



  14     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT                                   14

         The man crash through the trees and are swallowed up by
         the darkness below.  The helicopters depart, THUMPING
         their way into the night.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



  15     EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY (DAWN)                      15

         A light shower passes through the trees.  The sky
         clears, REVEALING a lush and exotic foliage.  Birds
         are beginning to SING but otherwise, all is SILENT.

         The dense growth seems impenetrable, but from a solid
         wall of undergrowth, a HAND appears and signals in a
         downward motion.

         As if by magic, the assault team materializes, quietly,
         cautiously.  Schaefer makes another gesture and the team
         moves forward in perfect harmony in POINT-LOCK step,
         taking their cue from Ramirez, the pointman.  Schaefer,
         highly focused and alert to every sound and movement,
         follows Ramirez, as if organically connected.



  16     EXT. JUNGLE HILLSIDE - DAY                            16

         Descending the steep mountain slope, the team encounters
         an even denser growth of jungle, at times moving by
         instinct, as they are often visually separated.  At one
         point, Schaefer checks his COMPASS, flashing some hand
         signals to Ramirez, indicating a new direction.  Ramirez
         nods and moves on, Schaefer signaling to the rest of the
         men.



  17     EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY                            17

         Blain, in a defensive position, sweeps the jungle slowly
         with his MP-5.  He steps back and turns, checking,
         revealing in the b.g. the WRECKAGE OF A U.S. ARMY UH-1H
         HELICOPTER, hanging upside down, twenty feet above the
         ground, entangled in vines in the heavy capony, badly
         damaged, rotors bent, its tail section blown away.

  17     CONTINUED:                                            17

         A GRAPPLING HOOK is hurled from the ground, CLATTERING
         into the cargo hold, hooking the edge of the airframe.



  18     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                 18

         Ramirez moves cautiously, searching for trip wires,
         using his knife to check the edges of the seats and
         door frames.  Grimly he glances at the TWO BODIES
         slumped over the controls and then exits, snapping
         into and rappelling down the rope to the ground.

         He joins Schaefer standing in the f.g.  They look
         up, watching as Dillon moves through the cockpit,
         searching through pockets and compartments.  Schaefer
         turns his back to the helicopter.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  The pilots have each got one
                  round in the head.  And whoever
                  hit it stripped the shit out of it.

         Schaefer studies the clearing, eyes always moving, wary.
         He turns back, looking at the chopper.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Took 'em out with a heat seeker.

                                 RAMIREZ    
                  There's something else, Major...

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Mmmnnn...?

                                 RAMIREZ
                  I don't think that was any ordinary
                  army taxi...

         Schaefer looks at him quizically.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  ...looks more like a surveillance
                  bird to me.

         Dillon rappells down the line and approaches.

                                 DILLON   
                  Have you picked up their trail yet?

         Schaefer taps Ramirez on the shoulder and he moves
         away.  Schaefer turns to Dillon:

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Billy's on it.
                         (indicates chopper)
                  Heat seeker.  Pretty sophisticated
                  for half-asses mountain boys.

                                 DILLON
                  They're getting better equipped
                  every day.

         Bill approaches from the b.g.

                                 BILLY
                  Major, looks like there were ten,
                  maybe twelve guerrillas.  Looks
                  like they took some prisoners
                  from the chopper.
                         (points)
                  Then a different set of track,
                  over there.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (puzzled)
                  What do you mean?

                                 BILLY
                  Six others, U.S. issue jungle
                  boots.  They came in from the
                  north, then followed the guerrillas.

         Schaefer turns to Dillon.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Mean anything to you?

                                 DILLON
                  Probably another rebel patrol.
                  They operate in here all the time.

         Schaefer is obviously concerned about this.  He
         turns to Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Get ahead, see what you can find.
                         (to Ramirez)  
                  Slow and easy.

                  We don't want any accidents.

         Billy takes up the trail, disappearing in to the jungle.
         Ramirez signals, the team moves out.



  19     EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                     19

         As Billy reconnoiters, Ramirez looks back and gives a       *
         sign...

         Schaefer nods and rappels down cliff.                       *   

         As he joins Ramirez, there seem to be butterflies           *   
         everywhere --         
         

                                 SCHAEFER                            *

                  Same business, guerrillas
                  hauling two guys from the
                  chopper...followed by men
                  with American equipment...

         Ramirez seems concerned by this.  Schaefer signals him to   *
         move on.  Before he follows, Schaefer looks around:  there's*
         something dodgy about this.  He goes.                       *

         Over his head is a butterfly on a limb:                     *



  20     EXT. JUNGLE - OVERHEAD - DAY                          20

         As the assault team passes below, a BUTTERFLY lands on
         what appears to be the BARK of a TREE.  It fans its wings
         and flies on.

         The impression of the butterfly remains in PERFECT
         RELIEF, as is imprinted on the bark.  The image fades,
         REVEALING for an instant a gridwork of TINY SCALES on
         the bark.

         The bark moves!  Changing colors, like a chameleon,
         REVEALING for an instant the form of something alive
         as it flows into the leaves, once again becoming
         indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage.

         TWO EYES, faintly flowing yellow, appear in the
         foliage.  They blink, disappearing, and then become
         VISIBLE again.

         SEEN THROUGH HEAT-SEEKING VISION, studying the team's
         careful, silent movements at they pass by.

         The SOUNDS of the FOREST are also ALTERED and ENHANCED
         with an electric, STATICLIKE quality.

         The Observer scans over the men...and then focuses
         on Schaefer as he crouches down, signaling forward
         and rear with a circular motion.  He refers to an
         OBJECT in his hand, studying it carefully.

         Using a MAP in lining out a course on his COMPASS.  The
         other team members appear, silently, clustering around
         him.  Using hand signals, Schaefer indicates a course
         change.

  26     EXT. DENSE UNDERGROWTH - DAY                          26

         The hillside of a steep valley, dark and foreboding.
         Billy passes by and halts, removing his KNIFE.  With
         his other hand he pulls down from overhead a THICK VINE,
         severing it.  A thin stream of WATER emerges which
         he drinks.

         Suddenly he stops, letting the water drip to the
         ground.  He quietly releases the vine and brings his
         M-203 shotgun to bear, listening intently.  Something
         seems wrong.  He brings his eyes upward and stares,
         hard into the treeline of the opposing hillside.

         As his eyes strain to penetrate the dense, intertwined
         canopy, he is engulfed by the rising SOUNDS of the
         JUNGLE, a cacophony of BUZZING and CLICKING,
         amplified in the sweltering heat of the day.  Unable
         to locate a source to account for his anxiety, he
         relaxes, moving on, resuming the track.



  27     BILLY (MINUTES LATER)                                 27

         examines the ground as he moves, growing confused
         and puzzled by what he sees before him.  He stops,
         scrutinizing the jungle, probing the world around him
         with his keen senses.

         HEARING a faint RUSTLING SOUND he looks up, SEEING a
         curtain of MOSS several feet away.  He takes a cautious
         step forward, extending his weapon.  He reaches
         forward with his free hand, touching the moss.

         Behind the curtain a slight shifting of DARK FORMS
         occurs.  He pauses and then with a sudden movement,
         sweeps the moss aside...

         A BLACK EXPLOSION of FLUTTERING WINGS as carrion-eating
         BIRDS rush past Billy's body.

  27     CONTINUED:                                            27

         Billy's face seizes into a mask of horror, his
         expression descending into a state of complete,
         primitive shock, his eyes staring transfixed, inches
         away from the leering death-grin of a HUMAN FACE,
         upside down, completely stripped of skin.

         Reeling, his body numbed by the sight before him,
         he stumbles backwards and stops.

         Vines threaded through their achilles tendons, the
         BODIES OF THREE MEN, skinned and gutted, hang
         suspended in the think, suffocating air, BUZZING
         with insects.

         Billy turns away, revulsed as Ramirez moves quietly
         INTO VIEW, Schaefer directly behind him.  Ramirez
         stares at the bodies, now seen to be in the first
         stages of deterioration, strips of flesh torn away
         by the birds and other scavengers.  In an almost
         childlike manner, he crosses himself.

                                 RAMIREZ   
                         (hoarse whisper)  
                  Holy Mother...

         Schaefer moves into the clearing, kneeling beside
         a bloody pile of CLOTHING and ENTRAILS.  He examines
         the clothing and then rises, holding a DOG TAG on
         a broken chain.  He reads the tag, his face growing
         hardened and bitter as he stares down at the tag,
         recognizing the name.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to himself)
                  J.S. Davis, Captain, U.S. Army...

         Schaefer's eyes move from the bloody dog tag to
         the bodies.

                                 SCHAEFER   
                         (coldly)  
                  Mac.  Cut them down.

         Mac moves forward, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE.
         The blade flashes, cutting the vine as the first
         body THUDS to the ground.  He bends over, picking up
         other DOG TAGS.

         Schaefer turns to Dillon.

         Ramirez.

                  Time to let 'ol 'painless'
                  out of the bag.

         Grimly, Blain RIPS apart the velcro closures of the
         CANVAS BUNDLE slung across his shoulder, REVEALING
         a truly awesome weapon, a SIX-BARRELED MINI-GUN adapted
         for field combat.

         Kneels at the side of the original trail examining the
         ground.  He rises, holding a spent CARTRIDGE.  Schaefer
         approaches, kneeling beside him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What happened here, Billy?

         Billy looks at him, puzzled.

                                 BILLY
                  Strange, Major.  There was a
                  firefight.  Shooting in all
                  directions.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I can't believe Jim Hopper
                  walked into an ambush.

                                 BILLY
                  I don't believe he did, Sir.
                  I couldn't find a single track.
                  Just doesn't make sense.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What about the rest of Hopper's
                  men?

         Billy shakes his head.

                         (uncomfortably)
                  No sign.  They never left here

                         (pause)
                  It's like they just disappeared.

         Schaefer ponders a moment.  Then, to Billy:

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Stick with the guerilla trail.

         Blain feeds the magazine of BELTED-SHELLS into the
         weapon, cocking it.  He looks up at Mac, his eyes
         cold, his face taut with anger.

                                 BLAIN
                  Payback time.

         Blain hefts the Mini-gun to his hip as Mac draws back
         slightly on the breech bolt of the M-60, letting it
         snap.

         They move on, Billy pausing to look at the jungle
         before disappearing into the foliage.

         carefully watching this exchange from high in the
         treetop canopy.  The Observer watches as Schaefer
         turns and leaves the clearing, cautiously moving
         into the jungle.



  30     EXT. JUNGLE HILLSIDE - DAY                            30

         Mac appears suddenly, materializing out of the
         undergrowth, pausing cautiously, his senses alert,
         intense, almost nervous.  He moves on, his huge body
         barely making a sound as he weaves through the heavy
         undergrowth.

         Dillon appears.  As he moves on, he crosses over a
         fallen TREE.  Stepping down, his foot breaks through
         a rotten portion, a CHUCK of the log breaking free
         and rolling down the hill.

         Dillon at once goes into a defensive position,
         listening.  The jungle is SILENT.  He stands and
         starts to move forward.  Suddenly Mac appears
         within inches of Dillon's face.  Mac's face is
         menacing, angry.

                         (hissing; barely
                         audible)

                  Got it?

         Dillon's eyes are wide and fixed, staring back in
         cold hatred at Mac, controlling his rage...he knows
         the rules.

         Not waiting for a response, Mac turns and vanished
         into the jungle.  Seething with anger Dillon
         focuses on a still moving LEAF and STEM, indicating
         Mac's exit point.  He moves on.

         Crouches under heavy foliage, waiting.  He is
         joined by Mac.  They glance briefly at each other,
         scanning in opposite directions for movement and
         sounds.  They speak in whispers.

                                 BLAIN
                  Say, Bull.  What's goin' down?
                  We got movement?

                                 MAC
                  No.  Shithead with his
                  trenchcoat and dee-coda-da
                  ring was makin' enough noise
                  to get us all waxed.  I don't
                  like that guy.  Don't like
                  him at my back.  I ain't
                  winding up like those
                  bastards back there.

         Mac, sweating heavily, wipes the moisture from
         his brow with his finger.

         Blain pats the mini-gun affectionately.

                                 BLAIN
                  I know what you mean, Bull,
                  but don't sweat it, me and

         They do a gentle fist dap and smile warmly at
         each other.  Two men who have seen it all,
         through a dozen no-win situations, and have lived
         to tell about it.

         Mac advances a few meters and signals slowly.



  32     EXT. KNOLL                                            32

         The assault team moving up the hill, barely
         visible in the heavy foliage, the team moves
         cautiously into defensive positions.  Holding.
         A moment later they continue up the hill,
         crawling.

         On their stomachs, Schaefer and Ramirez clear
         the edge of the knoll, SEEING below a GUERRILLA
         VILLAGE, a huge, spreading PALAPA covering
         implacements dug into a hillside, descending
         to a winding stream bed below.  30 MEN, dressed
         in a mixture of jungle fatigues and civilian
         clothes, armed with AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES move
         about the camp.  A heavy MACHINE GUN emplacement
         guards the entrance to the camp.  TWO MEN sit
         in the camouflaged emplacement.



  33     SCHAEFER                                              33

         sweeping the camp with BINOCULARS, SEES a
         GUARD above the camp.  One of the man picks up
         a hand-held ROCKET LAUNCHER, placing it beside
         a bandolier of ROCKETS and a RADIO SET and
         CONSULS taken from the U.S. surveillance
         helicopter as if preparing to take them away.

         Schaefer puts down the glasses, looking at
         Ramirez who nods in acknowledgment.  A sudden
         MUFFLED CRY brings Schaefer's attention to one
         end of the camp, where a heavily thatched DOOR
         covers and opening to the PALAPA.  A GUARD
         stands at the door.

         The door flies open as a HOSTAGE, shirtless,
         hands tied behind his back, staggers through
         the door as if kicked from behind.

         The man falls to the ground, feebly trying to regain
         his footing.  Although difficult to see from Schaefer's
         vantage point, the man's battered face and welt-covered
         back indicate he has been severely tortured.

         Emerging from the palapa, a GUERRILLA LEADER,
         moustached and wearing a SIDEARM, approaches the
         beaten man, kicking him viciously in the stomach,
         rolling him to his side.

         Kneeling beside the man he withdraws an AUTOMATIC from
         his holster and cocks the hammer.  Grabbing the man by
         the hair he jams the muzzle into the man's ear and with
         a violent twist, pulls the trigger.

         The guerrilla leader stands and strides quickly back
         to the palapa, still holding the pistol, closing the
         door behind him.



   34    SCHAEFER                                              34 

         grim-faced at having witnesses the murder, lowers him
         glasses, a look of cold determination on his face.
         Quickly he and Ramirez ease down the escarpment,
         joining the other team members.

         Schaefer makes a circling motion with his thumb
         and the team members gather in close, huddle formation.

                                 SCHAEFER

         Crawl silently through the underbrush.  With nearly
         impreceptible movements, Blain slips out of the
         cartridge pack, ditching the Mini-gun.  He withdraws
         his COMBAT KNIFE, placing it between his teeth.

         They move through the underbrush in tandem, like
         two bug cats, stalking.  Mac freezes, the sweat
         pouring from his face, holds up his hand as Blain
         stops.

         Using a BLADE OF GRASS, Mac points out a metal TRIP
         WIRE, following it to a hidden CLAYMORE MINE.  Blain
         grins making a switching GESTURE.  Carefully Mac
         detaches the LEAD WIRES.  Directing the mine towards
         the camp, he reattaches the wires, nodding at Blain.

         SEEN THROUGH HEAT-SEEKING VISION, FOCUSED ON Blain
         and Mac, lying in the grass below, their bodies
         outlined in LUMONOUS AUREOLES.  The Observer SEES the
         NETWORK of TRIP WIRES guarding the approaches to the
         machine gun nests.  The wires GLOW as if ELECTRIFIED,
         standing out in hard-edged relief in contrast to
         the jungle foliage.  He moves higher into the forest
         canopy.

         On Schaefer's signal rises up, pulling a SENTRY to
         him, covering his mouth with his hand, jerking him
         backwards and to the side, knocking him off balance
         with a sweeping motion of his left leg, killing him
         with his COMBAT KNIFE.

         Belly crawls silently through the tall grass just
         outside and above the main entrance to the camp.  He
         stops, studying the ancient, rusted skeleton of a
         TRUCK parked on a level spot above the camp, its
         engine quietly IDLING.  The truck is jacked and
         blocked up, one rear wheel attached to a belt-drive
         leading to a PUMP, drawing water from a river nearby.
         In the open cab of the truck a GUARD is on duty,
         watching the high ground above the camp.

         Schaefer moves out, heading for the guard.



  39     EXT. MACHINE GUN EMPLACEMENT - DAY                    39

         While one Guerrilla attends to his equipment, the
         OTHER attentively watches the approaches to the camp.
         He is momentarily distracted by a BUZZING FLY, which
         he annoyingly swats at with his hand.

         He hears something to his side.  Turning to investigate,
         the huge, hamhock fist of Mack smashes into his throat.

         Simultaneously, Blain rises up behind the other man,
         grabs him by the hair, pulling him down, his COMBAT
         KNIFE driving downward.

         A SATCHEL CHARGE is looped over the gearshift lever,
         resting on the floorboard.  Schaefer, lying low
         across the seat of the truck, turns and looks, SEEING
         the guard, lying in a heap in the foliage.

         Moves into position to the side and above the camp.
         He carefully checks the readiness of his SIX-SHOT
         GRENADE LAUNCHER, also setting his MP-5 in front of
         him, ready for action.

         Crouched to the side of the truck, watches the camp,
         SEEING below through the dense undergrowth, Ramirez,
         barely visible, signaling.

         Before him are two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES.  He looks
         at his watch, and then up the hill to:



  41-A   DILLON AND HAWKINS                                    41-A  *

         their weapons ready.  Dillon picks up his binoculars,
         focusing on the machine gun emplacement, seeing a MAN,
         his face covered by a HAT.  The head rises, REVEALING
         the face of Blain, who looks above the camp and
         slightly nods.  Putting his glasses down, motions
         to Hawkins.

         Holds his huge, COMMANDO MACHETE on a diagonal,
         pushing through the belt, slicing it cleanly.  Turning
         he crawls silently to the rear of the truck,
         positioning himself behind the rear of the one ton
         truck.

         He squats, and with an enormous, concentrated effort,
         deadlifts the rear of the truck, its rusted springs
         and frame beginning to CREAK and GROAN slightly.

         With a herculean effort he lifts the truck free of
         its blocks and then pushes forward.  He rolls aside,
         disappearing into the ground cover as the truck, its
         tireless rims digging into the earth, lops down the
         hill, slowly picking up speed.



  45     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE - DAY                          45

         A Guerrilla, alerted by the SOUND of the approaching
         truck, looks up at the hillside, SEEING the vehicle
         still moving down the hill at a moderate roll.  He
         CALLS OUT and several Guerrilla leaves their posts,
         moving out to prepare to stop the truck.

         The truck rolls into the clearing picking up speed,
         heading towards the main palapa.  The men rush
         forward, surrounding the truck, trying to slow it
         down, but the truck rolls, SMASHING through the front
         wall of the palapa.  The men gather around truck
         and then look back up the hill.



  46     EXT. ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                             46    *

         Watching as Schaefer pulls the pin and launches the
         GRENADE into the air, the Observer following its
         arc as it spirals dead-center into the camp, bouncing
         twice before rolling into the FUEL DUMP...which a
         moment later, EXPLODES into an incredible FIREBALL.

         The expanding FIREBALL released from the explosion
         is to the Observer like an erupting sun, momentarily
         blinding him.



  47     EXT. GUERRILLA CAMP - DAY                             47

         The truck is BLOWN up into the air by the explosion...
         a moment later the satchel charge DETONATES with an
         ear-splitting EXPLOSION, tearing the truck apart.



  48     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   48

         Jumps to his feet, FIRING an M-203 round into the
         camp.



  49     EXT. KNOLL - DAY                                      49

         Schaefer races down the hillside, joined by Dillon,
         leaving Hawkins to cover them.  Bullets burst around
         their feet as they run low, firing short bursts to
         his left and right.

         He FIRES the undermounted GRENADE LAUNCHER, sending a
         round into a gun position in the trees.  Still running
         he breaks open the breach, slamming in another 40mm
         ROUND from the cartridge pack at his waist.

         Blain and Mac fire the heavy machine guns, laying down
         a withering curtain of lead, shredding the camp,
         taking out five Guerrillas at once.



  50     EXT. GUERRILLA CAMP - DAY                             50

         A MAN almost completely ON FIRE is hit by an onslaught
         of GUNFIRE, ripping him back into the jungle.

         Ramirez cuts loose a barrage from the SIX-SHOOTER...
         seconds later the MACHINE GUN IMPLACEMENT erupts in
         a series of EXPLOSIONS, blowing two Guerrillas into
         the air.

         At the HILLSIDE HUT, two Guerrillas move into position
         by the window, drawing down on Schaefer as he appears,
         racing down the hill.

         As they are about to open fire, Dillon appears,
         YELLING OUT a warning.

                                 DILLON
                  On your nine!!!

         Schaefer dives, hitting the ground as Dillon OPENS
         FIRE taking out the Guerrillas.  Schaefer rolls to
         his feet, spins, firing the 203 grenade launcher,
         completely destroying the hut.



  51     EXT. ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                             51

         As the Observer regains its vision an eerie, surreal
         experience of sight and sound unfolds:

         BULLETS streak through the air, leaving blood-red
         trails of HEAT, like laser blasts.  As they impact
         into the Guerillas, we HEAR the enhanced SLAPPING
         of BULLETS, SEEING tiny blossoms of HEAT mushroom
         out of their bodies.

         We HEAR the horrific, deformed CRIES and SCREAMS
         of the dying men.

         Another searing, blinding EXPLOSION sends pieces of
         SHRAPNEL ripping through the air, some of them
         ROARING past the Observer's position, like tiny
         meteors.

  52     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE                                52    *

         at the entrance way to the main palapa, a Guerrilla
         stands in the doorway, giving COVER FIRE to his comrades
         as they fall back inside.

         Jumping from the roof of the adjoining palapa, Billy
         drops directly in front of the Guerrilla.

         From the side, unseen by Billy, another Guerrilla           *
         thrusts out with a knife, Billy ducking backwards, the
         tip of the knife SLASHING his face.  With a lightning
         move, Billy whips his arm up and around the Guerrilla,
         locking his elbow, breaking the joint.

         Still holding the man he FIRES, blowing the other
         Guerrilla off his feet with the SHOTGUN portion of his
         weapon.  He looks at the Guerrilla out of the corner of
         his eye.  He suddenly strikes, breaking his neck,
         dropping him in a heap.

         Billy continues on, racing down the stairs, firing the
         M-203.

         Meanwhile, Blain is crouched next to a tree, providing      *
         cover.  Behind Blain, at the edge of the camp, circling
         around from below, TWO GUERRILLAS appear and FIRE a
         grenade round which EXPLODES behind Blain, fragments
         ripping into the tree next to which Blain is standing,
         bark and dirt flying as shrapnel rips into his vest, one
         piece tearing into his upper shoulder.  The hits have
         no effect on the huge man and with a savage GROWL, he
         spins, opening fire, raking the two attackers with the
         Mini-gun.

         Nearby, Mac charges from the jungle on a dead run,
         diving over a fallen tree as machine gun FIRE rakes the
         ground around him.

         Blain, spotting the sniper high in a tree, opens FIRE
         with the MINI-GUN, shredding the tree, sending the
         Guerrilla crashing down through the roof of the
         palapa.



  53     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                     53

         The sniper CRASHES through the roof, landing on the
         floor near Hawkins and Ramirez who do a quick double
         take before opening fire on a group of fleeing
         Guerrillas, taking out two, giving chase to the others.

  53     CONTINUED:                                            53

         Schaefer and Dillon appear at the top of the staircase,     *   
         Schaefer freezing as he SEES below a Guerrilla raising
         an AK-47, preparing to fire.  Schaefer tackles Dillon,
         the two men hurling into the air, a moment later BULLETS
         ripping into the CRATES behind where they were standing.

         Dillon rises up, kicking over a crate, shooting the         *
         Guerrilla who is trying to bring the gun around to fire
         at him.

         Schaefer crouches, covering the upper entrances to the      *   
         palapa, as Ramirez rushes past, joining Schaefer.  From
         the corner of his eye, Schaefer catches a movement.
         With a whipping, backhanded throw, he lets fly his
         COMMANDO MACHETE...

         The machete impales the attacking Guerrilla, driving him    *   
         backwards, pinning him to a post.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Stick around.

         Schaefer and Ramirez run towards the lower levels, side
         by side, firing as they go.

         They reach a door, Schaefer taking out an ATTACKING
         Guerrilla.  Ramirez grabs the side of the door, shoots
         a look to Schaefer and throws it open.  With Schaefer
         covering him, Ramirez takes a quick peak inside and
         then rushes into the room.

         

  53-A   INT. ROOM - DAY                                       53-A

         At one end is a STAIRWAY, leading to an escape door.
         A Guerrilla, seen from the waist up, scrambles down
         the stairs.

         At the base of the stairs, a Guerrilla, holding an
         AK-47 on his hip, turns and starts to fire.

         Schaefer and Ramirez respond with full AUTO BURSTS
         which rip into the Guerrilla, spinning him around,
         knocking over a crude WOODEN TABLE, scattering a
         BRIEFCASE with burning PAPERS, FOOD CANS, and LIQUOR
         BOTTLES.

         As he spins he FIRES the weapon, an arcing line of SLUGS
         slamming into the tin roof, sending down a shower of
         rust and dirt.  He falls to the ground.  Dead.

  53-A   CONTINUED:                                            53-A

         Ramirez charges through the DUST and thick SMOKE to
         cover the fallen men; Schaefer following close behind,
         jerking a new CLIP from his ammo belt.

         Suddenly, another Guerrilla erupts from behind some
         ammunition crates, drawing down on Ramirez with a
         machine pistol.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (shouting)
                  Down!!!

         As the Guerrilla fires, Schaefer smashes the butt of
         his empty weapon into the Guerrilla's shoulder, knocking
         the gun aside, the SLUGS thudding into the wall
         harmlessly.

         He hits the Guerrilla with a vicious glancing blow to
         the head with the barrel of his weapon.  The Guerrilla
         is hurled backward, crashing into the wooden crates and
         to the floor.

         Ramirez, recovering quickly, descends the stairs with
         catlike agility, disappearing.

         Schaefer crouches and spins, jamming a new clip into the
         rifle, scanning the palapa for any other movement.  He
         races to the main door of the room, shouting into the
         palapa.

         He SEES Blain charging down the steps.  Catching his
         attention he signals him on, out the back to cover
         Ramirez.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Hawkins)

                  hook!  Position and situation,
                  now!

         As Blain runs down the stairs, Hawkins already has the
         radio off his back, setting up the portable SATELLITE
         DISH ANTENNA.

                                 HAWKINS
                  You got it, Major!

         Ramirez, Blain and Billy race down the back stairs
         of the palapa, FIRING Mini-gun, automatic and grenade
         rounds at the escaping GUERRILLAS as they flee the area,
         splashing, charging across the shallow river.

         The guerrillas are history...in no uncertain terms.



  53-C   INT. PALAPA - DAY                                     53-C

         For the first time, Schaefer studies the interior of
         the cavernous palapa, SEEING the enormous stockpile
         of WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT and SUPPLIES stacked along the
         walls, obviously a major military stronghold hidden
         deep within the mountains.  Mac hustles up to Schaefer,
         a look of urgency on his face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Any sign of the hostages?

                  And the gear from the chopper.

                         (pause)
                  Another thing, Major, we were
                  lucky...couple of those guys
                  we waxed are Russians,
                  military advisors by the look
                  of it.  Something big was
                  about to happen here.

         Schaefer looks at Mac a moment, a flush of anger
         beginning to show.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Good work, Mac.  Clear the
                  area, no traces.  Get the men
                  ready to move.

         Schaefer goes back into the room, looking down at the
         unconscious guerrilla, racking a round into the
         chamber, reloading his weapon.

         He kneels, staring into the FACE of a WOMAN, ANNA,
         dark, late twenties.  Despite her blood and
         dirt-smeared face, she is beautiful.

                  Shit...

         He checks her pulse and then slowly he bends to pick
         up her PISTOL, ejecting the clip.  He stands, beginning
         to shuffle through the PAPERS scattered about the room.
         Staring at one he looks up, the pieces falling together.



  54     EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                     54

         Ramirez, at a crouch, runs through the jungle,
         following the obvious signs of the Guerrilla's
         retreat.  He emerges from the trees into an opening,
         leading to a sheer rock cliff, towering fifty feet
         above the ground.  Scanning the wall, he SEES
         movement and quickly takes cover, as automatic
         FIRE rips up the ground before him.



  54-A   EXT. ROCK WALL - DAY                                  54-A

         Near the center of which a narrow cut, two feet
         wide, leads to the top of the cliff, giving access
         to the adjoining ridge.

         Two Guerrillas scramble up through the chimney,
         assisted by a ROPE, which with withdraw as they
         reach the top.  Ramirez takes out one man, the
         other taking cover, returning fire.



  54-B   EXT. BASE OF ROCK WALL - DAY                          54-B  *

         Blain joins Ramirez, behind cover at the foot of
         the cliff.  As they take cover, Ramirez notices
         the wound on Blain's shoulder.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  You're hit.  You're bleedin',
                  man.

         Blain looks briefly at the wound.

                                 BLAIN
                         (spits)
                  Ain't got time to bleed.

         On a signal, they both clear cover and fire LONG
         BURSTS from their weapons up the cliff.

         The smoke is hardly cleared when they are answered
         by withering FIRE.  They duck down as a grenade
         EXPLODES nearby.  Ramirez quickly replaces the 40MM
         rounds into the SIX-SHOOTER.

                  Hell, dude, we don't have all
                  day.

         Ramirez immediately rolls into the line of fire,
         BLASTING six RAPID-FIRE shots on a HIGH-ARC trajectory
         towards the rocks.  Blain reacts.

                                 BLAIN
                  Shit, Pancho!!!

         Blain dives against the protective cover of the
         rock wall, covering his head.  Ramirez casually
         hops across, squatting next to Blain.  They make
         eye-contact.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  What's your problem, dude?

         Before Blain can answer, Ramirez puts his fingers
         into his ears and grimaces just as...

         The entire hillside EXPLODES, blowing the Guerrillas
         into the air, a torrent of vegetation and earth
         raining down the cliff, obscuring Blain and Ramirez.



  55     INT. PALAPA ROOM - DAY                                55

         Schaefer is staring out the window, his weapon slack
         in one arm, still holding the paper.  Dillon enters,
         obviously excited about what he has found.  He sees
         the papers on the floor.  He reads through them
         quickly, growing even more excited.

                                 DILLON
                  This is beautiful!  More than

         Schaefer turns, striding slowly to Dillon, handing him
         the paper he is holding.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I think this is the one you want.

         Dillon reads it.

                                 DILLON
                         (reacting)
                  Two days...that's all we had.
                  In two days, three hundred of
                  these bastards would have been
                  equipped with all this.  After
                  they crossed the border, it
                  would have taken a year to
                  stop them.
                         (looks up)
                  We've averted a major
                  guerrilla invasion, Dutch...

         Schaefer moves in close to Dillon, face to face,
         anger flaring in his eyes.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (slow; deliberate)
                  It was all bullshit.  All of it.

                  got us in here to do your
                  dirty work.

                  I had to.

                                 SCHAEFER

                  Because I told you, you're the

                  I couldn't get you in here without
                  a cover story.

                  all expendable assets, can't you
                  see that?

         Schaefer takes the paper from Dillon's hands.

                  That's your problem, Dillon.
                  You always did put ambition
                  before the lives of your men.

         pocket.

         Anna, regaining consciousness, GROANS, a heavy flow
         of blood running down her face from her head wound.

         Hawkins appears at the door.

         Schaefer turns away from Dillon and steps through
         the doorway into the palapa as Anna moans again,
         MUMBLING something in Spanish.  Dillon kneels,

                  She's too valuable.  She's

         Dillon grabs the handset from Hawkin's radio, shoving it
         at Schaefer.

         Schaefer and Billy are kneeling on the ground near the
         trailhead, studying a MAP.  In the b.g., the team, hidden,
         covers the hillside approaches to the camp, nervous and
         wary, weapons ready.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  This place is too hot for a pick-up.
                  They won't touch us until we're over
                  the border.  We can lift at LZ 49,

                  Except for this valley.

         Billy shakes his head, following the CONTOUR LINES of
         the rugged terrain.

                                 BILLY
                  Looks bad, Major.  It's gonna be

                         (points to map)
                  If we follow above the river and
                  then down, here, at this canyon,
                  we might find a way out.

         Schaefer turns to Ramirez, kneeling close by.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (decisively)
                  Not much choice.  Pancho, take
                  the lead.  Double time it.

         He turns and looks at Dillon, Anna as his side, her
         forehead bandaged, her hands bound in front of her.
         He turns back to the others.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Lock n' load, watch your ass.

         Blain moves out, swinging the Mini-gun in front of him
         as he goes.

         Spins, hurling a string of insults to Dillon in
         SPANISH.

                                 ANNA
                         (in Spanish)

         She spits at him, turning forward with a twist of
         her head.

         Dillon picks up his back, shouldering it.  As they
         move on, Mac calls out to him.

                                 MAC
                         (quietly)
                  Hey, Dillon, over here.

         Dillon doesn't respond.

                         (louder)
                  Dillon, over here.

         Dillon turns and approaches, warily, holding
         the girl.

                                 DILLON
                  Yeah, what is it, Sergeant?

         MAc unsheathes his knife.  He gives Dillon a cold
         look and turns him by the shoulders.  Crawling
         across the PACK on Dillon's back is a huge SCORPION.

         Mac skeweres the scorpion with the tip of his
         blade, holding it before the wincing Dillon.  Anna
         smirks, nodding to the writhing, stinging insect.

         Dillon looks at Mac.

                                 DILLON
                  Thanks.

                                 MAC
                         (coolly)
                  Anytime.

         Mac flings the scorpion to the ground, crushing it
         with his boot.  He looks up at Dillon, walks away.
         Dillon follows, pulling Anna behind him.

         Billy, guarding the rear, glances furtively around
         the clearing.  He moves a step forward and stops,
         freezing.

         Slowly he turns back, his eyes riveted upon the
         treeline above the camp.  His eyes strain, his
         senses registering a fear he cannot name or see.

         Something is out there, in the trees, waiting,
         watching.

         Billy turns and walks into the jungle, pausing
         one last time to look behind him before he too
         disappears from sight.

         The jungle GROWS SILENT.



  58     EXT. OBSERVER'S ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                  58

         LOOKING DOWN from his vantage point TO the treeline
         below, terraces like stepping stones, FOCUSING ON
         a TREE, fifty feet away.

         The Observer utters a LOW TRILL and springs outward
         into space, hurtling downward towards his landing
         point, the canopy of the trees approaching in a
         staccato rush of green.

         The SOUNDS of the FOREST are again altered and
         enhanced with an electric, STATIC-LIKE quality as
         the Observer descends fluidly through the trees
         and to the ground.

         He enters the camp, surveying the terrible
         destruction and carnage.  He SEES the dead
         Guerrillas, the dissipating heat from their bodies
         leaving them pale and GHOST-LIKE, as if fading
         light about to extinguish.  He sees their weapons,
         the cold hard steel of the barrels registering
         ICE BLUE in his vision.

  58-A   EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. OF HIS HAND - DAY              58-A

         As it appears, pulsing in a pale magenta heat, low
         to the ground, holding his weapon.  He lays down
         the weapon, picking up the SCORPION, turning it
         slowly in his fingers, examining it.  It looks like
         an exotic flower, its color fading from sight,
         turning to BLACK.

         A low SOUND is uttered, something vaguely familiar
         about it:  A NEARLY HUMAN VOICE, a distorted
         imitation of Mac.

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.; filtered)
                  Dillon, over here.

         Again the phrase is uttered, improving, closer to
         Mac's inflection and accent.

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.)
                  Dillon, over here.

         The Hunter lowers the pitch.

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.)
                  Dillon, over here.

         The last effort is a chilling simulation of Mac's
         voice.



  59     EXT. OBSERVER'S HAND - DAY                            59

         Drops the scorpion and picks up the weapon which
         changes instantly back to the Observer's skin tones.



  59-A   EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. - DAY                          59-A

         He turns and focuses on the area where the team
         left camp.

         He crouches and springs to the lower branches of a
         tree, grasping them with his clawed, three-fingered
         hands, pulling himself up and through the branches
         with astounding speed and simian-like dexterity; his
         spurred prehensile feet, grasping and thrusting him
         to a vantage point, fifty feet above the ground.

         As he moves on, the jungle grows suddenly QUIET, as
         if aware, sensing that the HUNTER is now stalking, no
         longer observing!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               43



  60     EXT. JUNGLE VALLEY - DAY                              60

         The twilight world of a PREHISTORIC FOREST, filled
         with gigantic plants and towering trees, overgrown
         with vines and creepers.

         The team, with Billy at point, walk alongside a
         wandering STREAM BED, weirdly illuminated by SHAFTS
         OF LIGHT, streaming through openings in the trees,
         as if from spotlights, a hundred feet above.

         It is midday, hot and humid, the air BUZZING with the
         sounds of insects, the CRYING of birds and monkeys.
         The men are moving fast and quiet, straining to see
         into the dense jungle, aware of every sound, sweating,
         quietly slapping at biting insects.



  61     EXT. GIANT HARDWOOD TREE - DAY                        61

         Lies across their path.  As the man climb over a
         rotten section, Mac stops to assist Blain with his
         Mini-gun.

                                 MAC
                  I've seen some badass bush
                  before, but nothin' like
                  this, man.
                         (pause)
                  Little taste 'o home?

         Blain nods and pauses to rest, looking around him
         as Mac withdraws a small silver POCKET FLASK.  He
         takes a nip, passing the flask to Blain who also
         takes a sip.

                                 BLAIN
                  I hear you bro, this is some
                  shit.  Makes Cambodia look
                  like Kansas.  Lose your way
                  in here, man, you be in some
                  kinda hurt.

         Blain hands back the flask, Mac replacing it inside
         his vest.  They do their hand dap, looking warily
         behind them before they move on.



  62     EXT. ANNA AND DILLON - JUNGLE - DAY                   62

         Have fallen behind, Dillon looking worriedly ahead
         at the them out distancing them.  Anna is keeping
         her pace purposefully slow.  She trips on a root
         falling to the ground.  She lies there, motionless.
         He quickly reaches down to haul her to her feet.

                                 DILLON
                         (urgently)
                  Shit.  Come on...

         Like an uncoiled spring, Anna turns, flinging a
         handful of DIRT into his face, momentarily blinding
         him.  She lunges for his rifle with her bound hands.

         Suddenly the BARREL of an MP-5 is thrust into her face.

         Looking up she SEES Ramirez, calmly holding the weapon
         on her, the look in his eyes indicating he'd hove no
         trouble shooting her.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (in Spanish)
                  Don't try it.

         She looks back at Dillon, wiping the dirt from his eyes.
         She moves on.  Ramirez gives him a cold look as Dillon
         hurries past.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (coolly)
                  You should put her on a leash,
                  Agent Man.  If you can't handle
                  her, just say the word.

         Dillon moves on, ignoring Ramirez, who turns, scanning
         the jungle behind him before moving on.  Dillon catches
         up with Anna, turning her sharply by the chin.

                                 DILLON
                         (cold; in Spanish)
                  Try that again.  Please.                           *

         She looks at him contemptuously, undaunted.  She will
         try it again.  She breaks away from his grasp and
         moves on, Dillon watching her go, he won't hesitate
         next time.



  63     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            63

         As he travels, directly overhead, timing his movement
         with those of the team.  He moves lower, closer to
         the slowly moving humans.



  64     EXT. RIVER BED - DAY                                  64

         The team moves cautiously through the winding stream
         bed, now wearing their clothing in various stages of
         disarray for comfort, sweat dripping from their bodies.

         Billy, in the lead, picks his way along the riverbank,
         his concentration rapt, aboriginal.  His face a
         trancelike mask of expectation.

         Blain, cradling the heavy Mini-gun as if it were a
         toy, swings the weapon relentlessly across his field
         of view.  He pauses to adjust the hanging, belted
         loop of cartridges trailing from the back pack
         magazine.  An INSECT lands on his face and is trapped
         in the grease paint near his lips.  He draws the
         hapless bug into his mouth with his tongue and quietly
         spits it out, his concentration unbroken.

         Mac follows, holding the M-60 high across his chest.

         Schaefer, bent, cautious, his feet moving aside the
         dry leaves on the ground, heel to toe and on foot
         edges.  He glances around, checking the team's
         position and progress.

         Hawkins follows, his mouth open, breathing deeply,
         exhausted, the radio a 60 pound demon.

         Anna, struggling to climb a section of the stream
         bank, slips on some loose dirt.  Unable to assist
         herself with her hands tied, she nearly falls.
         Dillon prods her with his rifle, forcing her to
         her feet.  She scrambles up the bank, Dillon following.



  65     EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY                                 65

         As Billy enters a small clearing, bordered on one
         side by the towering trees, carpeting the
         mountainside.  High above in the thick, impenetrable
         treeline, brightly colored birds SQUAWK loudly,
         chasing each other from branch to branch.

         Suddenly Billy stops.  Schaefer holds up his hand
         and the team freezes in position.  An eerie SILENCE,
         like a slowly falling curtain, descends over the
         jungle until even the BUZZING and CLICKING of insects
         have CEASED.



  66     EXT. TEAM MEMBERS - DAY                               66

         Sensing an ambush, move quietly into the foliage.
         Dillon moves into the undergrowth, dragging Anna
         with him.  He slings his MP-5 over his shoulder,
         withdrawing his KNIFE.  Grasping Anna by her shirt
         collar and pushing her to the ground he holds the
         weapon near her throat.  Dillon signals to Ramirez          *
         who approaches.  Dillon hands Ramirez the knife.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                  Watch her.

         Before Ramirez can respond, Dillon slips into the
         undergrowth.  Ramirez holds the knife on Anna,
         cautiously scanning around him for movement.

         Unseen by Ramirez, Anna's outstretched hands slowly
         tighten around a stout ROOT-BURL, lying loose on the
         ground.



  67     EXT. BILLY - AT THE RIVER BED - DAY                   67

         He remains frozen and transfixed, staring into the
         treeline.  Something is moving, fluid, silently and
         downward, into the forest.  Billy remains rooted to
         the spot, lost in concentration.



  68     SCHAEFER                                              68

         sensing something very wrong with Billy, moves alongside
         Mac.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What's got Billy so spooked?

                                 MAC
                  Can't say, Major...been

                  I think that nose of his is
                  too good...smells things that
                  ain't there.

         Schaefer signals for Mac to cover him and then moves low
         and quiet towards Billy.  Dillon appears, looking to
         Mac for an explanation.  Mac ignores him, concentrating
         on the jungle.  Dillon looks forward at...

         Billy, his eyes riveted to the capony above, as he
         unconsciously reaches to his throat, grasping a LEATHER
         POUCH, secured to his neck by a thong.  He fingers the
         MEDICINE BAG talisman.



  69     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            69

         As he slowly descends through the trees, moving
         towards Billy, who's eyes search the treeline for
         movement.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  70     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                                70

         approaches Billy, gripping his shoulders and in a
         hoarse whisper, speaks his name.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What is it...?

         Billy, rigid, does not respond.  Schaefer forcefully
         jerks his around to face him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Billy...What the hell's wrong

  71     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            71

         Still closing in on Billy.  Billy turns back, looking
         high into the trees, puzzled and frightened.  He's
         lost sense of the Hunter's presence.  He lowers his
         vision, looking towards the Hunter, now on the ground,
         30 yards across the clearing from Billy.  The Hunter
         pauses.



  72     BACK TO SCENE/BILLY AND SCHAEFER                      72

                  ...there?

         Schaefer stares hard at the jungle.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  It's...nothing...



  73     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            73

         Moves behind a broad fern, skirting around Billy
         and Schaefer, heading away from the column.



  74     BACK TO SCENE/BILLY AND SCHAEFER                      74

         Schaefer shakes his head, continuing to stare into
         the jungle.  He turns to Billy.

         in agreement.

         Sensing the danger has passed, Ramirez releases his
         grip on Anna.  As they start to rise, Ramirez sheaths
         his knife and unslings his MP-5.  Anna still stares
         hard into the jungle.

         Suddenly, without even looking, Anna with the trained
         reflexes of an experienced fighter swings the BURL with
         all her might, catching Ramirez hard on the side of the
         head, just above the eye, opening a wicked gash.
         Spinning around she knees him brutally in the groin.
         As Ramirez goes down, doubled over in pain, Anna turns,
         scrambling up the embankment, running for the jungle.

         Ramirez CRIES out.



  76     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   76

         HEARING Ramirez' cry, Schaefer signals to Hawkins to
         move.  Hawkins moves out, fast, heading towards the
         sound...



  77     EXT. HAWKINS - DAY                                    77

         SEES Anna running away.  He gives chase.
         Anna, although bound, is light and fit and runs fast,
         hurdling fallen logs and branches, charging through the
         undergrowth.  SHe has a good start.

         Hawkins, hampered by the radio and weapon but in
         tremendous shape, thunders after her, closing the
         distance.



  78     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            78

         As he passes from behind a large tree, surrounded by
         dense foliage, SEEING the fleeing Anna.  He watches
         her and then begins to move parallel with her, only
         faster, the green of the jungle rushing by in a blur.



  79     EXT. ANNA AND HAWKINS - DAY                           79

         Anna, bursting through a grove of ferns, drives on,
         breathing hard with the exertion.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

  79     CONTINUED:                                            79

         Hawkins, ten yards behind, closing the distance,
         taking advantage of any hesitation Anna makes,
         struggling with the dense jungle.

         Anna hits a small clearing, an alleyway through
         the trees.  She sprints hard across the clear
         ground.



  80     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            80

         Moving through the jungle.  As he steps clear of
         the foliage he SEES Anna driving hard into the
         alleyway, running directly towards him.  Twenty
         yards away, Hawkins, closes in.



  81     BACK TO SCENE/HAWKINS                                 81

         Only a few feet behind Anna, lunges forward, knocking
         her to the ground.  In a second he's on her, his
         weapon ready.  She struggles to her feet, fighting,
         gasping for breath.  Hawkins holds the MP-5 on her,
         looking at her, almost pleading.  He doesn't want
         to shoot her, but he will if he has to.

                                 HAWKINS
                  Please...

         She looks at the weapon, to Hawkins and then,
         hopefully, to the jungle.  She stops, staring hard
         down the alleyway.  Something...suddenly she sees it!


                                 ANNA
                         (in Spanish)
                  Look out, behind you!!!

         Hawkins spins...



  82     EXT. HAWKINS AND ANNA'S P.O.V. - DAY                  82

         SEEING the MOTTLED OUTLINE of the Hunter's body,
         racing towards them, as if the entire wall of the
         jungle were rushing in.  The Hunter's WEAPON
         flares to life.



  83     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - ANNA AND HAWKINS - DAY         83

         As he hurtles towards them, their faces frozen in
         surprise.



  84     BACK TO SCENE/ANNA AND HAWKINS                        84

         A splitting THUD as Hawkins is hurtled backwards into
         the undergrowth, the Hunter's hand and WEAPON flashing

         through the air.  BLOOD splashes on Anna's face.
         She SCREAMS as Hawkins' MP-5 FIRES a short BURST
         into the air.



  85     EXT. RIVER BED - DAY                                  85

         HEARING the GUNFIRE, Schaefer WHISTLES low and sharp.
         Ramirez, face bloody, swings into action, moving in a
         coordinated defensive/offensive pattern into the
         jungle.



  86     HAWKINS/BACK TO SCENE                                 86

         The Hunter's ARM and SPUR hook into Hawkins' leg, and
         he is dragged into the jungle.



  87     EXT. RAMIREZ - DAY                                    87

         Ramirez runs forward ten paces, drops to a crouch,
         scanning to each side.  Immediately Schaefer runs
         forward twenty paces.  As he passes Ramirez, Ramirez
         turns and scans the rear and flanks.

         Dillon, Mac and Blain repeat the maneuver, leap-frogging
         forward, canvassing the jungle, providing areas of
         intersection cover.



  88     EXT. RAMIREZ                                          88

         Entering the alleyway where Hawkins was killed he SEES
         Anna, cowering in the bushes, her blood splattered
         face glazed with terror, his eyes vacant.  He
         approaches, angry, wary, but the girl is so stunned.
         He SEES the trail of BLOOD and CRUSHED GRASSES leading
         into the jungle.  He gives a LOW WHISTLE and then moves
         on, the rest of the team assuming defensive positions
         around the clearing.

         He follows the trail, finding first Hawkins'
         blood-covered weapon, and then, a few yards later,
         the radio.  Ramirez cautiously parts the brush before
         him.  A look of puzzlement and then revulsion comes
         of his face.



  89     EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY                                   89

         Blain and Mac at either end, cautiously searching
         the jungle; Billy covering their flanks.

         Schaefer and Dillon approach Anna.  She seems unaware
         of their presence, staring numbly ahead.  Schaefer
         checks her out, looking for wounds, he wipes some of
         the blood from her face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  It's not her blood.

         Ramirez emerges from the jungle carrying Hawkins'
         MP-5 and radio.  He approaches, dumping the equipment
         on the ground.

                                 RAMIREZ                                    
                  Major, you'd better take a
                  look at this.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Hawkins?

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (oddly)
                  I can't tell.



  90     EXT. SCHAEFER AND RAMIREZ - DAY                       90

         Dillon in the b.g., as Ramirez parts the brush with
         his weapon.  Before them, covered with dirt and
         leaves, are Hawkins' ENTRAILS.  There is no body.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (shocked)
                  What in God's name...?

                                 RAMIREZ
                  I think it's Hawkins.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Where the hell is his body?

                                 RAMIREZ
                  There's no sign of it.



  91     EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY                                   91

         The entire team is gathered, still holding defensive
         positions.  Anna, still stunned, is beginning to
         come around.  She looks up at Schaefer.  He turns to
         Ramirez.

                  Ramirez, ask her what
                  happened.

         Ramirez drops to one knee and talks softly to her in
         SPANISH.  She mutters incoherently in Spanish, still
         dazed, shaking her head.  Dillon listens closely to her
         response.  Ramirez turns to Schaefer.  He seems
         confused.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  She says...the jungle came
                  alive, and took him...

                                 DILLON
                  That isn't what she said...
                  she said...
                         (pondering; to
                         Ramirez)
                  ...she doesn't make sense.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (growing angry)
                  Couple of sappers been
                  trailing us all the way from
                  the camp, Major.  Billy heard
                  them.  She set us up, ran
                  for it...They were waiting.
                  I should've wasted the bitch
                  when I had the chance.

         Schaefer, looking at Hawkins' bloodstained equipment
         lying at Anna's feet, looks up.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (quietly)
                  Why didn't they take the
                  radio and his weapon?
                         (pause)
                  Why didn't she escape?

         Ramirez and Dillon look at the equipment and then
         to the girl, still numb with shock.

                                 DILLON
                         (grimly; remembering)

         The two veteran commandos look at each other, finding
         no explanation between them.

                  pattern and double back.  Fifty
                  meters.

         They move out.  Schaefer moves into the jungle,
         searching.  He crouches at the base of a huge
         MAHOGANY TREE, covered with vines, studying the
         jungle.  He moves away from the tree and into the
         forest, looking for signs on the ground.

         Where he was sitting, a DROP OF BLOOD falls.  Another
         drop falls, dripping from a leaf and above that, from
         another leaf.  Above that, high in the top of the
         tree, SUSPENDED from vines from his ankles, is
         HAWKINS' BODY, his chest a gaping wound.

         He hands there as if he were an animal, field dressed.



  92     EXT. BLAIN - DAY                                      92

         Crouched in the undergrowth.  There is a movement in
         the brush before him.  He wipes the sweat from his
         eyes and clicks his safety on the Mini-gun to fire.

         The SOUND is growing closer.  Blain levels the weapon.
         A smile crosses his face.

                                 BLAIN

                  in.  'ol 'painless' is waitin'...

         The movement in the brush is GROWING LOUDER.  Blain's
         finger moves closer to the trigger.

         Suddenly a small TAPIR bursts through the leaves,
         startling Blain.  He relaxes momentarily as he
         watches the animal scurrying from sight.  He
         stands...

         SOMETHING grazes his shoulder, a gout of BLOOD erupting.
         He starts to turn, the Mini-gun held low, ready to
         fire...

         ...from out of the jungle, 75 feet away, the Hunter's
         WEAPON streaks toward him like a missile.  He SCREAMS
         as it enters his back, erupting from his chest in an
         EXPLOSION of BLOOD.

         Has heard Blain's cry.  He moves fast through the brush.
         He HEARS a RUSTLING in the bushes.  A wet SUCKING SOUND.
         Mac charges into the clearing.  In the instant before
         the Hunter disappears into the forest, Mac SEES a vision
         so brief and fantastic that it seems like a
         hallucination.

         The Hunter's EYES flare momentarily from the green
         before they vanish.

         Mac sees his friend, lying on the ground, his chest
         open, the powerful man, dead.

                                  MAC
                         (shouting)
                  Contact, 30 Right!!!

         He OPENS FIRE with his M-203, belted shells slamming
         into the weapon from the magazine at his waist,
         expending it in one LONG BURST.

         He throws down the weapon and with a cry of rage, lunges
         forward, grabbing the Mini-gun.  As he stands, the
         CARTRIDGE BELT, attached to Blain, strings out between
         them.

         He opens FIRE and the foliage before him EXPLODES with
         the fury of the terrible weapon.  Mac sweeps the
         Mini-gun from left to right, like a man possessed,
         mowing down the jungle.

         The other team members race INTO SIGHT and begin firing
         with Mac.

         Moving.  A piece of SHRAPNEL cuts his shoulder.  A
         splash of ORANGE BLOOD spatters across the LEAVES
         of a nearby tree, bullet holes ripping through the
         surrounding foliage.

         More FIRING.  Mac, his weapon expended, continues
         to thrust the Mini-gun forward, still squeezing the
         trigger.

         Suddenly, as quickly as it started, THE FIRING STOPS.
         The men move catlike into the jungle, reloading,
         searching, their nerves taut, stretched to the limit,
         ready to fire again at any second.

         Mac is frozen, eyes wide, unblinking, his breath
         coming in rapid gasps as he stares into the jungle,
         still squeezing the trigger of the weapon, its
         breech locked open, GUNSMOKE wafting from the chamber
         and barrel.

         Schaefer moves in front of Mac, still staring into the
         jungle.  Dillon pushes Anna into the clearing, moving
         towards the body.  Anna looks at the body and then up
         to Mac.  Schaefer sees a terrifying moment of
         recognition flash in her eyes as she continues to
         stare at Mac.  He turns to Mac.

                                 MAC
                         (confused)
                  I...saw it.

         At these words, Anna reacts in shock, drawing a             *
         slight breath.  Schaefer turns, sees her staring at         *
         Mac.  He turns back.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You saw what?

                                  MAC
                         (still dazed)
                  I saw it.

         Schaefer turns back to see Anna, staring fixidly at Mac,    *
         watching his lips.  Schaefer turns quickly to Blain's       *
         body and kneels alongside Dillon.

         mutilated body.  He is joined by Dillon.

                  cauterized...what the hell
                  did this?

         Schaefer stands, looking at the body.  In the b.g.
         Anna drifts away from the group.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Mac)
                  ...Mac!

         Mac stares ahead, dumbly, not hearing.  He grabs Mac
         by his shoulders, shaking him violently back to
         awareness.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (demanding;
                         angry)
                 Mac!  Mac!  Look at me!

         Mac turn to face Schaefer, a shocked expression on his
         face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (urgent)
                  Mac, who did this?

         Mac is suddenly angry and frustrated, he has no
         explanation.

                                 MAC
                  I don't know.  Goddamn it,
                  something...I saw something/.

         Ramirez runs from the jungle, breathing hard, shaking
         his head.

                  Nothing.  The same thing.

         Mac stands.  Instinctively the team has now grouped
         around Schaefer, their weapons pointing into the jungle,
         ready, their nerves on total edge.  Schaefer looks
         upward at the darkening sky.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (quietly)
                  We're losing the light.  Mac,
                  I want a defensive position
                  above this ridge, mined with
                  everything we're got.

         Man is again the hardened professional.

                                 MAC
                  Yessir.

         Schaefer looks down at Blain's body.  He turns to
         Ramirez and Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Put him in his poncho and
                  liner and carry him back.
                  We'll bury him in the morning.

                  I'll take him.

         as they leave approaches the brush, her attention
         focused on something clinging to the leaves, well off
         to the side of where Mac saw the Hunter.  She draws
         closer, reaching out, hesitant, as if drawn magnetically
         to the leaves.

         Clinging to the leaves, thick, viscous, pale-orange,
         almost like the sap of an exotic plant.  Her fingers
         hover above it, hesitantly, and then touch it.



 101     ANNA                                                 101

         examines the blood, transfixed.  Dillon appears at her
         shoulder, startling her.  He motions for her to return.
         She turns, wiping the blood onto her pants leg.



 102     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DUSK                               102

         The team is dug into the foxholes in a dense grove of
         trees, a solid wall to their backs.  The men are barely
         visible they blend in so well.

         Nearby, Mac is stringing a TRIP WIRE, low to the ground,
         covering it with leaves and grass.  He moves into camp
         and reports to Schaefer.

                                 MAC
                  We've got most of the flares,
                  frags. and two claymores just
                  outside.  Nothin's comin'
                  close to here without trippin'
                  on somethin'.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Thank you, Sergeant.

         Mac starts to go but Schaefer places his hand on his
         shoulder.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I'm sorry, Bull.  It's never

                  The best friend I ever had.

         Mac turns and walks through the camp, stopping beside
         a DARK OBJECT on the ground.  He kneels beside the
         PONCHO pulling back the zipper REVEALING Blain's face,
         looking peaceful in death, as if lying in state.

         Mac removes something from his pocket, holding it in
         his hand, studying it.



 103     DETAIL OF OBJECT IN MAC'S HAND                       103

         The small WHISKEY FLASH, the chrome rubbed away in
         places REVEALING the brass beneath and a MEDALLION
         depicting the 101 1ST AIRBORNE DIVISION.

         takes a tiny sip from the flask.  He replaces the cap
         and lifts the flap of Blain's shirt pocket, placing
         the flask inside.  He lingers on the face and then
         closes the zipper.

         is huddles into a foxhole, her hands still tied in front
         of her.  She looks down at her pants leg.  The Hunter's
         BLOODSTAIN glows with a faint luminosity.  She places
         her fingers near the stain.

         A momentary HUSH falls over the symphony of night
         sounds.  Anna and Billy turn towards the trees with a
         growing look of wariness.  The others, setting up the

         The Hunter's foot steps on the upper leg of the corpse,
         the PREHENSILE SPUR digging deep, pinioning the body
         to the ground.  The Hunter's HAND extends, his
         FINGERS puncturing the skin at the base of the spine,
         gripping the vertebrae.

         With otherworldly strength the arm pulls, the entire
         SPINAL COLUMN ripping free from the body, a sickly
         SNAPPING and POPPING of cartilage separating from bone
         and tissue.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (whispering;
                         imploring)
                  You know something Billy, what
                  is it?

         Billy turns, his face a mask of primal fear.  He moves
         close to Ramirez.

                                 BILLY
                  I'm scared.

         Ramirez is frightened by this.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (shaken)
                  Bullshit.  You ain't afraid
                  of no man.

         Billy looks deep into his eyes, chilling Ramirez to the
         bone, looking at his with eyes which have seen on an
         instinctual level what the others have so far only begun
         to sense.

                                 BILLY
                  There's something out there,
                  waiting for us...it ain't
                  no man.

         Billy turns away, moving a short distance away, taking
         up his position.  Dillon looks after him and then into
         the blackness of the jungle canopy.  Dillon speaks to
         Ramirez.

                                 DILLON
                  He's losing his cool.  There's
                  nothing out there but a couple
                  of men that we're going to
                  have to take down.

         Despite his words, there is an edge of doubt in his
         voice.  Schaefer returns.  He's overheard this exchange.
         He's holding the group of DOG TAGS taken from Davis' men.
         He holds them up for Dillon to see.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You still don't get it, do
                  you Dillon?  He took Davis...
                  and now he wants us.

 110     INT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           110 

         CLOSE ON an oval CHAMBER made of an otherworldly looking
         metal with a strange copperlike patina, its interior
         bathed in INTENSE BLUE LIGHT.  In the chamber is
         Hawkins' SKULL CAP and SPINAL COLUMN still attached.

         The light field suddenly changes as all connective
         tissue, flesh and blood and drawn away from the bony
         structures with incredible force, disintegrating as they
         rush toward the sides of the chamber.

         The light changes in frequency to a dull glow as the
         Hunter's hands remove the GLAZED, POLISHED trophy from
         the chamber.  He turns, carefully placing it upon a
         GLOWING SURFACE.  He touches the trophy gently, feeling
         its texture, as a man might touch the hide of a big cat.
         He pulls his hand away and instantly an opaque FORCE
         FIELD covers the trophies.



 111     EXT. MAC - NIGHT (LATER)                             111 

         Hunched down in a foxhole, the Mini-gun on a tripod
         before him.  It's nearly a FULL MOON, the jungle a
         montage of SHADOWS AND REFLECTIONS.  Mac stares into
         the night, his eyes always moving.

                                 MAC
                         (distant;
                         whispering)
                  It's the same kinda jungle,
                  Bro, same moon...
                  everything...
                         (pause)
                  ...a real number ten night.
                  Remember Bro?  Only you and
                  me, the only one's out of the
                  whole fuckin' platoon who made
                  it out.

         His eyes probe the darkness, remembering.

                                 MAC
                  ...we walked out on top of
                  'em.  Not a scratch, not a
                  fuckin' scratch.
                         (spits into
                         the night)
                  No fuckin' chili-choker got
                  to you, Bro...you were just
                  too good...

         He ponders this a moment.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 112     INT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           112

         A FORCE FIELD that permeates the jungle, becoming one
         with the trees and foliage.  The Hunter walks down a
         CORRIDOR of SOLID LIGHT, leading to an opening to the
         jungle.  As the Hunter reaches the doorway he changes
         from visible to invisible, moving on into the night.



 113     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT                              113

         The mist has thickened, the night alive with a million
         JUNGLE SOUNDS.  The team members sleep uneasily, if at
         all.

         Mac, although weary, stares hard into the night,
         waiting, each small sound a potential enemy.  A LULL
         spreads over the jungle, animals and insects QUIETING.
         Mac tightens his grip on the Mini-gun.

         Billy awakens, peering into the night.  Nothing.

         Suddenly, a metallic CLICK, a POP, the SOUND of a
         warning flare rocketing into the canopy.  A moment later
         a brilliant FLASH as the flare burns, illuminating the
         camp.

         An echoing eerie SCREAM fills the night as a DARK SHAPE
         in the mist rockets through the undergrowth towards Mac.

         Mac spins, hauling the heavy gun around, just as
         something crashes into his upper body, driving the huge
         man into the foxhole.

         A desperate battle for life ensues, illuminated with
         the strobing light of the descending flare.  Mac's
         enraged SHOUTS and ROARS mingled with horrific SCREAMS
         fill the night.

         Mac's razor-edged KNIFE slashes in the light; BLOOD
         spatters his face as he attacks fiercely.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 113     CONTINUED:                                           113 

         Schaefer and Ramirez rush at a crouching run towards
         the foxhole, their weapons ready.

         A tremendous climatic SCREAM from the foxhole AND THEN,
         SILENCE.  Schaefer and Ramirez approach, cautiously.
         Mac stands, his face and clothes drenched in blood,
         some of it his, his breath coming in rapid gasps.  He
         looks at Schaefer, whispering hoarsely.

                                 MAC
                  Got the motherfucker...

         As the flare breaks through the canopy, dying out in
         great flickering bursts, the man stare down into the
         foxhole.  A huge, jungle BOAR lies mutilated in a pool
         of blood, still quivering in the final throes of death.

         The flare dies out.

         Mac, shaking from adrenalin, breathing heavily, looks
         down at the dying animal.

                                 MAC
                         (incredulous)
                  A pig...just a fucking pig...

         Schaefer shines his TEKNA-LIGHT onto the boar, playing
         the light along its massive hulk, its razor edges tusks
         gleaming in the light.  Ramirez appears by his side,
         looking down at the huge carcass.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Holy shit, Mac.

         Nearby, unnoticed by the men, Anna stoops, her hands
         still bound, picking up an MP-5 from the ground.  She
         turns, looking for an avenue of escape, running for
         the jungle.

         But the forest looks foreboding and sinister.  She
         stops, staring at the jungle, the moonlight reflected
         off leaves like a thousand eyes.  For a brief second
         she imagines she can see the Hunter's eyes, crashing
         towards her, the shifting patterns of light and dark
         making the jungle seem to strobe, like it is about to
         rush in at her.  She freezes, paralyzed by fear, by her
         memories of the attack.

         She drops the MP-5 to the ground.

         Back at the foxhole, Schaefer and Ramirez help the
         still shaken Mac from the hole.  Schaefer looks at
         Mac, at the huge gash across his chest.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 113     CONTINUED:  (2)                                      113

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Get a field dressing on that
                  right away.

         Suddenly he remembers, Anna.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Where's the girl?

         They all turn, ready to move and then stop.  Coming
         forth from the shadows Anna appears, still frightened,
         seeking the security of the soldiers.

         From the darkness nearby, Billy's VOICE in a hoarse
         WHISPER.

                                 BILLY
                         (o.s.; urgently)
                  Major, over here.

         Schaefer turns, apprehensive, something in Billy's
         voice...

         He walks over to Billy, standing with a FLASHLIGHT
         pointing to the ground.  They see Blain's BODY BAG
         slashed open, covered in blood.  Ramirez appears.

                                 BILLY
                  The body...it's gone.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Came in through the trip
                  wires, took it right out from
                  under our noses...

         Anna appears between Schaefer and Ramirez, staring down
         at the empty, blood-soaked body bag.  She looks up, into
         Schaefer's eyes.



 114     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY (PRE-DAWN)                      114

         A patchy GROUND FOG covers the area.  Anna, in her
         foxhole, awakens, LISTENING to the rising SOUNDS of
         the jungle.  MONKEYS begin to forage, their noisy
         CHATTERING and SCREECHING filling the air.

         A BIRD flutters back to its nest; a CHAMELEON emerges
         onto a leaf, directly above Anna's head.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

         Anna carefully extends her arm, allowing the lizard
         to crawl onto her, watching, fascinated as it changes
         colors.  She carefully places the chameleon back on the
         leaf, which changes color again, becoming nearly
         invisible.

         Near the empty PONCHO, Schaefer, Billy and Ramirez
         are examining the ground and the trip wire to the
         flare.  Billy stands, turns to Schaefer.

                                 BILLY
                  Boar set off the trip flare,
                  Major.  No other tracks.

         Schaefer kneels and examines the thin, well hidden
         WIRE.  He stands, looking around the camp.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  How could anyone get through
                  this, carry Blain out, right                       *
                  under our noses without leavin'                    *
                  a trace?

                                 SCHAEFER
                  He knows our defenses.                             *
                                                                     *
                                 RAMIREZ
                  Why didn't he try to kill one
                  of us last night?

         Schaefer looks at him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  He came back for the body.
                         (pause)
                  He's killing us, one at a
                  time...

         Schaefer turns and looks at Billy, asking with his
         eyes for a viable explanation.

                                 BILLY
                  Like a Hunter.                                     *

         Schaefer stares at him, the words sinking in.  He           *
         looks up, reconstructing in his mind the possible           *
         events of last night, his eyes following the tree line,     *
         tracing the path of the intruder as he might have           *
         travelled through the trees and down to the ground.         *
         He looks up at Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  He uses the trees.                                 *

         Billy and Ramirez stare up at the trees, a wave of fear     *
         passing through them...from the trees.  Schaefer turns,     *
         moving to where Dillon is guarding Anna, sitting on the
         ground.  Reaching down, Schaefer pulls her firmly to her
         feet, looking at her intensely.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Yesterday.  What did you see?

         She stares back at him.

                  You're wastin' your time.

                  No more games.

         She looks at him a long moment, and then answers in
         English.

                                 ANNA
                  I don't know what it was.
                  It...

         Dillon does a double take.  Schaefer continues to look      *
         at Anna.  He wasn't surprised:  he knew it yesterday.       *

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Go on.

                  It changes colors, like the
                  chameleon.  It uses the jungle...

         Ignoring him, Schaefer takes her hands, drawing his
         COMMANDO KNIFE, looking squarely into her eyes.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What's you name?

         She looks back into his eyes.

         She touches her pant leg, the stain is faded but still
         there.  Schaefer turns to Dillon.

 115     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - MORNING (LATER)                    115 

         Anna at the base of the rocks scans the jungle with
         binoculars watching the tree line.  Mac moves past her,
         uncoiling a trip wire linking up four CLAYMORE mines
         hidden at various points with leaves and foliage.  In
         a tree at the edge of the clearing, Billy tosses an
         uncoiling roll of wire to Ramirez who attaches it to
         a GRENADE, wedged it the crouch of a tree.

         Wires attached to GRENADES and CLAYMORE MINES lead off
         through the underbrush and trees leaving a long, unmined
         corridor leading from the camp and into the jungle.


         At the corridor's end, where the rocks merge with
         the jungle, Schaefer hauls down on a HEAVY VINE,
         straining with every ounce of strength, his muscles
         bulging, while Dillon takes up the slack of the vine

         around the base of a tree.  The vine is attached to a
         forty foot SAPLING, arcing closer to the ground in a
         gigantic bow with every pull, CREAKING and GROANING
         with tension.  With a last mighty heave, Schaefer draws
         the tree almost within reach, gesturing to Dillon to        *
         tie it off, who does.                                       *

                  got the chance.

         Ignoring him, Schaefer rapidly drags into position a
         NET crudely woven of differing sizes of vines, their
         LEAVES still attached.  He carefully begins to cover
         the net with leaves and debris.  Dillon watches him
         in growing frustration as Schaefer moves quickly,
         picking up a FRAMEWORK of STICKS he has tied together,
         a TREADLE-SPRING TRIGGER.  He holds up the framework,
         hurriedly examining his work before placing it on
         the ground.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  He'll be looking for the trip wires.

         Schaefer turns, there is a touch of fear in Dillon's
         eyes.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You're catching on, Dillon.

         Schaefer returns to his work on the net and trigger.        *

 116     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY (LATER)                        116 

         Morning passes.  Fog lifts as the sun creeps into the jungle.
         Insects swarm and are fed upon by BIRDS and other predators.

         At the entranceway to the rock outcropping, the net and trigger
         are hidden beneath the leaves, the framework of the trigger
         bulging with tension from the straining vine attached to the
         bent tree.

         At the other end of the corridor, several meters above the
         jungle floor, Schaefer and his team, heavily camouflaged,
         nearly invisible, lie hidden, waiting.  The team members, as
         if hypnotized by the BUZZING din, stare into the jungle,
         fixated, alert.

         ANNA while waiting at the net:

                                  ANNA
                         (hushed)
                  When I was little we find a man --
                         (she struggles for
                         the words)
                  -- like a butcher.  The old ones in
                  the village cross themselves and
                  whisper crazy things.  'Demonio,
                  cazador de trofoes...Only the hottest
                  times of the hottest years...'  Crazy
                  things...This year is grows hot.  And
                  we begin finding our men.  We find
                  them sometimes without their skin.
                  Sometimes...much, much worse.  Cazador
                  de trofoes...means the demon who takes
                  trophies.

         SLOW RACK TO Schaefer's face.  Ashen.  HOLD.  Suddenly an
         EERIE SILENCE moves over the jungle:

         He whips his face forward.  The silence is SHATTERED by a
         bird flapping from the brush.

         Schaefer sits back and scratches his head, frustrated and a
         little chagrined.

         Schaefer glares at him.  Turns to go --

         He stands and begins to move low to the ground toward the
         waiting snare.

         Behind him, sighting down their well-hidden gun barrels, the
         others scan the jungle, alert for the slightest sound or
         movement, covering him.

         Schaefer reaches the trap, carefully skirting the trigger
         hidden beneath the leaves.  He reaches the end of the corridor,
         moving out into the jungle.  He moves further away from the
         others, the silence crushing down on him.  He stops and waits,
         sweat pouring down his face, his finger tightening on the
         trigger of his M-203, eyes scanning the jungle.

         He turns his back on the jungle, waiting.  Nothing.  He moves
         back towards the corridor, reaching the net, again waiting,
         listening, sensing.  Nothing.  He turns around, looking at the
         jungle one last time, his face measuring defeat and then, with
         carefully, measured strides, he walks back to the camp.

         Schaefer looks at Billy who shakes his head in puzzlement.
         Nearby, Dillon starts to rise.

         Suddenly, behind Schaefer at the end of the corridor,
         with a resounding SWISH and SNAP, the NET explodes off
         the floor of the jungle in a hail of leaves and sticks,
         rocketing upward into the treetops.

         Schaefer spins, the others leaping to their feet as
         they SEE the net as it tears into the treetops, a
         large struggling bulge trapped within as a long,
         unearthly TRILLING SCREAM ECHOES through the jungle.

         Schaefer and the others charge from the rocks towards
         the jungle and the bobbing net, their weapons ready.
         Anna remains behind, watching terrified from the rocks.

         They arrive under the net, raising their weapons to
         fire...but before they can fire the entire net
         EXPLODES into a flurry of leaves, twigs, vines, dirt
         and a FLASH of PULSATING CRIMSON.



 117     EXT. HUNTER'S HAND AND ARM - DAY                     117

         As the Hunter leaps from the net his WEAPON activates,
         his arm slashing out, severing a THICK LIMB of the
         spreading tree capony, entangled in vines.



 118     EXT. THE TEAM - DAY                                  118

         The limb CRASHES down from the trees, Schaefer, Dillon,
         Billy and Mac Diving for safety.  But Ramirez, following
         the Hunter's leap, SEES too late the pendular movement
         of the severed limb and is struck a THUDDING blow in
         the ribs, which lifts him off his feet, hurling him
         backwards like a rag doll, his shirt torn open,
         exposing a BLOODY WOUND.

         As Anna runs to Ramirez's side the others, still
         stunned, look upward, frozen in shock SEEING:  THE
         HUNTER, clinging to a side of a tree, flushed bright
         crimson.

         Dillis is dumbfounded, like the others, rooted to the
         ground staring upward.

                                 DILLON
                  What is God's name...?

         The Hunter utters an unearthly SNARL and HISS from his
         open mouth as an instant later his camouflage resumes
         and he vanishes from sight...a rapid, furtive movement
         through the trees.

         Mac OPENS FIRE with the M-60, the others joining in,
         shredding the foliage, but they know the creature is
         gone.

         With a SHOUT, Mac races into the jungle, in pursuit
         of the Hunter.

         Schaefer hurriedly ejects the spent clip from the M-203,
         slamming in a new one.  He shouts an order to Billy.

         tosses the weapon to Dillon, who grabs it with one
         hand.  They share a look, knowing this is farewell.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I'll see you there.

                                 DILLON
                  Right behind you.

         Hefting both weapons at the hip he runs into the jungle
         after Mac.  Schaefer watches him leave.  He breaks and
         goes to Ramirez, attended by Anna and Billy, who is now
         sitting up, holding his ribs and gasping for breath.

                                 BILLY
                  He's busted up, bad, Major.

                         (gasping)
                  I can make it, Major.

         Schaefer lifts him to his feet, supporting him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Come on, Poncho, we're getting
                  out of here.
                         (to Billy)
                  Billy, take the radio, leave
                  the rest.  Come on!

         Creeping low to the ground, his eyes searching through
         the trees.

                                 MAC

 120     EXT. DILLON - DAY                                    120

         Moving through the underbrush HEARS a slight RUSTLING
         in the foliage.  Mac?  He strains to locate the source
         of the movement.

         He HEARS A SOUND, too faint at first it identify.  He
         listens.  Silence.  He hears is again, the SOUND of
         a VOICE, barely audible.  A VERY QUIET WHISPER.

                         (o.s.)
                  Dillon, over here.

         Dillon locates the direction of the voice and moves
         towards it.

                                 VOICE
                         (o.s.; barely
                         audible)
                  Dillon, over here.

         Dillon moves a few feet into the undergrowth.  He
         carefully parts the thick leaves and vines and enters
         a tiny opening.  He looks around, seeing nothing.

                                 DILLON
                         (whispering)
                  Mac?

         Suddenly a HAND appears and covers Dillon's mouth.
         Dillon gasps as Mac pulls him down to where he is
         hiding.

                                 MAC
                         (whispering;

                  Out there.  Past the rocks...
                  can you see it?

         Something seems to MOVE in the direction Mac is pointing.

                                 DILLON
                         (whispering)

                  We're gonna take this thing.

         Dillon points to an OUTCROPPING OF ROCKS, covered with
         VINES.

                                 DILLON

                  We both got scores to settle.

         Dillon silently disappears into the jungle, Mac
         watching him go.

         Mac makes his way toward the rock outcropping, working
         his way between the rocks and the vines.  He takes up
         a position and scans the jungle before him.



 121     DILLON                                               121

         moving quietly, his face intense, determined.  He
         stops and listens.



 122     MAC/ROCK OUTCROPPING                                 122

         straining to hear VAGUE SOUNDS coming from the jungle.
         He reaches out and grabs a VINE and carefully pulls
         himself forward into a better position.



 123     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 123

         moving, searching.  He goes into a crouch.



 124     MAC/ROCK OUTCROPPING                                 124

         There is MOVEMENT in the undergrowth.  He begins to
         sweat.  He moves the safety to fire; reaches out and
         grabs another vine to pull himself forward.  Mac
         reacts in shock.

         The vine is alive!  Before he can move, the Hunter's
         HAND appears from the vines, grabbing Mac by the
         wrist.

         In the moment before he is killed, Mac turns and SEES
         the Hunter's glowing EYES.

         A FLASH as the Hunter's other hand, moves with
         blinding speed, Mac's face contorting in pain as the
         Hunter's razor-sharp SPUR rips deep into his throat.
         He falls forward into the leaves.



 125     DILLON                                               125

         He HEARS the faint disturbance in the leaves.  He
         pauses, turning in Mac's direction, listening.
         Hearing no further sound he relaxes, moving on.

         Anna in the lead, followed by Schaefer carrying Ramirez
         on his back.  Billy, carrying the RADIO is covering
         them from above, as they skitter and slide down the
         loose gravel of a rocky slope, leading to a river
         crossing.



 127     EXT. DILLON                                          127

         He stalks through a narrow corridor of tangled vines
         and moss, leading to the rock outcropping on the other
         side, his face alert, showing no signs of fear, his
         weapon ready.



 128     EXT. VINES AND MOSS - DETAIL - DAY                   128

         Through the thick tangle of undergrowth, there is
         MOVEMENT, a slight, undulating distortion, drifting
         through the hanging vegetation, as if cast by a
         passing shadow.



 129     DILLON                                               129

         Did he hear something?  He moves on.



 130     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           130

         Behind Dillon and to the side of the corridor.  The
         Hunter syncopates him movements precisely with those
         of Dillon.

         Dillon stops.  The Hunter freezes in position.



 131     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 131

         He does sense something behind him.  He crouches and
         spins, leveling the weapon.  The corridor behind him
         is empty, quiet and undisturbed.  He studies the trail
         intently.



 132     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           132

         Peering out through the vines.  Dillon is looking
         directly at him.  Dillon turns, moves on, as the
         Hunter resumes his stalk, timing his movements
         perfectly with those of Dillon.



 133     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 133

         as he approaches the rock outcropping.  He signals.
         Receiving no response he moves closer, turning
         cautiously to right and left.

                  Mac...Mac.

         He moves closer to the rocks, eyes probing.  Through a
         gap in the rocks he SEES Mac's face, staring up at him,
         eyes frozen wide in death.

         Dillon spins hard.  He stares at the solid wall of
         undergrowth.  He looks from one side of the corridor
         to the other.  Something it out there.  Where?

         Something in the vines has caught his attention.  He
         stares hard at a section of moss.



 134     EXT. MOSS - DETAIL - DAY                             134

         Suddenly the right combination of light and shadow
         prevail and Dillon SEES in an instant, the Hunter's
         EYES materialize and then disappear.



 135     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 135

         With a growl and exhalation of breath, charges,
         bringing the weapon to bear.  A short BURST OF GUNFIRE
         erupts from the barrel.



 136     EXT. THE HUNTER - DAY                                136

         In an indiscernible blue of camouflage releases his
         weapon.



 137     DILLON                                               137

         SCREAMS, his arm instantly severed halfway between
         his shoulder and elbow.  The weapon drops to the
         ground, the forearm still attached, still FIRING.

         With his left hand he FIRES the second weapon
         SHOUTING INSANELY as swings it towards the blurred
         image of his unseen attacker, hitting nothing.

         The Hunter reloads his WEAPON which turns INVISIBLE
         again.  Dillon continues to fire.  The Hunter's
         weapon appears from below, cutting into Dillon's
         unprotected abdomen, which, as if hit by a samurai
         sword, bursts open.  Dillon CRIES OUT as the huge man
         hits the ground.



 138     EXT. LOG CROSSING - DAY                              138

         spanning the narrow gorge, Schaefer and Anna with
         Ramirez between them, move onto the log, preparing
         to cross.  They stop, HEARING Dillon's GUNFIRE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Moving through the jungle with incredible speed,
         leaping, tearing from tree to tree, the jungle a rush
         of HEAT TRAILS as he charges on.



 140     EXT. LOG CROSSING - DAY                              140

         The jungle is still deathly SILENT.  Schaefer, Anna
         and Ramirez cross the log, moving onto the other side.
         Billy, still at the foot of the log, providing cover,
         turns to face the jungle.

         He lifts his head towards the trees, feeling the
         onrushing presence of the Hunter.  He shrugs off the
         radio letting it fall, smashing into the rocks
         below.

         He casts away his weapon.  Staring forward he reaches
         into his cargo pocket, withdrawing a small
         GREASE-PAINT TIN.  Covering his finger in BLACK
         PAINT he applies dark slashes under his eyes and
         again, vertically down his cheeks.  Taking another
         dap of paint he makes a SYMBOL on his bare skin, over
         his heart.

         He drops the tin, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE.  Holding
         the knife he grasps the MEDICINE BAG around his neck,
         yanking it free with a quick snap.  He wraps the
         leather thong around his hand and knife, binding the
         weapon and bag together.

         Staring outward, as if in a trance, he begins a low
         CHANT.

         On the other side, Schaefer carrying Ramirez on his
         back, laboring up the steep slope, nearing the top,
         turns and SEES Billy standing, waiting at the foot of
         the bridge.

                                 SCHAEFER

         But Billy stands at the foot of the bridge, knife
         raised, waiting, accepting his oncoming destiny.

         waiting at the top.

 145     EXT. RIDGETOP - DAY                                  145

         Over the top, in a low depression, Schaefer props
         Ramirez against some rocks, reaching for his weapon.
         They HEAR Billy's echoing SCREAM.  Instantly their
         weapons are raised, cocked and ready.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Get back, into the rocks!

         Schaefer sweeps Anna behind him as Ramirez struggles
         to his feet.  Together they back up, covering the
         ridgeline over which they've just come.

         Suddenly, from one side, near Ramirez, the Hunter
         bursts from the jungle, Ramirez, seeing the Hunter,
         spins raising his weapons to fire...

         Ramirez SEES the Hunter's onrushing face, still in
         camouflage, a montage of organic textures and colors,
         his yellow eyes burning.

         Whipping the MP-5 is the direction of the Hunter
         he is hurled backwards from the impact of the Hunter's
         weapon, his neck gushing BLOOD, the MP-5 flying
         through the air, landing in front of Anna.  She moves
         for the weapon...

         The Hunter, with unearthly speed, turns towards
         Anna, as Schaefer starts to spin, SEEING the Hunter
         about to strike as Anna dives for the weapon.
         Schaefer lunges kicking the MP-5 out of Anna's reach.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Anna)

         Schaefer spins and FIRES, bullets THUDDING into the
         ground, the barrel arcing towards the Hunter as Anna
         stumbles to her feet running into the jungle.

         In a blur the Hunter spins back, hurling his weapon at
         Schaefer which slices through the wooden stock of the
         rifle, SPARKS FLYING as it severs the trigger guard
         and steel breech.

         The M-203 flies out of Schaefer's hands as the Hunter's
         weapon cuts deeply into his left shoulder, laying open
         the flesh.

         The M-203 hits the ground, where it lies broken in half,
         useless.

         Schaefer hits the ground and is rolling, up and running
         for his life, the Hunter charging after him.



 146     SCHAEFER                                             146

         crashes headlong through the jungle.  He leaps a fallen
         log, stumbles, struggles to his feet, running on pure
         adrenalin, his shoulder pulsing blood, his eyes filled
         with terror.

         Behind him he can hear the Hunter in pursuit, closing.

         Schaefer spins to look behind him, a wild desperate
         look on his face; he turns back, ducks an overhanging
         limb and lunges on.



 147     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. OF SCHAEFER - DAY               147

         Closing rapidly...another few yard.



 148     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               148

         runs like a madman, the SOUND of the Hunter's FOOTSTEPS
         close behind.  He's losing ground.  He knows he's going
         to die.

         Schaefer SHOUTS.  Suddenly the ground before him
         COLLAPSES and he disappears from sight.



 149     EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY                               149

         In a shower of leaves, flailing arms and legs, Schaefer
         crashes through the trees at the canyon's edge, free
         falling into space.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 149     CONTINUED:                                           149 

         With a sickening IMPACT, he hits the branches of the
         first trees lining the canyon and falls, a hundred feet,
         through one canopy after another, desperately grabbing
         for limbs and branched to break his fall.

         He hits the bottom branches of the list line of trees,
         impacting crosschest on a large BRANCH, knocking his
         wind out.

         Semi-conscious, he hangs momentarily before he slides
         off, fingers digging into the bark, falling another ten
         feet into the swiftly moving river.



 150     EXT. RIVER - DAY                                     150 

         Weighted down by his boots and clothing, Schaefer
         struggles to stay afloat.  Gasping for air he ducks
         underwater, untying one of his boots.  He surfaces,
         fills his lungs and dives again, releasing the other
         boot.  He surfaces, strips off his shirt and pants and
         begins to swim towards shore, stroking with one arm.



 151     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           151 

         As he nears the edge of the precipice from which
         Schaefer has fallen.  The Hunter in close pursuit does
         not hesitate but LAUNCHES himself off the cliff in
         a spectacular LEAP, streaking downward towards the tops
         of the trees that grow out from the canyon wall.

         The Hunter tears through the canopy of the first tree,
         the branches and leaves rushing past in a KALEIDOSCOPIC
         BLUR.

         The Hunter bounds off of one branch after another,
         moving through the trees as an expert skier might
         negotiate a series of downhill gates.

         The Hunter leaps free of one tree, bounds across twenty
         feet of open space to a large branch of a huge tree,
         affording a good view of the river below.  From his
         vantage point, looking down at the windening, slowing
         expanse of river, Schaefer is nowhere to be seen.



 152     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  152

         He is swept into a still FASTER CURRENT and is carried
         helplessly downstream.  Boiling WHITEWATER appears.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 152     CONTINUED:                                           152

         Out of control he is swept through a series of rapids,
         pulling his further and further downstream until he is
         finally ducked into the undertow and hurled over the
         top of a six foot falls, driven deep underwater by the
         pounding force of the water.



 153     EXT. POOL AT BASE OF FALLS - DAY                     153

         There is no sign of Schaefer.  Precious seconds pass.
         Slowly, looking like a drowned rat, he surfaces, taking
         a feeble breath.  He is nearly finished, his energy
         sapped.  But the water is calm and a few strokes are
         enough to carry him near the shore.  His feet hit
         bottom.

         He tries to stand but pitches headfirst into the thick
         MUD SLURRY at the river bank.  With his last ounce of
         strength, he crawls, panting and gasping into a
         sheltered mud OVERHANG, collapsing beside the exposed
         ROOT-SYSTEM OF A DEAD TREE, his body completely covered
         in thick, gray MUD.

         Nearly unconscious, he raises his head and looks to the
         opposite side of the river, scanning the bank.  There is
         no sign of the Hunter.  He collapses in relief.  He's
         escaped.

         Suddenly, the Hunter impacts the water, throwing up a
         huge SPLASH.  He stands up in the waist deep water.  As
         the water streams off of his body, the chameleon effect
         rapidly changes, struggling to match the shifting color
         patterns of the shimmering water.

         His glaring yellow orbs stare directly at the spot where
         Schaefer lies helplessly trapped.

         The Hunter surges forward, relentlessly closing in on
         this prey.



 154     SCHAEFER                                             154 

         is frozen in terror, paralyzed with fear, his eyes
         locked ontothe incredible creature that is about to
         kill him.



 155     EXT. HUNTER - DAY                                    155

         Closing rapidly, another ten feet.  He leaves the water
         and walks through the mud, stopping, towering over
         Schaefer.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               85



 156     EXT. SCHAEFER'S P.O.V. - DAY                         156

         As the Hunter's feet surge though the mud and stop,
         three feet away.



 157     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  157

         Realizing his life is about to end, closes his eyes,
         awaiting the Hunter's killing blow.



 158     EXT. HUNTER'S EYES - DAY                             158

         The fierce yellow orbs look downward.



 159     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           159

         He's looking directly at Schaefer, EXCEPT HE CAN'T
         SEE HIM.

         He can clearly see the EXPOSED ROOT-SYSTEM, but because
         of the heavy mud blocking Schaefer's body heat, Schaefer
         registers in the Hunter's vision as merely an indistinct
         lump of clay, unrecognizable to the Hunter as a human
         being.

         He scans the bank, searching, looking for heat sources.

         Detecting none he moves on sounding a questioning TRILL
         several times.



 160     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               160

         disbelieving that he's still alive, opens one eye,
         SEEING the Hunter's feet move away, his prehensile
         spurs dragging in the mud.  He rounds a bend and
         disappears, heading for the undergrowth.

         Astonished, he tries to raise up on his hands but a
         sudden jabbing pain in his shoulder causes him to
         collapse, falling onto his side, unconscious in the
         mud.



 161     EXT. RIVER - DAY                                     161

         As a HUEY ATTACK HELICOPTER breaks over the top of the
         ridge, diving forward, moving down the canyon.  The
         chopper flares up into a holding pattern.

         In the open doorway, a SOLDIER searches the top of
         the canyon with binoculars.  Seeing no sign of life,
         the chopper flies on, disappearing down the canyon
         rim.



 162     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               162

         lies unconscious in the mud, the distant SOUND of the
         helicopter THRUMPING into the distance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               86



 163     EXT. ANNA - DAY                                      163

         She runs into a clearing, stopping momentarily, gasping
         for breath.  She is startled by a sudden movement
         behind her.  She spins, looking.  There is nothing
         there.  She runs on.



 164     EXT. THE CANYON - DAY (DUSK)                         164

         Schaefer GASPS as his eyes bolt open in fear.  As if
         the Hunter were still attacking, Schaefer rolls to his
         feet and runs, slogging through the THICK MUD, stumbling,
         lunging forward, gasping for breath.

         Schaefer spins and staggers backwards into a shallow
         POOL, scuttling, crablike into the chest deep water.
         Schaefer backs into the moss-covered wall by the
         waterfall, looking for movement, regaining his senses.

         As the water settles, he looks down, SEEING the image
         of himself, reflected in the pool; his hair and face
         covered in THICK CLAY.  He stares, mesmerized at the
         image.

         He lifts his arm from the water, his fingers wiping the
         MUD from his face, exposing a PATCH of SKIN.  He studies
         the mud in his hand and then looks at the image of
         himself in the water, SEEING the exposed skin.  HE
         stares at it, a wave of realization rushing through
         his mind.  He places the mud back on his face, again
         looking at his image.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You couldn't see me.

         He looks up, out into the failing light, at the treeline
         of the deepening forest, realizing that fate has given
         him a fighting chance.  Slowly a look of vengeance and
         hatred crosses over his face.



 165     EXT. CLAY BANK - NIGHT                               165

         Using his MACHETE he carves MAGNESIUM SHAVINGS from a
         fire block into a pile of KINDLING.  He removes a match
         from the hollow handle of the machete, also containing
         a coil of PIANO WIRE, GREEN TAPE and MEDICAL SUPPLIES.
         He lights the shavings which burn with a brilliant white
         light.  Schaefer shelters the fire with a banana leaf
         until the flame dies down.  He feeds the fire with more
         kindling, fanning it with a leaf.



 165-A   SCHAEFER - BOW AND ARROW MONTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)     166

         Holding a three foot section of FIRE-HARDENED sapling
         between his feet and shoulder, he scrapes the char
         from the seasoned wood with his machete.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 165-A   CONTINUED:                                           165-A 


         He bends the bow and attaches a long piece of PIANO
         WIRE to one end, carefully wrapping it for strength,
         using strips of green tape to cover the sides of the
         wire where the nock of the arrow will fit.

         He attaches split quilled FEATHERS with fishing line to
         an ARROW,  its tip fashioned into a series of barbs,
         rubbing them to a polished hardness against a smooth
         stone.  When finished he places the arrow on the ground
         next to three other identical arrows.


                                 SCHAEFER
                  One chance, that's all.



 166     EXT. CLAY BANK - NIGHT                               166 
 

         Schaefer is pounding a peeled root between two stones.
         He pauses to drool saliva into the pulpy mass.  He
         scrapes the milky substance onto a BANANA LEAF, mixing
         it with a sticky SAP, holding it over the coals until
         the mixture steams.

         Schaefer coats the arrow tips with the sticky poison,
         holding them over the coals until the sap bubbles and
         smokes.  He spins the arrows in his hands, blowing on
         the tips to cool and harden the mixture.

         Using the tip of his machete, he pries open the casing
         of one of the 40MM grenades, discarding the warhead.  He
         dumps the PROPELLANT POWDER from the shell onto a leaf,
         mixing that with a mound of MAGNESIUM SHAVINGS.

         He opens the narrow, tight roll of GAUZE taken from the
         first aid kit of the machete handle, fluffing it into a
         large, loose BUNDLE, the size of a baseball.  He pours
         the powder-mixture into the gauze, mixing it into the
         fabric.

         He transfers the ball of explosive ladened gauze to a
         pliable DRY LEAF, closing it into a bundle, binding it
         at the top with a long strand of jungle-grass.

         He twists the remaining gauze around a MATCH, leaving
         the head exposed, forming a self-striking FUSE.

         He coats the fuse with SAP and then thickly covers it
         with more powder from the 40MM grenade.  He pokes the
         fuse down into the leaf.  Taking a long strand of JUNGLE
         GRASS he makes a large loop, tying it onto the grenade,
         slipping the loop and grenade over his head.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 166     CONTINUED:                                           166 

         Finally, using several sections of BAMBOO of differing
         diameters, he fashions a crude, anti-personnel
         SPEAR-BOMB, a BANG-STICK like weapon, using the
         sharpened TONGUE from his belt buckle for a FIRING PIN
         and a 40MM GRENADE from his belt pouch as an explosive
         charge.



 167     EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - NIGHT                            167

         Schaefer appears, he has covered him entire body with a
         variety of CLAYS and OCHERS, creating a mottled, EARTHEN
         CAMOUFLAGE pattern.

         Holding his weapons in one hand, he moves up the canyon,
         ascending into a rising boulder field.



 167-A   EXT. BOULDER FIELD - NIGHT                           167-A

         Where the river flows into a series of falls and pools,
         surrounded by massive boulders and table top rocks,
         their crevices jammed with large amounts of DRIFTWOOD
         swept down at high water from the forests above.

         On a flattened section of rock, Schaefer drags a large
         section of BRANCHES INTO VIEW, adding it to a growing
         mound of FIREWOOD.  He kneels, tending to a pile of
         DRIES GRASS, LEAVES and other tinder.  Using the last of
         his precious matches, he sets fire to the tinder, gently
         coaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consumming FIRE,
         flames starting to lick upward through the dry wood.

         He stands, staring into the rapidly growing blaze.  He
         turns, facing the canyon rim, raising his weapons in one
         hand.  From the depths of his soul, a SOUND emerges;
         primitive and visceral, as if from an animal in pain.

         He throws back his head and SHOUTS.



 168     EXT. CANYON RIM - NIGHT                              168

         A hundred feet below, Schaefer stands in the boulder
         field, his mud coated body bathed in RED FIRELIGHT,
         looking like a fierce, primitive warrior; a timeless,
         prehistoric sight, his long and WAILING CRY, ECHOING
         endlessly through the canyon.



 169     EXT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           169

         Backlit by the LIGHT of the open door, the Hunter's
         head, in three-quarter profile, his eyes gleaming, rears
         INTO VIEW, looking up at the sky, HEARING Schaefer's cry.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 169     CONTINUED:                                           169 

         Responding with a low HISS, he turns back, raising in
         one hand his weapon, in the other a U-shaped SHARPENING
         DEVICE.  As he passes the weapon through the device, it
         FLASHES into life, a deep, HARMONIC HUM emitted as the
         blade grows with energy, growing hotter, hotter and
         HOTTER with each stroke.  He draws the blade now WHITE-HOT
         through the device for the last stroke.  He lifts
         it, testing its balance, the WHITE-HOT blade
         illuminating his alien face.



 170-                                                 OUT     170-

 178     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - JUNGLE - NIGHT                178 

         Emerging from his camp, the Hunter swings into the
         nearby tree line, moving to the uppermost branches.
         The Hunter travels silently from tree to tree, arriving
         at the canyon rim where far below he SEES in the
         canyon, the BONFIRE, a leaping, shifting, multi-colored
         collage of HEAT WAVES and FLARES, luring him onward.



 179     SCHAEFER                                             179 
 
         hidden back within the deep notch of several large
         LOGS and broken trees, in the river canyon.  Below
         him, on the rock plateau, is the bonfire, illuminating
         in SHIFTING PATTERNS of LIGHT, the awaiting arena of
         destiny.

         His eyes shift, trancelike, moving from side to side,
         watching the approaches to the fire below.  His senses
         are alert; his nerves on a wire edge.



 180     EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  180 

         His SHADOW-FORM descending through the canyon, a
         rippling movement of grays and blacks, passing through
         the shifting light patterns on the rocks, cast by the
         growing bonfire below.



 181     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - NIGHT                         181 

         His eyes probe the canyon, drawn to the swirling
         patterns of HEAT given off by the gaseous COMBUSTION
         of the bonfire.



 182     EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  182 

         Continues on, moving silently down through the canyon.

 183     SCHAEFER                                             183 

         sits motionless, nearly invisible in his mud camouflage
         amid the darkness of the logs.

         Suddenly, over the CRACKLING of the FIRE, the BUZZING,
         CLICKING of INSECTS, and the CROAKING of FROGS, suddenly
         CEASES.

         Slowly, painfully he draws the bow to full arch, his
         wounded shoulder trembling, the BLOOD beginning to seep
         through the bandage.

         The bow straining at full draw, Schaefer stares intently,
         concentrating, searching for the Hunter's form in the
         dancing light below.



 183-A   EXT. THE HUNTER - NIGHT                              183-A

         Like a giant insect, drops from above, fifteen feet
         above Schaefer, his steel-like spurs digging deep into
         the log.



 183-B   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                183-B

         He freezes at the sound of the Hunter dropping, his
         eyes wide with fear.  The slightest movement will bring
         an instant attack from the Hunter behind him.  But to
         wait, his back exposed.



 183-C   EXT. THE HUNTER - NIGHT                              183-C

         Jumps from the log above and to Schaefer's left, onto
         a boulder, gaining a better vantage point of the arena
         and fire below.  He raises his weapon, his EYES
         glistening in the dim light, searching.  A quiet HISS
         emerges from his mouth.



 183-D   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                183-D

         Spins and fires at the movement of the Hunter.



 184     EXT. ARROW - NIGHT                                   184

         Flies into the night, lodging into a BRANCH of an
         exposed tree, just missing the Hunter's head.

         In a blur, the Hunter's arm streaks downward, a dull
         flash of light leaving his fingers as he fires the
         weapon, the projectile STREAKING downward, EXPLODING
         into the log, inches from Schaefer, sending a SHOWER
         of wood chips and bark, flying in every direction.

 185     SCHAEFER                                             185

         in a flash, is up and running, clutching his weapons,
         leaping from boulder to boulder.  He jumps down into the
         lighted area below, landing hard, rolling into the
         protective shadows of the rocks, putting the loping fire
         between he and the Hunter's position on the rocks above.

         He moves forward, darting to look backwards before
         leaping off the lip of the table rock into the boulder
         field below, a flat plane littered by weirdly shaped,
         water-erroded rocks, forming a giant stone AMPITHEATER.
         Shadows leap and dance across the boulders, cast by the
         bonfire from the plateau above.

         Schaefer crouches between two large boulders, quietly
         breathing through clenched teeth, feeling the pain of
         his now freely bleeding shoulder wound.



 185-A   EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  185-A

         A nightmarish silhouette appearing for an instant on the
         rim of the plateau above.



 185-B   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                185-B

         Over the SOUNDS of the FIRE and the softly flowing
         RIVER, distinguishes a NEW SOUND, one that brings fear
         and a savage determination to his heart:  the rhythmical
         CLICK-SCRAPE, CLICK-SCRAPE of the Hunter's feet, moving
         over the rocks, somewhere above him.

         Drawing back on the bow, Schaefer moves around the
         boulder to his left, heading towards the sound of the
         Hunter.

 198     INT. HUNTER. SOMEWHERE IN THE BOULDERS - NIGHT       198

         REVEALED in flashes of strobing light, pauses at the
         juncture of several towering rocks.

         He stands, erect, tilting his head slowly, turning it
         from side to side, his ears trying to orientate to the
         diversity of SOUNDS reflecting off the circular walls,
         enclosing the boulder field.



 199     INT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - NIGHT                         199

         His vision, accustomed to another spectrum, has little
         available heat to register vivid images of the inert,
         lifeless forms of the stones.  He SEES instead, a world
         of soft, ill-defined shapes in a pale MAGENTA field of
         flickering heat.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               92



 200     INT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                200

         Creeping forward, carefully placing one foot in front
         of the other, suddenly stops, hearing the CLICK-SCRAPE,
         CLICK-SCRAPE, now on his right.

         Starting to move in this new direction, he stops again,
         HEARING the sound now directly across from him.
         Listening, he hears the sound again from yet another
         direction, the sound ECHOING in the natural ampitheater
         of rock.

         Schaefer, uncertain of where to turn, waits.  Suddenly
         he crouches and freezes, HEARING the unbelievable SOUND
         of a HUMAN VOICE, softly echoing through the
         ampitheater.

                                 ANNA'S VOICE
                         (o.s.; filtered;
                         in Spanish)
                  Look out, behind you!!!

         Schaefer spins, his breath catching at the sound of
         Anna's voice.  Wide-eyed, straining, he waits, hearing
         only the muted FLOWING of water, the HISSING and POPPING
         of the dying fire above, the shadows growing longer,
         darker with each minute.

         And then again, Anna's VOICE.

                                 ANNA'S VOICE
                         (o.s.; in
                         Spanish)
                  ...Look out, behind you!

                  Anna...?

         Tracelike he moves towards the sound.



 201     THE HUNTER                                           201

         his head canted, throat distended, utters another
         mimicry.



 202     SCHAEFER                                             202

         moving towards the space between two boulders from which
         the VOICE seems to emanate.

 203     THE HUNTER                                           203

         his ears now directed towards the SOUND of Schaefer's
         voice, his slowly approaching FOOTSTEPS, raises his
         weapon.



 204     SCHAEFER                                             204

         pauses before the opening of the passageway.  All is
         silent.  He hesitates to enter.  Listeneing.  He starts
         to move and then hears a NEW VOICE:

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.; Mac's
                         voice)
                  Dillon, over here...

         Schaefer, horrified at the sound of the dead man's
         voice, backs quickly into the space between a boulder
         and the high rock wall of the ampitheater.



 205     INT. HUNTER - SOMEWHERE IN THE BOULDERS - NIGHT      205

         His feet moving quietly over the rock, the shadow-light
         deepening with the dying fire above, closing in.



 205-A   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                205-A

         Bow drawn, trapped against the rock, HEARING the sound
         of the Hunter approaching from the left, now the
         right, is helpless, not knowing where to fire, the
         Hunter's deadly strike only an instant away.

         Still holding the bang-stick in his bow hand, he
         carefully releases the draw on the string, reaching
         to his neck for the FLASH-GRENADE.  With painstaking
         care he removes the grenade from his neck.

         Focusing on the rocks before him and the still
         approaching SOUND, he reaches down with the grenade,
         gripping with his fingertips the matchhead fuse,
         placing it against the rocks at his side.

         With a sudden jerk of his hand he strikes and throws
         the grenade, snatching up the bang-stick with his
         good hand.

 205-A   CONTINUED:                                           205-A

         The matchhead SPUTTERS as the grenade flies through the
         air, an instant later a blinding, WHITE FLASH of light
         illuminates the ampitheater...

         In that instant Schaefer SEES above him and to his left,
         the HUNTER, poised on top of a rock, his weapon raised,
         about to strike!  Momentarily blinded by the flash of
         light, the Hunter's head recoils to the side.

         Darkness swallows the image of the Hunter, but in that
         second, Schaefer seizes his advantage, hurling the
         bang-stick spear.

 214     INT. THE SPEAR - NIGHT                               214

         It smashes into the boulder at the Hunter's feet.  The
         Hunter leaps as the grenade DETONATES, shrapnel tearing
         into his body.

         With a terrifying SCREAM of pain and anger, the Hunter
         clutches frantically at the WOUNDS in his neck and
         chest.  Another bloodcurdling SCREAM OF RAGE and the
         Hunter is gone.



 215     INT. WATERFALL - NIGHT                               215

         Cascades over the rocks, fed by a small stream running
         through the ravine.  A pile of BOULDERS breaks the
         falls, filling the area with an everconstant MIST.

         Schaefer appears, holding the bow and arrow, following
         the LUMINOUS BLOOD TRAIL of the Hunter over the rock.

         Moving behind the falls, Schaefer's body is briefly
         soaked by the water, the hardened and CAMOUFLAGE
         beginning to dissolve, running off his body.  He
         continues on, slowly, cautiously following the blood
         trail.



 216     INT. TABLE TOP BOULDER - NIGHT                       216

         Next to the flowing stream, surrounded by an open area
         of rock.

         Schaefer, smeared with blood and sweat, his clay and
         ochre camouflage partially washed away, climbs up a log
         onto the boulder.  Oblivious to the searing pain in his

         shoulder, he breathes in hot, powerful exchanges, his
         eyes wide and glowing with vengeance.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Bleed, you bastard.

         His bow down, Schaefer follows the blood trail across
         the rock, edging alongside a huge vertical boulder.
         The blood trail stops.

         He takes another step forward, past a darkened ALCOVE...

         Schaefer spins, SEEING in the alcove the SURPRISED
         Hunter whirl and spring towards him...

         Schaefer in a bound closes the distance, savagely
         kicking the Hunter's arm.  The WEAPON flies from the
         Hunter's hand CLATTERING to the rock.

         Before he can recover, Schaefer follows with a karate
         kick to the chest, hurling the Hunter to the ground,
         his back exposed.

         In a flash, Schaefer is standing over the Hunter, the
         bow drawn, poised, the blood from his open wound
         dripping onto the Hunter's back.

         The Hunter slowly rolls onto his back, REVEALING his
         face, his eyes bleached white in shock from the loss of
         blood.  The Hunter's body, rippled out of control,
         trying desperately to orientate itself to the
         environment.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (incredulous)

 217     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. OF SCHAEFER - NIGHT             217

         Schaefer's body, looms over him, MOTTLED and STREAKED
         from his exposed skin, blood oozing from the shoulder
         wound, his eyes like black sockets in his almost
         skull-like face.  Seen from this perspective, Schaefer
         is a frightening, horrible visage.



 218     THE HUNTER                                           218

         shudders, GASPING hungrily for air, strugging to speak.
         From his throat, Schaefer HEARS the feeble, distorted
         efforts of the Hunter, at first garbled,
         incomprehensible and then, slowly, chillingly, taking
         on the timbre and quality of his OWN VOICE.

                  ...You?

         The Hunter's strength seems to fade even more...

         Then, suddenly, with the last of his diminishing
         strength, he lashes out with one arm, activating the
         lethal, razor sharp SPURS on his wrists.

         The Hunter's coiled leg kicks upward with incredible
         force, his terrible spur ripping into Schaefer's thigh,
         hurling Schaefer into the air, flipping him over,
         sending him crashing to his back into the shallow pool
         of water, momentarily losing his bow.  He flounders
         desperately in the water, searching for the bow.  He
         finds it just as...

         The Hunter rises slowly to his feet, GASPING desperately
         for breath.  He inhales deeply, hungrily, gaining
         strength with each breath.

         Schaefer looks from the pool to SEE the Hunter, raising
         his weapon to throw.

         In one totally instinctual movement, Schaefer draws
         back on the arrow to its very tip and fires.

         The arrow, with a deadly THUD, penetrates deeply into
         the Hunter's neck.  Another bloodcurdling SCREAM of RAGE
         as the Hunter clutches his throat, dropping his weapon.
         An instant later and the Hunter is gone.



 219     EXT. LOG BRIDGE - NIGHT (PRE-DAWN)                   219 

         Emerging onto a huge log leading to the rim of the
         canyon, Schaefer holding the Hunter's weapon, pauses
         several times, finding more traces of the Hunter's
         blood, the deep WOUND in his thigh flowing heavily.
         He continues across the log and climbs the bank,
         following the traces into the jungle.

 220     EXT. JUNGLE - PRE-DAWN                               220 

         Moving along the rim of the coulee, Schaefer follows
         the thick, orange blobs hanging on leaves and spent on
         the forest floor.

         Too weak to move through the trees, the Hunter has
         left a SWATH of trampled grasses, broken twigs and
         branches in his headlong retreat from Schaefer:  the
         Hunter turned Hunted.



 221     EXT. TWO ATTACK HELICOPTERS - DAY (PRE-DAWN)         221

         Powering upward from the canyon, the WATERFALL in the
         b.g., clear the rim, racing along at treetop height,
         heading towards the island promontory.



 222     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - CAMP -PRE-DAWN                222

         Staggering into the clearing, bleeding severely.  The
         Hunter is rapidly losing his camouflage ability, his
         skin turning a PALE GREEN, flexing and pulsing in
         shock.  The glow of light from the ENERGY FIELD
         reflecting off the spreading apron of BLOOD flowing
         from his wound.

         With trembling hands he grasps the arrow and breaks
         it, pulling the shaft from his neck.  He screams in
         pain.



 223     EXT. GLEN - PRE-DAWN                                 223

         Schaefer follows the blood trail, deeper into the
         incredibly dense vegetation, ripping aside the heavy
         growth, plunging onward.

         Before him, covering a narrow passageway, is a huge
         SPIDER WEB, intricate, four feet across.  Schaefer
         starts to sweep aside the web.  With a sharp intake
         of breath, he halts, inches from the wed.  Something
         is wrong.

         Examining the web closer he sees not silken threads
         but a hard and shiny network of HAIR-FINE WIRE: A TRAP.

         He backs up, picking up a hefty branch from the ground.
         He swings the branch with a mighty heave, clenching
         his teeth in pain.  The branch sails end over end
         into the web impacting the strands.  A metallic SNAP
         is HEARD; a high-pitches WHINE and the log is violently
         severed, the pieces flying in opposite directions with
         great speed.

         Schaefer runs on, again picking up the blood traces of
         the fleeing Hunter.



 224     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP                                   224 

         At the edge of the site.  He SEES the Hunter staggering
         through the foliage.

         Schaefer starts after him but then stops, dumbfounded
         by the incredible images that crash in on him:
         TRANSLUCENT HUMAN SKINS stretched over frames, the hair
         of the attached scalps moving lightly in the wind;
         SKINNED BODIES, some lying on the ground, others hung
         from the trees, like Hopper and his men were.

         He turns back, SEEING the Hunter as he passes through
         the shimmering distortion of a FORCEFIELD enveloping
         the forest.  Within the force field he SEES the vague,
         nearly transparent OUTLINE of the Hunter's ship.

         He approaches it, wide-eyed, his senses reeling with
         astonishment and rage.

         From within the force field, a PASSAGE WAY of BLUE LIGHT
         appears, the Hunter's form backlit as he ascends the
         RAMP to his spacecraft.



 225-                                                 OUT     225-

 227     THE HUNTER                                           227

         as he passes his hand through a light BEAM, the ship
         instantly responds, as a low, TURBINELIKE HOWL is
         HEARD, building slowly in volume and pitch.



 228     SCHAEFER                                             228

         in his weakened condition staggers forward, looking
         up, SEEING the passage way of light diminish as the
         door begins to close.

         As rising HEAT WAVES begin to envelope the ship, the
         Hunter stares out at Schaefer, the heat waves
         increasing as the KEENING WHINE of the ship's drive
         builds.  He enters the force field, the door now
         inches from closing.

         On the ground, nearly obscured by the grass and leaves,
         Schaefer SEES the Hunter's WEAPON, lying where he
         dropped it in his desperate flight to escape.

 228     CONTINUED:                                           228

         Schaefer grabs up the weapon and holds it.  How the
         hell does it work?...He squeezes the handle of the
         weapon feeling it resist.  Nothing happens.

         With the last ounce of his strength, and with a BELLOW
         of RAGE, his arm muscles bulging, he crushes down on
         the handle...

         In a FLASH of blue-white light, the weapon becomes
         ACTIVATED.

         Schaefer raises the weapon, sensing its power and
         function.

         In the final seconds before the door closes, Schaefer,
         with a triumphant SCREAM, fires the weapon...

         The weapon, flaring with deadly energy, drops and turns
         sideways, accelerating through the door and into the
         spacecraft.



 229     INT. SPACECRAFT - DAY                                229

         The weapon impacts the Hunter, his head EXPLODING in
         a fountain of orange blood and pale green tissue.

         The weapon continues on, burying itself into the energy
         field, bolts of plasma-energy begin arcing from the
         force field.

         Schaefer falls forward onto his hands and knees,
         staring at the Hunter's ship.  The SOUND of the
         hyper-drive continues to increase, as the ship begins
         to tremble.



 230     EXT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT - DAY                        230

         As suddenly the instrument panel goes wild, gauges
         spinning, digital readouts racing out of control.
         The SOUND of the turbine faltering, changing pitch.
         The pilot lurches forward with the stick, fighting
         for control.



 231     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP - DAY                             231

         The multi harmonic whine of the Hunter's ship is
         still building as the ground begins to shake.

         Schaefer, realizing that the ship is going to explode,
         and ignoring the pain of his shoulder and leg, runs
         desperately, searching for cover.  He sprints for

         the edge of the clearing, diving over the embankment
         just as:

         A blinding purple FLASH blows the ship to pieces.



 232     EXT. HELICOPTER - COCKPIT - DAY                      232

         Enveloped in the flash of intense light.  CRIES of
         surprise fill the ship as the SHOCK-WAVE hits the
         chopper, heeling it hard over to one side.

         Below, the concentric waves of energy race outward
         from the center of the blast, an unearthly sight, like
         the miniature birth of a star.

         The helicopter suddenly regains control, its power
         restored.

                                 PILOT
                  Holy, fuck, what was
                  that...?!!!

                                 PHILIPS
                  Orbit right...check it out!

         The helicopter levels out and heads toward the smoking,
         devastated site of the blast.



 233     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP - DAY                             133

         The jungle has been completely transformed.  No longer
         lush and verdant, the area is clear-cut, two feet
         above the ground, covered in FINE WHITE, smoldering
         ASH.  Amongst the shattered stumps, debris from the
         ship, bright as magnesium flares, burns with exotic
         colors.

         If the f.g., Schaefer, a living dead-man, streaked
         with the alien ash, rises up from a shallow depression,
         staring dumbstruck at the site.

         Breaking in low over the treetops, the HELICOPTERS
         flare up into position, one preparing to land.

         As the chopper descends, the crew, standing in the
         door way, stare transfixed at the devastation, their
         eyes trying to penetrate the dense white smoke.

         As the helicopter slowly descends, its propwash creating
         a raging storm, Schaefer materializes from the SWIRLING
         SMOKE AND ASH, his features taking form as he
         approaches, his naked body covered in mud, blood and
         ash.

 234     EXT. SCHAEFER'S P.O.V. - LANDING HELICOPTER - DAY    234 

         As the chopper, emerging from the vortex, settles
         towards the ground where the spacecraft once stood.
         Through the distorted veil, the helicopter, bristling
         with WEAPONS, VISORED and HELMETED MEN, now covered
         with WHITE ASH, looks like a landing spacecraft.



 235     EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                235

         The door gunner swings the M-60 into firing position,
         pointing it at Schaefer.  He racks the bolt, loading
         a round.

         The crewmen look tense, frightened.

         Anna, standing next to the door gunner, stares at the
         strange creature before her, narrowing her eyes,
         uncertain.  Is there something familiar about the
         figure?



 236     SCHAEFER                                             236

         stands in the clearing, staring at the helicopter and
         the array of weapons pointed at him.  He looks dazed,
         like a man making contact with members of an alien
         race, for the first time.



 237     THE HELICOPTER                                       237

         hovers low to the ground, the tension inside building
         as Schaefer approaches.

         More weapons swing into position.  Fingers tighten on
         triggers.  Suddenly Anna recognizes the figure.
         Realizing the danger she holds up her hands, shouting

                                 ANNA
                  NOOOOOO!!!!!!



 238     EXT. HELICOPTERS - JUNGLE - DAY                      238

         Flash overhead, heading across the trackless jungle,
         their rotors THUMPING like heavy machine gun fire.



 239     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                239

         Schaefer, a blanket over his shoulders, still in the
         remains of his mud camouflage, his body laced with
         deep cuts; his chest and shoulder caked with dried
         blood, is seated on a bench in the cargo hold.

         Near the cockpit are General Philips, an ARMY MEDIC,
         two MACHINE GUNNERS.  They look at Schaefer in awe.

         The Medic, holding an open FIELD KIT, a syringe and
         bandages, turns to Philips.

                                 MEDIC
                         (shaking his head)
                  Looks like he's been through
                  hell...can't believe he's
                  still alive.  What the hell
                  went on down there?

                                 PHILIPS
                  If it hadn't been for her, he'd
                  be dead now.  That story she
                  told us...I still can't believe
                  it.

         He looks at Anna, her eyes meeting his, as if asking
         for an explanation.  She looks at him a moment before
         turning back to Schaefer, staring at him as if he were
         risen from the dead.

         She looks into Schaefer's face, Schaefer returning her
         look, recognition passing between them.  Anna extends
         her hand.  Schaefer slowly reaches out, touching her
         fingers, then clasping her hand.

         Schaefer turns his eyes to stare out the open door,
         beyond the passing jungle below, out to the heavens.

         He turns back, looking at Anna, a faint smile crossing
         his face...they made it.

   1     EXT. OUTER SPACE                                       1

         The infinite blackness punctuated by a billion stars.
         As we slowly DESCEND through the varied shades of blue
         of the Earth's atmosphere, we HEAR the first strains of
         a haunting, Central American FLUTE, joined by a swelling
         background of JUNGLE SOUNDS.  We descend further,
         through a lush JUNGLE CANOPY, backlit by a setting sun.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



   2     EXT. JUNGLE COASTLINE - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)               2

         Through a collage of shimmering HEAT-WAVES, a dark,
         OTHER-WORLDLY OBJECT drops INTO VIEW, backlit by the
         fiery, ORANGE-RED sphere of a setting tropical SUN,
         heading slowly towards us, floating, as if suspended by
         the rising heat of the jungle.

         Continuing to approach, the shimmering object resolves
         into a MILITARY ASSAULT HELICOPTER, its rotors strobing
         in the fading sunlight.  Drawing closer, the SOUND of
         powerful TURBINES, throbbing in the heavy air, becomes
         dominant, overpowering.

         Guided by COLORED SMOKE and LANDING LIGHTS, the chopper
         looms hard INTO VIEW, pitching forward and settling to
         the ground, kicking up a maelstrom of dust and vegetation



   2-A   INT. COMMAND POST - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)                   2-A  *

         Where a MAN wearing a military UNIFORM watches through
         the large open windows the helicopter as it continues
         to approach.  Before the skids have even touched down he
         SEES the first of the MEN, dressed in CIVILIAN CLOTHES
         but carrying full COMBAT GEAR, alight gracefully from
         the chopper, double-timing in close order to one side,
         the orders SHOUTED by one man lost in the ROAR of the
         chopper.

         The man turns away from the window, to a FIGURE, hidden     *
         in the shadows.

                                 MAN                                 *   
                  He's here.

         He turns back, lowering a BAMBOO SHADE, obscuring the       *   
         window.

   2-B   EXT. HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT                            2-B  *

         On adjoining PADS, two other HELICOPTERS are VISIBLE; in
         the b.g. can be SEEN several concrete and THATCHWORK
         BUILDINGS, a secret command post disguised as a COASTAL
         FISHING VILLAGE.

         The post in a flurry of activity, AMERICAN ADVISORS
         shouting directions to dozens of LATIN AMERICAN SOLDIERS
         who stand by to assist the landing helicopter and to
         load EQUIPMENT into the other choppers.

         Inside the chopper, one man remains, stretched out against  *
         the bulkhead, as if asleep.  He stirs, sits up, lighting    *
         up a CIGAR.  With fatigue showing in his motion, he leans   *
         forward, descending to the ground.                          *

         A JEEP pulls to stop, the man swinging casually into the    *
         front seat, tossing his GEAR into the rear.  With a         *
         lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post.          *

         In the doorway TWO MEN solemnly watch as the jeep
         approaches.  Reaching the command post the man alights
         from the jeep, heading towards the two men.

         Into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the
         door steps MAJOR ALAN SCHAEFER, the team leader, 38, an
         intelligent and intense man.  He informally salutes,
         GENERAL H.L. PHILIPS, 55, hardened, close-cropped graying
         hair, his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a
         member of an elite commando unit in the U.S. Army.  He
         clasps Schaefer warmly on the shoulder.

                                 PHILIPS
                         (with affection)
                  You're looking well, Dutch.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  It's been a long time, General.

         They walk up the stairs, entering the palapa, leaving
         the other man on guard.



   3     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                      3

         Large, two room concrete floor, thatched walls and roof.
         Behind a partially drawn curtain in the kitchen, a naked
         lightbulb hung from the rafters illuminates a bank of
         compact FIELD RADIO EQUIPMENT, MAPS and AERIAL
         PHOTOGRAPHS.  Otherwise the rooms are primitive and
         stand out in stark contrast to this high-tech invasion.

         Philips and Schaefer enter the room.

                                 PHILIPS
                         (growing serious)
                  We've got a real problem here,
                  something right up your alley.

         They cross to the center of the room to a folding table,
         covered with a large TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP of the Central
         American highland jungle.  Philips leans over the table,
         circling a set of COORDINATES and a MARK on the open
         map.

                                 PHILIPS
                  Eighteen hours ago I was
                  informed that one of our
                  choppers, transporting three
                  presidential cabinet members
                  from this charming little
                  country, was shot down...
                         (point to
                         the circled
                         area)
                  ...The pilots radioed from the
                  ground that they were all
                  alive.  Their position was
                  fixed by the transponder
                  beacon onboard the chopper.
                         (points)
                  Here.

         Schaefer studies the map.  He looks up at Philips.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  That's over the border,
                  General.

                                 PHILIPS
                         (dead serious)
                  That's the problem.  Apparently
                  they strayed off course.
                         (pause)
                  We're certain they've been
                  captured by the guerrillas.

         Schaefer looks up, puffing lightly on the cigar.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (quietly)
                  What have you got in mind,
                  General.

                                 PHILIPS
                  We figure we've got less than
                  twenty-four hours to catch
                  up with them.  After that,
                  there's not much hope.  We
                  want a rescue operation
                  mounted tonight.  That doesn't
                  give you much time.

         Another puff on the cigar.

                                 SCHAEFER   
                  What else it new?  When do
                  we leave?

         Philips looks at his watch.

                                 PHILIPS
                  You lift off in three hours.
                         (pause)
                  There's one other thing.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What's that, General?

                                 PHILIPS
                  Someone else will be going
                  in with you.

         Schaefer stubbs out his cigar in an ashtray.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You know we don't work with
                  outsiders, General.

                                 VOICE
                         (o.s.)
                  Who said anything about
                  outsiders, Dutch?

         Schaefer turns, SEEING the outline of a figure standing
         in the doorway of the communications room, holding a
         sheaf of PAPERS.

         Wearing pressed fatigues, DILLON, mid-thirties, black,
         walks into the room.

         Although as rugged looking as the others, his bearing
         and grooming indicate he's been away from the business
         of soldiering for sometime.  His quick intelligent eyes
         reveal his current profession.

                                 DILLON
                  Last time we danced, it was
                  Lieutenant, Schaefer.

         A grin breaks out across Schaefer's face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Dillon, you son of a bitch.

         The two men step forward and simultaneous swing from
         the hip as it to land a punch...but their hands SLAP
         together in a gesture of friendship, their forearms
         bulging, testing each other's strength.

                                 DILLON
                         (warmly)
                  How you been, Dutch?

         They continue the contest, Schaefer has the edge, forcing
         Dillon's arm slowly downward.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You've been pushing too many
                  Pencils, Dillon.  Had enough?

                                 DILLON
                         (grinning)
                  No way, old buddy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You never did know when to
                  quit.

         They look into each other's faces, each remembering
         something from the past.  A moment's hesitation and they
         quit the contest.  They laugh, Dillon slapping Schaefer
         on the shoulder.

                                 DILLON
                  That piece of work you guys
                  pulled off at the Berlin
                  embassy last week was really
                  something.  Blew the entry
                  points on three floors and
                  neutralized the opposition
                  in eight seconds flat.
                  Beautiful.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Like the old days, Dillon.

                  Also heard that you passed
                  on that little job in Libya.

         Schaefer looks at Dillon, quietly considering him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Wasn't my style.  We're a

                  to come back to the bush.

                  Those cabinet members are
                  very important to our scope
                  of operations in this part
                  of the world.  They're about
                  to get squeezed.  We can't
                  let that happen.  I needed
                  someone who could get the job
                  done, quick and quiet...no
                  screw-ups.  I needed the best.
                  The best.  So, I pulled a few
                  strings at the State
                  Department...and here we are.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Go on.

         Dillon goes to the map.

                                 DILLON
                  The set-up is simple, Dutch.
                  One day job.  We pick up their
                  trail at the chopper, run 'em
                  down, grab the hostages and
                  bounce back across the
                  border before anyone knows
                  we were there.  You've done
                  it a hundred times.  Nothing
                  out of the ordinary.

         Schaefer considers this.

         Philips breaks in.

                                 PHILIPS   
                  I'm afraid those are your
                  orders, Major.  Once you
                  reach your objective, Dillon
                  will evaluate the situation
                  and take charge.

         Schaefer looks from Philips to Dillon.  He still doesn't
         like it.

                                 DILLON
                  Not to worry, Dutch.  I
                  haven't lost my edge.  They've
                  got a head start on us in
                  some real tough country,
                  otherwise, believe me, it's
                  a piece of cake.

         Burst over the top of a ridge.  Rising up in silhouette
         they perform a radical left bank turn and descend
         rapidly into an adjoining valley, racing over the
         jungle at treetop level.

         As the helicopters perform dizzying, high-speed
         maneuvers through the winding canyon, the PILOT'S

   5     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                                5

         Illuminated by the eerie red glow of NIGHT LIGHTS, are
         SEVEN MEN, dressed in jungle camouflage, soft hats and
         camouflage face-makeup.  They wear no identity badges
         or insignias.  The man are checking their WEAPONS,
         making last minute adjustments to their GEAR.

         The compartment reverberates with the NOISE of the
         THUMPING ROTORS and the ROAR of air from the open
         doors.

         BLAIN, weapons and ordinance specialist, a frightening
         bull of a man, a 240 pound killer, removes from his
         shirtpocket a think PLUG OF TOBACCO.  He looks across
         at:

         MAC, a huge bear of a man, black, holding am M-60
         MACHINE GUN.  Blain holds out the tobacco to Mac who
         refuses with a gentle shake of the head, a knowing
         smile, he knows what's coming.

         Holding the plug between his teeth Blain yanks free
         from his shoulder scabbard a wicked, ten inch COMBAT
         KNIFE.  Placing the razor sharp blade next to his lips
         he slices through the plug as if it were butter.  He
         chews throughtfully.

         Seated by the open doorway is RAMIREZ, a slight,
         angular man, an East L.A. streetwise Chicano.

         Adding a final piece of camouflage TAPE to his pack
         HARNESS, he looks up and smiles, faking a throw and
         the bulleting the tape to:

         HAWKINS, the radioman and medic, Irish, street-tough,
         reading a rolled-up magazine, as if he were a rush hour
         commuter.  He snags the tape with an instinctual snap

         of the wrist, continuing to read for a moment before
         looking up, grinning at Ramirez, his boyish, eager
         face belying the rugged professional beneath.  He
         turns his gaze to the man next to him:

         BILLY, the Kit Carson Scout, an American Indian, proud,
         stoic, a man of quiet strength and simplicity,
         carefully replacing the FIRING MECHANISM of his M-203,
         working its action several times.  He looks up with a
         smile at Hawkins.

                         (shouting)
                  Hey, Billy, how many marines
                  does it take to eat a squirrel?

         Billy looks back, shaking his head, uncomprehending.

                                 HAWKINS
                  Two.  One to eat it and one
                  to watch for cars.

         Hawkins laughs heartily at his joke.



   6     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT                                    6

         Clearing another ridge, the helicopters plunge into a
         steep descent, turning quickly into a DEEP-WALLED
         CANYON, the force of the turn accentuated by the
         changing PITCH of the screaming turbines and the
         biting of rotors into the air.



   7     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                                7

         The men, suspended in RESTRAINING HARNESSES from the
         bulkheads, lean forward, nearly upside down in response
         to the radical maneuver, handling the situation with
         ease.

         Blain holds out the tobacco to Ramirez, who swats at
         the offending object as if it were alive.

         Grinning, Blain proffers the plug to each man, each one
         refusing; they've done it a thousand times.  It's an old
         gag but they obviously care for the man in a big way.

                                 BLAIN

                  just like me.

         This brings a chorus of HOOTS and SHOUTS from the others.
         The helicopter makes another radical turn.

         Schaefer and Dillon, seated near the cockpit, communicate
         through HEADSETS, also linked to the pilot.  They
         consult a TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP by RED PENLIGHTS.

   8     INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT                                   8

         The PILOT and CO-PILOT are surrounded by an array of
         dimly lit GAUGES and SWITCHES.  Before the Co-Pilot is
         a RADAR SCREEN and an INFRA-RED DISPLAY TERMINAL on
         which the TWO HELICOPTERS appear as HEAT SOURCES.

         The Pilot throws a SWITCH on the panel before him

         A BLUE LIGHT appears on the forward bulkhead.  Schaefer
         is speaking over a RADIO TELEPHONE.  The Co-Pilot turns
         and hands him a clipboard.  Schaefer reads, notes his
         approval and hands it back.



  10     EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                               10

         Flares up into position over the jungle and hovers, as
         the SUPPORT HELICOPTER holds in a protective position
         above.



  11     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                               11

         Dillon seems comfortable with the men, showing Ramirez
         a battered CIGARETTE LIGHTER from a famed commando
         unit from the past.

         But his ingratiating demeanor is not impressing Mac, who
         regards Dillon with the cold suspicion reserved for an
         outsider.  Mac looks up at Blain, his eyes narrowing.

         Blain's massive jaws roll as he masticates the chew.
         He pauses, eyes moving downward, spotting his target.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

         He hocks a thick, vile stream of TOBACCO JUICE directly
         between Dillon's legs and onto the floor, a gelatinous
         skein lacing across the toe of one boot.  Dillon looks
         up, his face goes cold and menacing.

                                 DILLON
                         (icy)
                  Man, that's a real bad habit
                  you've got.

         Dillon turns back to Ramirez, ignoring Mac and Blain,
         who continues to stare at him.  Mac looks across at
         Blain, wide grins breaking across their huge faces.
         Cradled in Blain's arms, as if it were a part of his
         body, is a large, CANVAS-COVERED BUNDLE.  Blain looks
         down at his bundle, almost affectionately.

         The PILOT's VOICE breaks in over Schaefer's headset.

                                 PILOT NUMBER ONE
                         (voice over)
                  LZ comin' up in 30 seconds.
                  Stand by the rappel lines.

         Looking up, Schaefer gives a hand signal to the nearest
         man who nods and in return,passes the signal down the
         line.

         Ramirez and Blain pick up heavy, METAL CONICAL DEVICES,
         attached to canvas bags filled with rope.



  12     EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                               12

         From the open doors the RAPPELLING LINES hurtle into
         space, CRASHING through the double canopy of the trees
         and to the jungle floor below.



  13     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                               13    *

         The blue light changes to GREEN.  Schaefer nods.
         RAPPELLING DEVICES SNAP into place.  Gloved hands grab
         onto rope.  Combat boots move into position.

                                 DILLON

         Schaefer signals.  Men leap from the chopper.



  14     EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT                                   14

         The man crash through the trees and are swallowed up by
         the darkness below.  The helicopters depart, THUMPING
         their way into the night.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:



  15     EXT. MOUNTAIN RIDGE - DAY (DAWN)                      15

         A light shower passes through the trees.  The sky
         clears, REVEALING a lush and exotic foliage.  Birds
         are beginning to SING but otherwise, all is SILENT.

         The dense growth seems impenetrable, but from a solid
         wall of undergrowth, a HAND appears and signals in a
         downward motion.

         As if by magic, the assault team materializes, quietly,
         cautiously.  Schaefer makes another gesture and the team
         moves forward in perfect harmony in POINT-LOCK step,
         taking their cue from Ramirez, the pointman.  Schaefer,
         highly focused and alert to every sound and movement,
         follows Ramirez, as if organically connected.



  16     EXT. JUNGLE HILLSIDE - DAY                            16

         Descending the steep mountain slope, the team encounters
         an even denser growth of jungle, at times moving by
         instinct, as they are often visually separated.  At one
         point, Schaefer checks his COMPASS, flashing some hand
         signals to Ramirez, indicating a new direction.  Ramirez
         nods and moves on, Schaefer signaling to the rest of the
         men.



  17     EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY                            17

         Blain, in a defensive position, sweeps the jungle slowly
         with his MP-5.  He steps back and turns, checking,
         revealing in the b.g. the WRECKAGE OF A U.S. ARMY UH-1H
         HELICOPTER, hanging upside down, twenty feet above the
         ground, entangled in vines in the heavy capony, badly
         damaged, rotors bent, its tail section blown away.

         A GRAPPLING HOOK is hurled from the ground, CLATTERING
         into the cargo hold, hooking the edge of the airframe.



  18     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                 18

         Ramirez moves cautiously, searching for trip wires,
         using his knife to check the edges of the seats and
         door frames.  Grimly he glances at the TWO BODIES
         slumped over the controls and then exits, snapping
         into and rappelling down the rope to the ground.

         He joins Schaefer standing in the f.g.  They look
         up, watching as Dillon moves through the cockpit,
         searching through pockets and compartments.  Schaefer
         turns his back to the helicopter.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  The pilots have each got one
                  round in the head.  And whoever
                  hit it stripped the shit out of it.

         Schaefer studies the clearing, eyes always moving, wary.
         He turns back, looking at the chopper.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Took 'em out with a heat seeker.

                                 RAMIREZ    
                  There's something else, Major...

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Mmmnnn...?

                                 RAMIREZ
                  I don't think that was any ordinary
                  army taxi...

         Schaefer looks at him quizically.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  ...looks more like a surveillance
                  bird to me.

         Dillon rappells down the line and approaches.

                                 DILLON   
                  Have you picked up their trail yet?

         Schaefer taps Ramirez on the shoulder and he moves
         away.  Schaefer turns to Dillon:

                  They're getting better equipped
                  every day.

         Bill approaches from the b.g.

                                 BILLY
                  Major, looks like there were ten,
                  maybe twelve guerrillas.  Looks
                  like they took some prisoners
                  from the chopper.
                         (points)
                  Then a different set of track,
                  over there.

                         (puzzled)
                  What do you mean?

                  Six others, U.S. issue jungle
                  boots.  They came in from the
                  north, then followed the guerrillas.

         Schaefer turns to Dillon.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Mean anything to you?

                  Probably another rebel patrol.
                  They operate in here all the time.

         Schaefer is obviously concerned about this.  He
         turns to Billy.

                  Get ahead, see what you can find.

                  Same business, guerrillas
                  hauling two guys from the
                  chopper...followed by men
                  with American equipment...

         Ramirez seems concerned by this.  Schaefer signals him to   *
         move on.  Before he follows, Schaefer looks around:  there's*
         something dodgy about this.  He goes.                       *

         Over his head is a butterfly on a limb:                     *



  20     EXT. JUNGLE - OVERHEAD - DAY                          20

         As the assault team passes below, a BUTTERFLY lands on
         what appears to be the BARK of a TREE.  It fans its wings
         and flies on.

         The impression of the butterfly remains in PERFECT
         RELIEF, as is imprinted on the bark.  The image fades,
         REVEALING for an instant a gridwork of TINY SCALES on
         the bark.

         The bark moves!  Changing colors, like a chameleon,
         REVEALING for an instant the form of something alive
         as it flows into the leaves, once again becoming
         indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage.

         TWO EYES, faintly flowing yellow, appear in the
         foliage.  They blink, disappearing, and then become
         VISIBLE again.

         SEEN THROUGH HEAT-SEEKING VISION, studying the team's
         careful, silent movements at they pass by.

         The SOUNDS of the FOREST are also ALTERED and ENHANCED
         with an electric, STATICLIKE quality.

         The Observer scans over the men...and then focuses
         on Schaefer as he crouches down, signaling forward
         and rear with a circular motion.  He refers to an
         OBJECT in his hand, studying it carefully.

         Using a MAP in lining out a course on his COMPASS.  The
         other team members appear, silently, clustering around
         him.  Using hand signals, Schaefer indicates a course
         change.

         signals, instructing his team.

  26     EXT. DENSE UNDERGROWTH - DAY                          26

         The hillside of a steep valley, dark and foreboding.
         Billy passes by and halts, removing his KNIFE.  With
         his other hand he pulls down from overhead a THICK VINE,
         severing it.  A thin stream of WATER emerges which
         he drinks.

         Suddenly he stops, letting the water drip to the
         ground.  He quietly releases the vine and brings his
         M-203 shotgun to bear, listening intently.  Something
         seems wrong.  He brings his eyes upward and stares,
         hard into the treeline of the opposing hillside.

         As his eyes strain to penetrate the dense, intertwined
         canopy, he is engulfed by the rising SOUNDS of the
         JUNGLE, a cacophony of BUZZING and CLICKING,
         amplified in the sweltering heat of the day.  Unable
         to locate a source to account for his anxiety, he
         relaxes, moving on, resuming the track.



  27     BILLY (MINUTES LATER)                                 27

         examines the ground as he moves, growing confused
         and puzzled by what he sees before him.  He stops,
         scrutinizing the jungle, probing the world around him
         with his keen senses.

         HEARING a faint RUSTLING SOUND he looks up, SEEING a
         curtain of MOSS several feet away.  He takes a cautious
         step forward, extending his weapon.  He reaches
         forward with his free hand, touching the moss.

         Behind the curtain a slight shifting of DARK FORMS
         occurs.  He pauses and then with a sudden movement,
         sweeps the moss aside...

         A BLACK EXPLOSION of FLUTTERING WINGS as carrion-eating
         BIRDS rush past Billy's body.

  27     CONTINUED:                                            27

         Billy's face seizes into a mask of horror, his
         expression descending into a state of complete,
         primitive shock, his eyes staring transfixed, inches
         away from the leering death-grin of a HUMAN FACE,
         upside down, completely stripped of skin.

         Reeling, his body numbed by the sight before him,
         he stumbles backwards and stops.

         Vines threaded through their achilles tendons, the
         BODIES OF THREE MEN, skinned and gutted, hang
         suspended in the think, suffocating air, BUZZING
         with insects.

         Billy turns away, revulsed as Ramirez moves quietly
         INTO VIEW, Schaefer directly behind him.  Ramirez
         stares at the bodies, now seen to be in the first
         stages of deterioration, strips of flesh torn away
         by the birds and other scavengers.  In an almost
         childlike manner, he crosses himself.

                                 RAMIREZ   
                         (hoarse whisper)  
                  Holy Mother...

         Schaefer moves into the clearing, kneeling beside
         a bloody pile of CLOTHING and ENTRAILS.  He examines
         the clothing and then rises, holding a DOG TAG on
         a broken chain.  He reads the tag, his face growing
         hardened and bitter as he stares down at the tag,
         recognizing the name.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to himself)
                  J.S. Davis, Captain, U.S. Army...

         Schaefer's eyes move from the bloody dog tag to
         the bodies.

                                 SCHAEFER   
                         (coldly)  
                  Mac.  Cut them down.

         Mac moves forward, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE.
         The blade flashes, cutting the vine as the first
         body THUDS to the ground.  He bends over, picking up
         other DOG TAGS.

         Schaefer turns to Dillon.

                  I knew this man.  Green Berets,
                  out of Fort Bragg.  What the hell
                  were they doing in here?  You got
                  any answers for this, Dillon?

                  Uh...I wasn't told of any
                  operations in this area.  They
                  shouldn't have been here.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (angry)
                  Well somebody sent them.

         Schaefer walks off.  Mac steps out of the clearing,
         sheathing his knife with a violent gesture, passing
         Ramirez.

                         (seething)
                  Must have run into the guerrillas
                  ...Fucking animals.

         Mac moves alongside Blain.

                                 MAC
                         (spits)

                         (looks at Blain)
                  Time to let 'ol 'painless'
                  out of the bag.

         Grimly, Blain RIPS apart the velcro closures of the
         CANVAS BUNDLE slung across his shoulder, REVEALING
         a truly awesome weapon, a SIX-BARRELED MINI-GUN adapted
         for field combat.

         Kneels at the side of the original trail examining the
         ground.  He rises, holding a spent CARTRIDGE.  Schaefer
         approaches, kneeling beside him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What happened here, Billy?

         Billy looks at him, puzzled.

                  Strange, Major.  There was a
                  firefight.  Shooting in all
                  directions.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I can't believe Jim Hopper
                  walked into an ambush.

                                 BILLY
                  I don't believe he did, Sir.
                  I couldn't find a single track.
                  Just doesn't make sense.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What about the rest of Hopper's
                  men?

         Billy shakes his head.

                                 BILLY
                         (uncomfortably)
                  No sign.  They never left here
                  Major.
                         (pause)
                  It's like they just disappeared.

         Schaefer ponders a moment.  Then, to Billy:

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Stick with the guerilla trail.
                         (to team)
                  Let's get it over with.  We move.
                  Five meter spread.  No sound.
                  Nothing.

         Blain feeds the magazine of BELTED-SHELLS into the
         weapon, cocking it.  He looks up at Mac, his eyes
         cold, his face taut with anger.

                                 BLAIN
                  Payback time.

         Blain hefts the Mini-gun to his hip as Mac draws back
         slightly on the breech bolt of the M-60, letting it
         snap.

         They move on, Billy pausing to look at the jungle
         before disappearing into the foliage.

         carefully watching this exchange from high in the
         treetop canopy.  The Observer watches as Schaefer
         turns and leaves the clearing, cautiously moving
         into the jungle.



  30     EXT. JUNGLE HILLSIDE - DAY                            30

         Mac appears suddenly, materializing out of the
         undergrowth, pausing cautiously, his senses alert,
         intense, almost nervous.  He moves on, his huge body
         barely making a sound as he weaves through the heavy
         undergrowth.

         Dillon appears.  As he moves on, he crosses over a
         fallen TREE.  Stepping down, his foot breaks through
         a rotten portion, a CHUCK of the log breaking free
         and rolling down the hill.

         Dillon at once goes into a defensive position,
         listening.  The jungle is SILENT.  He stands and
         starts to move forward.  Suddenly Mac appears
         within inches of Dillon's face.  Mac's face is
         menacing, angry.

         Dillon's eyes are wide and fixed, staring back in
         cold hatred at Mac, controlling his rage...he knows
         the rules.

         Not waiting for a response, Mac turns and vanished
         into the jungle.  Seething with anger Dillon
         focuses on a still moving LEAF and STEM, indicating
         Mac's exit point.  He moves on.

         Crouches under heavy foliage, waiting.  He is
         joined by Mac.  They glance briefly at each other,
         scanning in opposite directions for movement and
         sounds.  They speak in whispers.

                                 BLAIN

                  winding up like those
                  bastards back there.

         Mac, sweating heavily, wipes the moisture from
         his brow with his finger.

         Blain pats the mini-gun affectionately.

                                 BLAIN
                  I know what you mean, Bull,

         each other.  Two men who have seen it all,
         through a dozen no-win situations, and have lived
         to tell about it.

         Mac advances a few meters and signals slowly.



  32     EXT. KNOLL                                            32

         The assault team moving up the hill, barely
         visible in the heavy foliage, the team moves
         cautiously into defensive positions.  Holding.
         A moment later they continue up the hill,
         crawling.

         On their stomachs, Schaefer and Ramirez clear
         the edge of the knoll, SEEING below a GUERRILLA
         VILLAGE, a huge, spreading PALAPA covering
         implacements dug into a hillside, descending
         to a winding stream bed below.  30 MEN, dressed
         in a mixture of jungle fatigues and civilian
         clothes, armed with AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES move
         about the camp.  A heavy MACHINE GUN emplacement
         guards the entrance to the camp.  TWO MEN sit
         in the camouflaged emplacement.



  33     SCHAEFER                                              33

         sweeping the camp with BINOCULARS, SEES a
         GUARD above the camp.  One of the man picks up
         a hand-held ROCKET LAUNCHER, placing it beside
         a bandolier of ROCKETS and a RADIO SET and
         CONSULS taken from the U.S. surveillance
         helicopter as if preparing to take them away.

         Schaefer puts down the glasses, looking at
         Ramirez who nods in acknowledgment.  A sudden
         MUFFLED CRY brings Schaefer's attention to one
         end of the camp, where a heavily thatched DOOR
         covers and opening to the PALAPA.  A GUARD
         stands at the door.

         The door flies open as a HOSTAGE, shirtless,
         hands tied behind his back, staggers through
         the door as if kicked from behind.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

  33     CONTINUED                                             33

         The man falls to the ground, feebly trying to regain
         his footing.  Although difficult to see from Schaefer's
         vantage point, the man's battered face and welt-covered
         back indicate he has been severely tortured.

         Emerging from the palapa, a GUERRILLA LEADER,
         moustached and wearing a SIDEARM, approaches the
         beaten man, kicking him viciously in the stomach,
         rolling him to his side.

         Kneeling beside the man he withdraws an AUTOMATIC from
         his holster and cocks the hammer.  Grabbing the man by
         the hair he jams the muzzle into the man's ear and with
         a violent twist, pulls the trigger.

         The guerrilla leader stands and strides quickly back
         to the palapa, still holding the pistol, closing the
         door behind him.



   34    SCHAEFER                                              34 

         grim-faced at having witnesses the murder, lowers him
         glasses, a look of cold determination on his face.
         Quickly he and Ramirez ease down the escarpment,
         joining the other team members.

         Schaefer makes a circling motion with his thumb
         and the team members gather in close, huddle formation.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (whispering; angry)
                  Just killed one of the                             *
                  prisoners.  No time for                            *
                  invitations.  We take them,
                  now.



  35     EXT. BLAIN AND MAC - DAY                              35

         Crawl silently through the underbrush.  With nearly
         impreceptible movements, Blain slips out of the
         cartridge pack, ditching the Mini-gun.  He withdraws
         his COMBAT KNIFE, placing it between his teeth.

         They move through the underbrush in tandem, like
         two bug cats, stalking.  Mac freezes, the sweat
         pouring from his face, holds up his hand as Blain
         stops.

         Using a BLADE OF GRASS, Mac points out a metal TRIP
         WIRE, following it to a hidden CLAYMORE MINE.  Blain
         grins making a switching GESTURE.  Carefully Mac
         detaches the LEAD WIRES.  Directing the mine towards
         the camp, he reattaches the wires, nodding at Blain.



  36     EXT. JUNGLE - OVERHEAD - ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY         36

         SEEN THROUGH HEAT-SEEKING VISION, FOCUSED ON Blain
         and Mac, lying in the grass below, their bodies
         outlined in LUMONOUS AUREOLES.  The Observer SEES the
         NETWORK of TRIP WIRES guarding the approaches to the
         machine gun nests.  The wires GLOW as if ELECTRIFIED,
         standing out in hard-edged relief in contrast to
         the jungle foliage.  He moves higher into the forest
         canopy.



  37     EXT. BILLY - DAY                                      37

         On Schaefer's signal rises up, pulling a SENTRY to
         him, covering his mouth with his hand, jerking him
         backwards and to the side, knocking him off balance
         with a sweeping motion of his left leg, killing him
         with his COMBAT KNIFE.



  38     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   38    *

         Belly crawls silently through the tall grass just
         outside and above the main entrance to the camp.  He
         stops, studying the ancient, rusted skeleton of a
         TRUCK parked on a level spot above the camp, its
         engine quietly IDLING.  The truck is jacked and
         blocked up, one rear wheel attached to a belt-drive
         leading to a PUMP, drawing water from a river nearby.
         In the open cab of the truck a GUARD is on duty,
         watching the high ground above the camp.

         Schaefer moves out, heading for the guard.



  39     EXT. MACHINE GUN EMPLACEMENT - DAY                    39

         While one Guerrilla attends to his equipment, the
         OTHER attentively watches the approaches to the camp.
         He is momentarily distracted by a BUZZING FLY, which
         he annoyingly swats at with his hand.

         He hears something to his side.  Turning to investigate,
         the huge, hamhock fist of Mack smashes into his throat.

         Simultaneously, Blain rises up behind the other man,
         grabs him by the hair, pulling him down, his COMBAT
         KNIFE driving downward.

  40     EXT. TRUCK - DAY                                      40    *

         A SATCHEL CHARGE is looped over the gearshift lever,
         resting on the floorboard.  Schaefer, lying low
         across the seat of the truck, turns and looks, SEEING
         the guard, lying in a heap in the foliage.



  40-A   EXT. RAMIREZ - DAY                                    40-A  * 
  
         Moves into position to the side and above the camp.
         He carefully checks the readiness of his SIX-SHOT
         GRENADE LAUNCHER, also setting his MP-5 in front of
         him, ready for action.



  41     EXT. SCHAEFER                                         41    *   


         Crouched to the side of the truck, watches the camp,
         SEEING below through the dense undergrowth, Ramirez,
         barely visible, signaling.

         Before him are two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES.  He looks
         at his watch, and then up the hill to:



  41-A   DILLON AND HAWKINS                                    41-A  *

         their weapons ready.  Dillon picks up his binoculars,
         focusing on the machine gun emplacement, seeing a MAN,
         his face covered by a HAT.  The head rises, REVEALING
         the face of Blain, who looks above the camp and
         slightly nods.  Putting his glasses down, motions
         to Hawkins.

                                 DILLON
                         (to Hawkins)
                  Ready, kid?

         Hawkins grins back.  Together they slip through the
         grass, downward towards the edge of the camp.

         Holds his huge, COMMANDO MACHETE on a diagonal,
         pushing through the belt, slicing it cleanly.  Turning
         he crawls silently to the rear of the truck,
         positioning himself behind the rear of the one ton
         truck.

         He squats, and with an enormous, concentrated effort,
         deadlifts the rear of the truck, its rusted springs
         and frame beginning to CREAK and GROAN slightly.

         With a herculean effort he lifts the truck free of
         its blocks and then pushes forward.  He rolls aside,
         disappearing into the ground cover as the truck, its
         tireless rims digging into the earth, lops down the
         hill, slowly picking up speed.



  45     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE - DAY                          45

         A Guerrilla, alerted by the SOUND of the approaching
         truck, looks up at the hillside, SEEING the vehicle
         still moving down the hill at a moderate roll.  He
         CALLS OUT and several Guerrilla leaves their posts,
         moving out to prepare to stop the truck.

         The truck rolls into the clearing picking up speed,
         heading towards the main palapa.  The men rush
         forward, surrounding the truck, trying to slow it
         down, but the truck rolls, SMASHING through the front
         wall of the palapa.  The men gather around truck
         and then look back up the hill.



  46     EXT. ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                             46    *

         Watching as Schaefer pulls the pin and launches the
         GRENADE into the air, the Observer following its
         arc as it spirals dead-center into the camp, bouncing
         twice before rolling into the FUEL DUMP...which a
         moment later, EXPLODES into an incredible FIREBALL.

         The expanding FIREBALL released from the explosion
         is to the Observer like an erupting sun, momentarily
         blinding him.



  47     EXT. GUERRILLA CAMP - DAY                             47

         The truck is BLOWN up into the air by the explosion...
         a moment later the satchel charge DETONATES with an
         ear-splitting EXPLOSION, tearing the truck apart.



  48     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   48

         Jumps to his feet, FIRING an M-203 round into the
         camp.



  49     EXT. KNOLL - DAY                                      49

         Schaefer races down the hillside, joined by Dillon,
         leaving Hawkins to cover them.  Bullets burst around
         their feet as they run low, firing short bursts to
         his left and right.

         He FIRES the undermounted GRENADE LAUNCHER, sending a
         round into a gun position in the trees.  Still running
         he breaks open the breach, slamming in another 40mm
         ROUND from the cartridge pack at his waist.

         Blain and Mac fire the heavy machine guns, laying down
         a withering curtain of lead, shredding the camp,
         taking out five Guerrillas at once.



  50     EXT. GUERRILLA CAMP - DAY                             50

         A MAN almost completely ON FIRE is hit by an onslaught
         of GUNFIRE, ripping him back into the jungle.

         Ramirez cuts loose a barrage from the SIX-SHOOTER...
         seconds later the MACHINE GUN IMPLACEMENT erupts in
         a series of EXPLOSIONS, blowing two Guerrillas into
         the air.

         At the HILLSIDE HUT, two Guerrillas move into position
         by the window, drawing down on Schaefer as he appears,
         racing down the hill.

         As they are about to open fire, Dillon appears,
         YELLING OUT a warning.

                                 DILLON
                  On your nine!!!

         Schaefer dives, hitting the ground as Dillon OPENS
         FIRE taking out the Guerrillas.  Schaefer rolls to
         his feet, spins, firing the 203 grenade launcher,
         completely destroying the hut.



  51     EXT. ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                             51

         As the Observer regains its vision an eerie, surreal
         experience of sight and sound unfolds:

         BULLETS streak through the air, leaving blood-red
         trails of HEAT, like laser blasts.  As they impact
         into the Guerillas, we HEAR the enhanced SLAPPING
         of BULLETS, SEEING tiny blossoms of HEAT mushroom
         out of their bodies.

         We HEAR the horrific, deformed CRIES and SCREAMS
         of the dying men.

         Another searing, blinding EXPLOSION sends pieces of
         SHRAPNEL ripping through the air, some of them
         ROARING past the Observer's position, like tiny
         meteors.

  52     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE                                52    *

         at the entrance way to the main palapa, a Guerrilla
         stands in the doorway, giving COVER FIRE to his comrades
         as they fall back inside.

         Jumping from the roof of the adjoining palapa, Billy
         drops directly in front of the Guerrilla.

         From the side, unseen by Billy, another Guerrilla           *
         thrusts out with a knife, Billy ducking backwards, the
         tip of the knife SLASHING his face.  With a lightning
         move, Billy whips his arm up and around the Guerrilla,
         locking his elbow, breaking the joint.

         Still holding the man he FIRES, blowing the other
         Guerrilla off his feet with the SHOTGUN portion of his
         weapon.  He looks at the Guerrilla out of the corner of
         his eye.  He suddenly strikes, breaking his neck,
         dropping him in a heap.

         Billy continues on, racing down the stairs, firing the
         M-203.

         Meanwhile, Blain is crouched next to a tree, providing      *
         cover.  Behind Blain, at the edge of the camp, circling
         around from below, TWO GUERRILLAS appear and FIRE a
         grenade round which EXPLODES behind Blain, fragments
         ripping into the tree next to which Blain is standing,
         bark and dirt flying as shrapnel rips into his vest, one
         piece tearing into his upper shoulder.  The hits have
         no effect on the huge man and with a savage GROWL, he
         spins, opening fire, raking the two attackers with the
         Mini-gun.

         Nearby, Mac charges from the jungle on a dead run,
         diving over a fallen tree as machine gun FIRE rakes the
         ground around him.

         Blain, spotting the sniper high in a tree, opens FIRE
         with the MINI-GUN, shredding the tree, sending the
         Guerrilla crashing down through the roof of the
         palapa.



  53     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                     53

         The sniper CRASHES through the roof, landing on the
         floor near Hawkins and Ramirez who do a quick double
         take before opening fire on a group of fleeing
         Guerrillas, taking out two, giving chase to the others.

         Schaefer and Dillon appear at the top of the staircase,     *   
         Schaefer freezing as he SEES below a Guerrilla raising
         an AK-47, preparing to fire.  Schaefer tackles Dillon,
         the two men hurling into the air, a moment later BULLETS
         ripping into the CRATES behind where they were standing.

         Dillon rises up, kicking over a crate, shooting the         *
         Guerrilla who is trying to bring the gun around to fire
         at him.

         Schaefer crouches, covering the upper entrances to the      *   
         palapa, as Ramirez rushes past, joining Schaefer.  From
         the corner of his eye, Schaefer catches a movement.
         With a whipping, backhanded throw, he lets fly his
         COMMANDO MACHETE...

         The machete impales the attacking Guerrilla, driving him    *   
         backwards, pinning him to a post.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Stick around.

         Schaefer and Ramirez run towards the lower levels, side
         by side, firing as they go.

         They reach a door, Schaefer taking out an ATTACKING
         Guerrilla.  Ramirez grabs the side of the door, shoots
         a look to Schaefer and throws it open.  With Schaefer
         covering him, Ramirez takes a quick peak inside and
         then rushes into the room.

         At one end is a STAIRWAY, leading to an escape door.
         A Guerrilla, seen from the waist up, scrambles down
         the stairs.

         At the base of the stairs, a Guerrilla, holding an
         AK-47 on his hip, turns and starts to fire.

         Schaefer and Ramirez respond with full AUTO BURSTS
         which rip into the Guerrilla, spinning him around,
         knocking over a crude WOODEN TABLE, scattering a
         BRIEFCASE with burning PAPERS, FOOD CANS, and LIQUOR
         BOTTLES.

         As he spins he FIRES the weapon, an arcing line of SLUGS
         slamming into the tin roof, sending down a shower of
         rust and dirt.  He falls to the ground.  Dead.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

  53-A   CONTINUED:                                            53-A

         Ramirez charges through the DUST and thick SMOKE to
         cover the fallen men; Schaefer following close behind,
         jerking a new CLIP from his ammo belt.

         Suddenly, another Guerrilla erupts from behind some
         ammunition crates, drawing down on Ramirez with a
         machine pistol.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (shouting)
                  Down!!!

         As the Guerrilla fires, Schaefer smashes the butt of
         his empty weapon into the Guerrilla's shoulder, knocking
         the gun aside, the SLUGS thudding into the wall
         harmlessly.

         He hits the Guerrilla with a vicious glancing blow to
         the head with the barrel of his weapon.  The Guerrilla
         is hurled backward, crashing into the wooden crates and
         to the floor.

         Ramirez, recovering quickly, descends the stairs with
         catlike agility, disappearing.

         Schaefer crouches and spins, jamming a new clip into the
         rifle, scanning the palapa for any other movement.  He
         races to the main door of the room, shouting into the
         palapa.

         He SEES Blain charging down the steps.  Catching his
         attention he signals him on, out the back to cover
         Ramirez.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Hawkins)
                  Hawk, Get Con. Op. on the
                  hook!  Position and situation,
                  now!

         As Blain runs down the stairs, Hawkins already has the
         radio off his back, setting up the portable SATELLITE
         DISH ANTENNA.

                                 HAWKINS
                  You got it, Major!

  53-B   EXT. PALAPA - WATER AREA - DAY                        53-B

         Ramirez, Blain and Billy race down the back stairs
         of the palapa, FIRING Mini-gun, automatic and grenade
         rounds at the escaping GUERRILLAS as they flee the area,
         splashing, charging across the shallow river.

         The guerrillas are history...in no uncertain terms.



  53-C   INT. PALAPA - DAY                                     53-C

         For the first time, Schaefer studies the interior of
         the cavernous palapa, SEEING the enormous stockpile
         of WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT and SUPPLIES stacked along the
         walls, obviously a major military stronghold hidden
         deep within the mountains.  Mac hustles up to Schaefer,
         a look of urgency on his face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Any sign of the hostages?

                                 MAC
                         (nods)
                  We found 'em both, dead.
                  And the gear from the chopper.
                  If they're Central American,
                  I'm a fuckin' Chinaman.  By                        *
                  the looks of 'em, I'd say our                      *
                  cabinet minister and his aide                      *
                  are CIA.
                         (pause)
                  Another thing, Major, we were
                  lucky...couple of those guys
                  we waxed are Russians,
                  military advisors by the look
                  of it.  Something big was
                  about to happen here.

         Schaefer looks at Mac a moment, a flush of anger
         beginning to show.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Good work, Mac.  Clear the
                  area, no traces.  Get the men
                  ready to move.

         Schaefer goes back into the room, looking down at the
         unconscious guerrilla, racking a round into the
         chamber, reloading his weapon.

         He kneels, staring into the FACE of a WOMAN, ANNA,
         dark, late twenties.  Despite her blood and
         dirt-smeared face, she is beautiful.

                  Shit...

         He checks her pulse and then slowly he bends to pick
         up her PISTOL, ejecting the clip.  He stands, beginning
         to shuffle through the PAPERS scattered about the room.
         Staring at one he looks up, the pieces falling together.



  54     EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                     54

         Ramirez, at a crouch, runs through the jungle,
         following the obvious signs of the Guerrilla's
         retreat.  He emerges from the trees into an opening,
         leading to a sheer rock cliff, towering fifty feet
         above the ground.  Scanning the wall, he SEES
         movement and quickly takes cover, as automatic
         FIRE rips up the ground before him.



  54-A   EXT. ROCK WALL - DAY                                  54-A

         Near the center of which a narrow cut, two feet
         wide, leads to the top of the cliff, giving access
         to the adjoining ridge.

         Two Guerrillas scramble up through the chimney,
         assisted by a ROPE, which with withdraw as they
         reach the top.  Ramirez takes out one man, the
         other taking cover, returning fire.



  54-B   EXT. BASE OF ROCK WALL - DAY                          54-B  *

         Blain joins Ramirez, behind cover at the foot of
         the cliff.  As they take cover, Ramirez notices
         the wound on Blain's shoulder.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  You're hit.  You're bleedin',
                  man.

         Blain looks briefly at the wound.

                                 BLAIN
                         (spits)
                  Ain't got time to bleed.

         On a signal, they both clear cover and fire LONG
         BURSTS from their weapons up the cliff.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

  54-B   CONTINUED:                                            54-B

         The smoke is hardly cleared when they are answered
         by withering FIRE.  They duck down as a grenade
         EXPLODES nearby.  Ramirez quickly replaces the 40MM
         rounds into the SIX-SHOOTER.

                                 BLAIN
                  Son of a bitch's dug in like

                  ...jack us around all day.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Hell, dude, we don't have all
                  day.

         Ramirez immediately rolls into the line of fire,
         BLASTING six RAPID-FIRE shots on a HIGH-ARC trajectory
         towards the rocks.  Blain reacts.

                                 BLAIN
                  Shit, Pancho!!!

         Blain dives against the protective cover of the
         rock wall, covering his head.  Ramirez casually
         hops across, squatting next to Blain.  They make
         eye-contact.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  What's your problem, dude?

         Before Blain can answer, Ramirez puts his fingers
         into his ears and grimaces just as...

         The entire hillside EXPLODES, blowing the Guerrillas
         into the air, a torrent of vegetation and earth
         raining down the cliff, obscuring Blain and Ramirez.



  55     INT. PALAPA ROOM - DAY                                55

         Schaefer is staring out the window, his weapon slack
         in one arm, still holding the paper.  Dillon enters,
         obviously excited about what he has found.  He sees
         the papers on the floor.  He reads through them
         quickly, growing even more excited.

                                 DILLON

         Schaefer turns, striding slowly to Dillon, handing him
         the paper he is holding.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I think this is the one you want.

         Dillon reads it.

                         (reacting)
                  Two days...that's all we had.
                  In two days, three hundred of
                  these bastards would have been
                  equipped with all this.  After
                  they crossed the border, it
                  would have taken a year to
                  stop them.

                  We've averted a major

         Schaefer moves in close to Dillon, face to face,
         anger flaring in his eyes.

                         (quietly; in Spanish)
                  Are you all right?



  55-A   INT. PALAPA - DAY                                     55-A

         Schaefer is talking to Hawkins who has the field
         radio set on a crate just outside the door.

                                 HAWKINS
                         (urgent)
                  Major, we stepped into some
                  real shit here.  I got a hook-up
                  with aerial surveillance.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Movement?

                                 HAWKINS
                         (nods)

                  Place is going down, Major.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  How much time?

                                 HAWKINS
                  Half an hour, maybe less.                          *

         Schaefer touches him on the shoulder.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (urgently)
                  Tell Mac we move in five.

         He starts to walk away.

                                 DILLON
                         (o.s.)
                  She goes with us.

         Schaefer turns.  Dillon is at the doorway, supporting
         the still groggy Anna.

                                 DILLON
                  She's too valuable.  She's
                  got to know their whole
                  network.  The whole set up.
                  We take her with us.                               *

                                 SCHAEFER
                  We take her and she'll give
                  away our position, every
                  chance she gets.  No
                  prisoners, Dillon.

         Dillon grabs the handset from Hawkin's radio, shoving it
         at Schaefer.

                                 DILLON
                  You're still under orders,
                  Dutch.  You want to make the
                  call, or should I?

         Schaefer looks at the handset.  Then at Dillon, he knows
         Dillon's won.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

         He starts to walk away but stops, turning back, pointing
         a finger at Dillon.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I'm getting my men out of this
                  damn jungle, Dillon.  She's
                  your baggage.  You fall behind,
                  you're on your own.



  56     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE - DAY                          56

         Schaefer and Billy are kneeling on the ground near the
         trailhead, studying a MAP.  In the b.g., the team, hidden,
         covers the hillside approaches to the camp, nervous and
         wary, weapons ready.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  This place is too hot for a pick-up.
                  They won't touch us until we're over
                  the border.  We can lift at LZ 49,
                  here.
                         (points to map)
                  Spotter plane says we're cut off.
                         (points to map)
                  Except for this valley.

         Billy shakes his head, following the CONTOUR LINES of
         the rugged terrain.

                                 BILLY
                  Looks bad, Major.  It's gonna be
                  a real bitch.
                         (points to map)
                  If we follow above the river and
                  then down, here, at this canyon,
                  we might find a way out.

         Schaefer turns to Ramirez, kneeling close by.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (decisively)
                  Not much choice.  Pancho, take
                  the lead.  Double time it.

         He turns and looks at Dillon, Anna as his side, her
         forehead bandaged, her hands bound in front of her.
         He turns back to the others.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Lock n' load, watch your ass.

         Blain moves out, swinging the Mini-gun in front of him
         as he goes.

  56-A   EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. - DAY                          56-A

         Watching as Dillon leads ANNA onward, SEEING her bound
         hands.  Dillon pushes her.



  57     EXT. ANNA - DAY                                       57

         Spins, hurling a string of insults to Dillon in
         SPANISH.

                                 ANNA
                         (in Spanish)
                  You touch me again, pig, and
                  I will cut off your balls!

                                 DILLON
                         (in Spanish)
                  It's a long walk back, make it
                  easy on yourself.

         She spits at him, turning forward with a twist of
         her head.

         Dillon picks up his back, shouldering it.  As they
         move on, Mac calls out to him.

                                 MAC
                         (quietly)
                  Hey, Dillon, over here.

         Dillon doesn't respond.

                                 MAC
                         (louder)
                  Dillon, over here.

         Dillon turns and approaches, warily, holding
         the girl.

                                 DILLON
                  Yeah, what is it, Sergeant?

         MAc unsheathes his knife.  He gives Dillon a cold
         look and turns him by the shoulders.  Crawling
         across the PACK on Dillon's back is a huge SCORPION.

         Mac skeweres the scorpion with the tip of his
         blade, holding it before the wincing Dillon.  Anna
         smirks, nodding to the writhing, stinging insect.

                                 ANNA
                         (in Spanish)
                  When my people catch you,
                  you'll wish you were him.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

  57     CONTINUED:                                            57

         Dillon looks at Mac.

                                 DILLON
                  Thanks.

                                 MAC
                         (coolly)
                  Anytime.

         Mac flings the scorpion to the ground, crushing it
         with his boot.  He looks up at Dillon, walks away.
         Dillon follows, pulling Anna behind him.

         Billy, guarding the rear, glances furtively around
         the clearing.  He moves a step forward and stops,
         freezing.

         Slowly he turns back, his eyes riveted upon the
         treeline above the camp.  His eyes strain, his
         senses registering a fear he cannot name or see.

         Something is out there, in the trees, waiting,
         watching.

         Billy turns and walks into the jungle, pausing
         one last time to look behind him before he too
         disappears from sight.

         The jungle GROWS SILENT.



  58     EXT. OBSERVER'S ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                  58

         LOOKING DOWN from his vantage point TO the treeline
         below, terraces like stepping stones, FOCUSING ON
         a TREE, fifty feet away.

         The Observer utters a LOW TRILL and springs outward
         into space, hurtling downward towards his landing
         point, the canopy of the trees approaching in a
         staccato rush of green.

         The SOUNDS of the FOREST are again altered and
         enhanced with an electric, STATIC-LIKE quality as
         the Observer descends fluidly through the trees
         and to the ground.

         He enters the camp, surveying the terrible
         destruction and carnage.  He SEES the dead
         Guerrillas, the dissipating heat from their bodies
         leaving them pale and GHOST-LIKE, as if fading
         light about to extinguish.  He sees their weapons,
         the cold hard steel of the barrels registering
         ICE BLUE in his vision.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               42



  58-A   EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. OF HIS HAND - DAY              58-A

         As it appears, pulsing in a pale magenta heat, low
         to the ground, holding his weapon.  He lays down
         the weapon, picking up the SCORPION, turning it
         slowly in his fingers, examining it.  It looks like
         an exotic flower, its color fading from sight,
         turning to BLACK.

         A low SOUND is uttered, something vaguely familiar
         about it:  A NEARLY HUMAN VOICE, a distorted
         imitation of Mac.

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.; filtered)
                  Dillon, over here.

         Again the phrase is uttered, improving, closer to
         Mac's inflection and accent.

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.)
                  Dillon, over here.

         The Hunter lowers the pitch.

                                 HUNTER
                         (o.s.)
                  Dillon, over here.

         The last effort is a chilling simulation of Mac's
         voice.



  59     EXT. OBSERVER'S HAND - DAY                            59

         Drops the scorpion and picks up the weapon which
         changes instantly back to the Observer's skin tones.



  59-A   EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. - DAY                          59-A

         He turns and focuses on the area where the team
         left camp.

         He crouches and springs to the lower branches of a
         tree, grasping them with his clawed, three-fingered
         hands, pulling himself up and through the branches
         with astounding speed and simian-like dexterity; his
         spurred prehensile feet, grasping and thrusting him
         to a vantage point, fifty feet above the ground.

         As he moves on, the jungle grows suddenly QUIET, as
         if aware, sensing that the HUNTER is now stalking, no
         longer observing!!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               43



  60     EXT. JUNGLE VALLEY - DAY                              60

         The twilight world of a PREHISTORIC FOREST, filled
         with gigantic plants and towering trees, overgrown
         with vines and creepers.

         The team, with Billy at point, walk alongside a
         wandering STREAM BED, weirdly illuminated by SHAFTS
         OF LIGHT, streaming through openings in the trees,
         as if from spotlights, a hundred feet above.

         It is midday, hot and humid, the air BUZZING with the
         sounds of insects, the CRYING of birds and monkeys.
         The men are moving fast and quiet, straining to see
         into the dense jungle, aware of every sound, sweating,
         quietly slapping at biting insects.



  61     EXT. GIANT HARDWOOD TREE - DAY                        61

         Lies across their path.  As the man climb over a
         rotten section, Mac stops to assist Blain with his
         Mini-gun.

                                 MAC
                  I've seen some badass bush
                  before, but nothin' like
                  this, man.
                         (pause)
                  Little taste 'o home?

         Blain nods and pauses to rest, looking around him
         as Mac withdraws a small silver POCKET FLASK.  He
         takes a nip, passing the flask to Blain who also
         takes a sip.

                                 BLAIN
                  I hear you bro, this is some
                  shit.  Makes Cambodia look
                  like Kansas.  Lose your way
                  in here, man, you be in some
                  kinda hurt.

         Blain hands back the flask, Mac replacing it inside
         his vest.  They do their hand dap, looking warily
         behind them before they move on.



  62     EXT. ANNA AND DILLON - JUNGLE - DAY                   62

         Have fallen behind, Dillon looking worriedly ahead
         at the them out distancing them.  Anna is keeping
         her pace purposefully slow.  She trips on a root
         falling to the ground.  She lies there, motionless.
         He quickly reaches down to haul her to her feet.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 DILLON
                         (urgently)
                  Shit.  Come on...

         Like an uncoiled spring, Anna turns, flinging a
         handful of DIRT into his face, momentarily blinding
         him.  She lunges for his rifle with her bound hands.

         Suddenly the BARREL of an MP-5 is thrust into her face.

         Looking up she SEES Ramirez, calmly holding the weapon
         on her, the look in his eyes indicating he'd hove no
         trouble shooting her.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (in Spanish)
                  Don't try it.

         She looks back at Dillon, wiping the dirt from his eyes.
         She moves on.  Ramirez gives him a cold look as Dillon
         hurries past.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (coolly)
                  You should put her on a leash,
                  Agent Man.  If you can't handle
                  her, just say the word.

         Dillon moves on, ignoring Ramirez, who turns, scanning
         the jungle behind him before moving on.  Dillon catches
         up with Anna, turning her sharply by the chin.

                                 DILLON
                         (cold; in Spanish)

         She looks at him contemptuously, undaunted.  She will
         try it again.  She breaks away from his grasp and
         moves on, Dillon watching her go, he won't hesitate
         next time.



  63     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            63

         As he travels, directly overhead, timing his movement
         with those of the team.  He moves lower, closer to
         the slowly moving humans.



  64     EXT. RIVER BED - DAY                                  64

         The team moves cautiously through the winding stream
         bed, now wearing their clothing in various stages of
         disarray for comfort, sweat dripping from their bodies.

  64     CONTINUED:                                            64

         Billy, in the lead, picks his way along the riverbank,
         his concentration rapt, aboriginal.  His face a
         trancelike mask of expectation.

         Blain, cradling the heavy Mini-gun as if it were a
         toy, swings the weapon relentlessly across his field
         of view.  He pauses to adjust the hanging, belted
         loop of cartridges trailing from the back pack
         magazine.  An INSECT lands on his face and is trapped
         in the grease paint near his lips.  He draws the
         hapless bug into his mouth with his tongue and quietly
         spits it out, his concentration unbroken.

         Mac follows, holding the M-60 high across his chest.

         Schaefer, bent, cautious, his feet moving aside the
         dry leaves on the ground, heel to toe and on foot
         edges.  He glances around, checking the team's
         position and progress.

         Hawkins follows, his mouth open, breathing deeply,
         exhausted, the radio a 60 pound demon.

         Anna, struggling to climb a section of the stream
         bank, slips on some loose dirt.  Unable to assist
         herself with her hands tied, she nearly falls.
         Dillon prods her with his rifle, forcing her to
         her feet.  She scrambles up the bank, Dillon following.



  65     EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY                                 65

         As Billy enters a small clearing, bordered on one
         side by the towering trees, carpeting the
         mountainside.  High above in the thick, impenetrable
         treeline, brightly colored birds SQUAWK loudly,
         chasing each other from branch to branch.

         Suddenly Billy stops.  Schaefer holds up his hand
         and the team freezes in position.  An eerie SILENCE,
         like a slowly falling curtain, descends over the
         jungle until even the BUZZING and CLICKING of insects
         have CEASED.



  66     EXT. TEAM MEMBERS - DAY                               66

         Sensing an ambush, move quietly into the foliage.
         Dillon moves into the undergrowth, dragging Anna
         with him.  He slings his MP-5 over his shoulder,
         withdrawing his KNIFE.  Grasping Anna by her shirt
         collar and pushing her to the ground he holds the
         weapon near her throat.  Dillon signals to Ramirez          *
         who approaches.  Dillon hands Ramirez the knife.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                  Watch her.

         Before Ramirez can respond, Dillon slips into the
         undergrowth.  Ramirez holds the knife on Anna,
         cautiously scanning around him for movement.

         Unseen by Ramirez, Anna's outstretched hands slowly
         tighten around a stout ROOT-BURL, lying loose on the
         ground.



  67     EXT. BILLY - AT THE RIVER BED - DAY                   67

         He remains frozen and transfixed, staring into the
         treeline.  Something is moving, fluid, silently and
         downward, into the forest.  Billy remains rooted to
         the spot, lost in concentration.



  68     SCHAEFER                                              68

         sensing something very wrong with Billy, moves alongside
         Mac.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What's got Billy so spooked?

                                 MAC
                  Can't say, Major...been
                  squirrely all mornin'...
                  fuckin' weird...sometimes
                  I think that nose of his is
                  too good...smells things that
                  ain't there.

         Schaefer signals for Mac to cover him and then moves low
         and quiet towards Billy.  Dillon appears, looking to
         Mac for an explanation.  Mac ignores him, concentrating
         on the jungle.  Dillon looks forward at...

         Billy, his eyes riveted to the capony above, as he
         unconsciously reaches to his throat, grasping a LEATHER
         POUCH, secured to his neck by a thong.  He fingers the
         MEDICINE BAG talisman.



  69     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            69

         As he slowly descends through the trees, moving
         towards Billy, who's eyes search the treeline for
         movement.

  70     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                                70

         approaches Billy, gripping his shoulders and in a
         hoarse whisper, speaks his name.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What is it...?

         Billy, rigid, does not respond.  Schaefer forcefully
         jerks his around to face him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Billy...What the hell's wrong
                  with you?

                                 BILLY
                         (low)
                  Something...in the trees...



  71     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            71

         Still closing in on Billy.  Billy turns back, looking
         high into the trees, puzzled and frightened.  He's
         lost sense of the Hunter's presence.  He lowers his
         vision, looking towards the Hunter, now on the ground,
         30 yards across the clearing from Billy.  The Hunter
         pauses.



  72     BACK TO SCENE/BILLY AND SCHAEFER                      72

                                 BILLY
                         (whispers)
                  Can you see anything...
                         (points)
                  ...there?

         Schaefer stares hard at the jungle.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  It's...nothing...



  73     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            73

         Moves behind a broad fern, skirting around Billy
         and Schaefer, heading away from the column.



  74     BACK TO SCENE/BILLY AND SCHAEFER                      74

         Schaefer shakes his head, continuing to stare into
         the jungle.  He turns to Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  What do you think...?

         Billy turns, a puzzled look in his eyes.  He nods
         in agreement.

                                 BILLY
                  It's nothing...



  75     EXT. ANNA AND RAMIREZ - DAY                           75

         Sensing the danger has passed, Ramirez releases his
         grip on Anna.  As they start to rise, Ramirez sheaths
         his knife and unslings his MP-5.  Anna still stares
         hard into the jungle.

         Suddenly, without even looking, Anna with the trained
         reflexes of an experienced fighter swings the BURL with
         all her might, catching Ramirez hard on the side of the
         head, just above the eye, opening a wicked gash.
         Spinning around she knees him brutally in the groin.
         As Ramirez goes down, doubled over in pain, Anna turns,
         scrambling up the embankment, running for the jungle.

         Ramirez CRIES out.



  76     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   76

         HEARING Ramirez' cry, Schaefer signals to Hawkins to
         move.  Hawkins moves out, fast, heading towards the
         sound...



  77     EXT. HAWKINS - DAY                                    77

         SEES Anna running away.  He gives chase.
         Anna, although bound, is light and fit and runs fast,
         hurdling fallen logs and branches, charging through the
         undergrowth.  SHe has a good start.

         Hawkins, hampered by the radio and weapon but in
         tremendous shape, thunders after her, closing the
         distance.



  78     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            78

         As he passes from behind a large tree, surrounded by
         dense foliage, SEEING the fleeing Anna.  He watches
         her and then begins to move parallel with her, only
         faster, the green of the jungle rushing by in a blur.



  79     EXT. ANNA AND HAWKINS - DAY                           79

         Anna, bursting through a grove of ferns, drives on,
         breathing hard with the exertion.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

  79     CONTINUED:                                            79

         Hawkins, ten yards behind, closing the distance,
         taking advantage of any hesitation Anna makes,
         struggling with the dense jungle.

         Anna hits a small clearing, an alleyway through
         the trees.  She sprints hard across the clear
         ground.



  80     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            80

         Moving through the jungle.  As he steps clear of
         the foliage he SEES Anna driving hard into the
         alleyway, running directly towards him.  Twenty
         yards away, Hawkins, closes in.



  81     BACK TO SCENE/HAWKINS                                 81

         Only a few feet behind Anna, lunges forward, knocking
         her to the ground.  In a second he's on her, his
         weapon ready.  She struggles to her feet, fighting,
         gasping for breath.  Hawkins holds the MP-5 on her,
         looking at her, almost pleading.  He doesn't want
         to shoot her, but he will if he has to.

                                 HAWKINS
                  Please...

         She looks at the weapon, to Hawkins and then,
         hopefully, to the jungle.  She stops, staring hard
         down the alleyway.  Something...suddenly she sees it!


                                 ANNA
                         (in Spanish)
                  Look out, behind you!!!

         Hawkins spins...



  82     EXT. HAWKINS AND ANNA'S P.O.V. - DAY                  82

         SEEING the MOTTLED OUTLINE of the Hunter's body,
         racing towards them, as if the entire wall of the
         jungle were rushing in.  The Hunter's WEAPON
         flares to life.



  83     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - ANNA AND HAWKINS - DAY         83

         As he hurtles towards them, their faces frozen in
         surprise.



  84     BACK TO SCENE/ANNA AND HAWKINS                        84

         A splitting THUD as Hawkins is hurtled backwards into

         She SCREAMS as Hawkins' MP-5 FIRES a short BURST
         into the air.

         HEARING the GUNFIRE, Schaefer WHISTLES low and sharp.
         Ramirez, face bloody, swings into action, moving in a
         coordinated defensive/offensive pattern into the
         jungle.



  86     HAWKINS/BACK TO SCENE                                 86

         The Hunter's ARM and SPUR hook into Hawkins' leg, and
         he is dragged into the jungle.



  87     EXT. RAMIREZ - DAY                                    87

         Ramirez runs forward ten paces, drops to a crouch,
         scanning to each side.  Immediately Schaefer runs
         forward twenty paces.  As he passes Ramirez, Ramirez
         turns and scans the rear and flanks.

         Dillon, Mac and Blain repeat the maneuver, leap-frogging
         forward, canvassing the jungle, providing areas of
         intersection cover.



  88     EXT. RAMIREZ                                          88

         Entering the alleyway where Hawkins was killed he SEES
         Anna, cowering in the bushes, her blood splattered
         face glazed with terror, his eyes vacant.  He
         approaches, angry, wary, but the girl is so stunned.
         He SEES the trail of BLOOD and CRUSHED GRASSES leading
         into the jungle.  He gives a LOW WHISTLE and then moves
         on, the rest of the team assuming defensive positions
         around the clearing.

         He follows the trail, finding first Hawkins'
         blood-covered weapon, and then, a few yards later,
         the radio.  Ramirez cautiously parts the brush before
         him.  A look of puzzlement and then revulsion comes
         of his face.



  89     EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY                                   89

         Blain and Mac at either end, cautiously searching
         the jungle; Billy covering their flanks.

         Schaefer and Dillon approach Anna.  She seems unaware
         of their presence, staring numbly ahead.  Schaefer
         checks her out, looking for wounds, he wipes some of
         the blood from her face.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  It's not her blood.

         Ramirez emerges from the jungle carrying Hawkins'
         MP-5 and radio.  He approaches, dumping the equipment
         on the ground.

         Dillon in the b.g., as Ramirez parts the brush with
         his weapon.  Before them, covered with dirt and
         leaves, are Hawkins' ENTRAILS.  There is no body.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  There's no sign of it.



  91     EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY                                   91

         The entire team is gathered, still holding defensive
         positions.  Anna, still stunned, is beginning to
         come around.  She looks up at Schaefer.  He turns to
         Ramirez.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Ramirez, ask her what
                  happened.

         Ramirez drops to one knee and talks softly to her in
         SPANISH.  She mutters incoherently in Spanish, still
         dazed, shaking her head.  Dillon listens closely to her
         response.  Ramirez turns to Schaefer.  He seems
         confused.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  She says...the jungle came
                  alive, and took him...

                                 DILLON
                  That isn't what she said...
                  she said...
                         (pondering; to
                         Ramirez)
                  ...she doesn't make sense.

                                 RAMIREZ
                         (growing angry)
                  Couple of sappers been
                  trailing us all the way from
                  the camp, Major.  Billy heard
                  them.  She set us up, ran
                  for it...They were waiting.
                  I should've wasted the bitch
                  when I had the chance.

         Schaefer, looking at Hawkins' bloodstained equipment
         lying at Anna's feet, looks up.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (quietly)
                  Why didn't they take the
                  radio and his weapon?
                         (pause)
                  Why didn't she escape?

         Ramirez and Dillon look at the equipment and then
         to the girl, still numb with shock.

                                 DILLON
                         (grimly; remembering)
                  They did the same thing to
                  Davis...

         The two veteran commandos look at each other, finding
         no explanation between them.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (urgent; to the others)
                  I want him found.  Sweep
                  pattern and double back.  Fifty
                  meters.

         They move out.  Schaefer moves into the jungle,
         searching.  He crouches at the base of a huge
         MAHOGANY TREE, covered with vines, studying the
         jungle.  He moves away from the tree and into the
         forest, looking for signs on the ground.

         Where he was sitting, a DROP OF BLOOD falls.  Another
         drop falls, dripping from a leaf and above that, from
         another leaf.  Above that, high in the top of the
         tree, SUSPENDED from vines from his ankles, is
         HAWKINS' BODY, his chest a gaping wound.

         He hands there as if he were an animal, field dressed.



  92     EXT. BLAIN - DAY                                      92

         Crouched in the undergrowth.  There is a movement in
         the brush before him.  He wipes the sweat from his
         eyes and clicks his safety on the Mini-gun to fire.

         The SOUND is growing closer.  Blain levels the weapon.
         A smile crosses his face.

                                 BLAIN
                         (whispers)
                  Come on in you fuckers...come on
                  in.  'ol 'painless' is waitin'...

         The movement in the brush is GROWING LOUDER.  Blain's
         finger moves closer to the trigger.

         Suddenly a small TAPIR bursts through the leaves,
         startling Blain.  He relaxes momentarily as he
         watches the animal scurrying from sight.  He
         stands...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

         SOMETHING grazes his shoulder, a gout of BLOOD erupting.
         He starts to turn, the Mini-gun held low, ready to
         fire...

         ...from out of the jungle, 75 feet away, the Hunter's
         WEAPON streaks toward him like a missile.  He SCREAMS
         as it enters his back, erupting from his chest in an
         EXPLOSION of BLOOD.



  93     EXT. MAC - DAY                                        93

         Has heard Blain's cry.  He moves fast through the brush.
         He HEARS a RUSTLING in the bushes.  A wet SUCKING SOUND.
         Mac charges into the clearing.  In the instant before
         the Hunter disappears into the forest, Mac SEES a vision
         so brief and fantastic that it seems like a
         hallucination.

         The Hunter's EYES flare momentarily from the green
         before they vanish.

         Mac sees his friend, lying on the ground, his chest
         open, the powerful man, dead.

                                  MAC
                         (shouting)
                  Contact, 30 Right!!!

         He OPENS FIRE with his M-203, belted shells slamming
         into the weapon from the magazine at his waist,
         expending it in one LONG BURST.
 


  94     EXT. THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS - DAY                     94

         Flying through the jungle, weapons ready, eyes searching
         for movement.



  95     EXT. MAC - DAY                                        95

         He throws down the weapon and with a cry of rage, lunges
         forward, grabbing the Mini-gun.  As he stands, the
         CARTRIDGE BELT, attached to Blain, strings out between
         them.

         He opens FIRE and the foliage before him EXPLODES with
         the fury of the terrible weapon.  Mac sweeps the
         Mini-gun from left to right, like a man possessed,
         mowing down the jungle.

         The other team members race INTO SIGHT and begin firing
         with Mac.

         launcher...EXPLOSIONS rock the jungle.



  96     EXT. HUNTER - DAY                                     96

         Moving.  A piece of SHRAPNEL cuts his shoulder.  A
         splash of ORANGE BLOOD spatters across the LEAVES
         of a nearby tree, bullet holes ripping through the
         surrounding foliage.



  97     BACK TO SCENE/MAC                                     97

         More FIRING.  Mac, his weapon expended, continues
         to thrust the Mini-gun forward, still squeezing the
         trigger.

         Suddenly, as quickly as it started, THE FIRING STOPS.
         The men move catlike into the jungle, reloading,
         searching, their nerves taut, stretched to the limit,
         ready to fire again at any second.

         Mac is frozen, eyes wide, unblinking, his breath
         coming in rapid gasps as he stares into the jungle,
         still squeezing the trigger of the weapon, its
         breech locked open, GUNSMOKE wafting from the chamber
         and barrel.

         Schaefer moves in front of Mac, still staring into the
         jungle.  Dillon pushes Anna into the clearing, moving
         towards the body.  Anna looks at the body and then up
         to Mac.  Schaefer sees a terrifying moment of
         recognition flash in her eyes as she continues to
         stare at Mac.  He turns to Mac.

                                 MAC
                         (confused)
                  I...saw it.

         At these words, Anna reacts in shock, drawing a             *
         slight breath.  Schaefer turns, sees her staring at         *
         Mac.  He turns back.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You saw what?

                                  MAC
                         (still dazed)
                  I saw it.

         Schaefer turns back to see Anna, staring fixidly at Mac,    *
         watching his lips.  Schaefer turns quickly to Blain's       *
         body and kneels alongside Dillon.



  98     SCHAEFER                                              98

         is at Blain's side, shocked at the sight of the
         mutilated body.  He is joined by Dillon.

                  cauterized...what the hell
                  did this?

         Schaefer stands, looking at the body.  In the b.g.
         Anna drifts away from the group.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Mac)
                  ...Mac!

         Mac stares ahead, dumbly, not hearing.  He grabs Mac
         by his shoulders, shaking him violently back to
         awareness.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (demanding;
                         angry)
                 Mac!  Mac!  Look at me!

         Mac turn to face Schaefer, a shocked expression on his
         face.

                         (urgent)
                  Mac, who did this?

         Mac is suddenly angry and frustrated, he has no
         explanation.

                                 MAC
                  I don't know.  Goddamn it,
                  something...I saw something/.

         Ramirez runs from the jungle, breathing hard, shaking
         his head.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Nothing.  The same thing.

         Mac stands.  Instinctively the team has now grouped
         around Schaefer, their weapons pointing into the jungle,
         ready, their nerves on total edge.  Schaefer looks
         upward at the darkening sky.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (quietly)
                  We're losing the light.  Mac,
                  I want a defensive position
                  above this ridge, mined with
                  everything we're got.

         Man is again the hardened professional.

                  Yessir.

         Schaefer looks down at Blain's body.  He turns to
         Ramirez and Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Put him in his poncho and
                  liner and carry him back.
                  We'll bury him in the morning.

                  I'll take him.

         as they leave approaches the brush, her attention
         focused on something clinging to the leaves, well off
         to the side of where Mac saw the Hunter.  She draws
         closer, reaching out, hesitant, as if drawn magnetically
         to the leaves.



 100     EXT. DETAIL - HUNTER'S BLOOD - DAY                   100

         Clinging to the leaves, thick, viscous, pale-orange,
         almost like the sap of an exotic plant.  Her fingers
         hover above it, hesitantly, and then touch it.



 101     ANNA                                                 101

         examines the blood, transfixed.  Dillon appears at her
         shoulder, startling her.  He motions for her to return.
         She turns, wiping the blood onto her pants leg.



 102     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DUSK                               102

         The team is dug into the foxholes in a dense grove of
         trees, a solid wall to their backs.  The men are barely
         visible they blend in so well.

         Nearby, Mac is stringing a TRIP WIRE, low to the ground,
         covering it with leaves and grass.  He moves into camp
         and reports to Schaefer.

                                 MAC
                  We've got most of the flares,
                  frags. and two claymores just
                  outside.  Nothin's comin'
                  close to here without trippin'
                  on somethin'.

                  Thank you, Sergeant.

         Mac starts to go but Schaefer places his hand on his
         shoulder.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I'm sorry, Bull.  It's never
                  easy.  He was a good soldier.

                  The best friend I ever had.

         Mac turns and walks through the camp, stopping beside
         a DARK OBJECT on the ground.  He kneels beside the
         PONCHO pulling back the zipper REVEALING Blain's face,
         looking peaceful in death, as if lying in state.

         Mac removes something from his pocket, holding it in
         his hand, studying it.

         The small WHISKEY FLASH, the chrome rubbed away in
         places REVEALING the brass beneath and a MEDALLION
         depicting the 101 1ST AIRBORNE DIVISION.

         takes a tiny sip from the flask.  He replaces the cap
         and lifts the flap of Blain's shirt pocket, placing
         the flask inside.  He lingers on the face and then
         closes the zipper.

         is huddles into a foxhole, her hands still tied in front
         of her.  She looks down at her pants leg.  The Hunter's
         BLOODSTAIN glows with a faint luminosity.  She places
         her fingers near the stain.

         Hawkins' BODY impacts the floor with a THUMP.



 107     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY (DUSK)                         107 

         A momentary HUSH falls over the symphony of night
         sounds.  Anna and Billy turn towards the trees with a
         growing look of wariness.  The others, setting up the
         RADIO, show no response.

 

 108     INT. HUNTER'S SHIP - DAY (DUSK)                      108 

         The Hunter's foot steps on the upper leg of the corpse,
         the PREHENSILE SPUR digging deep, pinioning the body
         to the ground.  The Hunter's HAND extends, his
         FINGERS puncturing the skin at the base of the spine,
         gripping the vertebrae.

         With otherworldly strength the arm pulls, the entire
         SPINAL COLUMN ripping free from the body, a sickly
         SNAPPING and POPPING of cartilage separating from bone
         and tissue.

         He puts down the phone, turning to the group, huddled
         together in a tight circle, Ramirez and Billy facing
         outward in defensive positions, Anna, silent, watching.
         Schaefer is look at him.

         Dillon glares back.  Schaefer leaves, lost in thought.
         Ramirez looks up at the impenetrable canopy.

                  earth could have lived...not

         Dillon ponders this for a moment, staring hard at Mac.
         Mac gets up.

                  I've got the first watch.

         Mac departs.  Dillon watches Mac as he creeps forward
         to the sentry position.  He turns to Ramirez.

                                 DILLON

         Ramirez turns to Anna.  They talk quietly in Spanish,
         Dillon watching, listening carefully.  Ramirez turns
         back to Dillon.

                  She says the same thing...
                  It was the jungle...

         Ramirez looks up at Billy who continues to stare into
         the jungle, aware, catlike, reacting to every sound,
         his nerves on edge, as if ready to snap.  Ramirez
         rises, moves alongside his friend, Dillon watching
         closely.

         Billy turns, his face a mask of primal fear.  He moves
         close to Ramirez.

                                 BILLY
                  I'm scared.

         Ramirez is frightened by this.

                         (shaken)
                  Bullshit.  You ain't afraid
                  of no man.

         Billy looks deep into his eyes, chilling Ramirez to the
         bone, looking at his with eyes which have seen on an
         instinctual level what the others have so far only begun
         to sense.

                                 BILLY
                  There's something out there,
                  waiting for us...it ain't

         Billy turns away, moving a short distance away, taking
         up his position.  Dillon looks after him and then into
         the blackness of the jungle canopy.  Dillon speaks to
         Ramirez.

                                 DILLON
                  He's losing his cool.  There's

                  have to take down.

         Despite his words, there is an edge of doubt in his
         voice.  Schaefer returns.  He's overheard this exchange.
         He's holding the group of DOG TAGS taken from Davis' men.
         He holds them up for Dillon to see.

 110     INT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           110 

         CLOSE ON an oval CHAMBER made of an otherworldly looking
         metal with a strange copperlike patina, its interior
         bathed in INTENSE BLUE LIGHT.  In the chamber is
         Hawkins' SKULL CAP and SPINAL COLUMN still attached.

         The light field suddenly changes as all connective
         tissue, flesh and blood and drawn away from the bony
         structures with incredible force, disintegrating as they
         rush toward the sides of the chamber.

         The light changes in frequency to a dull glow as the
         Hunter's hands remove the GLAZED, POLISHED trophy from
         the chamber.  He turns, carefully placing it upon a
         GLOWING SURFACE.  He touches the trophy gently, feeling
         its texture, as a man might touch the hide of a big cat.
         He pulls his hand away and instantly an opaque FORCE
         FIELD covers the trophies.



 111     EXT. MAC - NIGHT (LATER)                             111 

         Hunched down in a foxhole, the Mini-gun on a tripod
         before him.  It's nearly a FULL MOON, the jungle a
         montage of SHADOWS AND REFLECTIONS.  Mac stares into
         the night, his eyes always moving.

 112     INT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           112

         A FORCE FIELD that permeates the jungle, becoming one
         with the trees and foliage.  The Hunter walks down a
         CORRIDOR of SOLID LIGHT, leading to an opening to the
         jungle.  As the Hunter reaches the doorway he changes
         from visible to invisible, moving on into the night.



 113     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT                              113

         The mist has thickened, the night alive with a million
         JUNGLE SOUNDS.  The team members sleep uneasily, if at
         all.

         Mac, although weary, stares hard into the night,
         waiting, each small sound a potential enemy.  A LULL
         spreads over the jungle, animals and insects QUIETING.
         Mac tightens his grip on the Mini-gun.

         Billy awakens, peering into the night.  Nothing.

         Suddenly, a metallic CLICK, a POP, the SOUND of a
         warning flare rocketing into the canopy.  A moment later
         a brilliant FLASH as the flare burns, illuminating the
         camp.

         An echoing eerie SCREAM fills the night as a DARK SHAPE
         in the mist rockets through the undergrowth towards Mac.

         Mac spins, hauling the heavy gun around, just as
         something crashes into his upper body, driving the huge
         man into the foxhole.

         A desperate battle for life ensues, illuminated with
         the strobing light of the descending flare.  Mac's
         enraged SHOUTS and ROARS mingled with horrific SCREAMS
         fill the night.

         Mac's razor-edged KNIFE slashes in the light; BLOOD
         spatters his face as he attacks fiercely.

 113     CONTINUED:                                           113 

         Schaefer and Ramirez rush at a crouching run towards
         the foxhole, their weapons ready.

         A tremendous climatic SCREAM from the foxhole AND THEN,
         SILENCE.  Schaefer and Ramirez approach, cautiously.
         Mac stands, his face and clothes drenched in blood,
         some of it his, his breath coming in rapid gasps.  He
         looks at Schaefer, whispering hoarsely.

                                 MAC
                  Got the motherfucker...

         As the flare breaks through the canopy, dying out in
         great flickering bursts, the man stare down into the
         foxhole.  A huge, jungle BOAR lies mutilated in a pool
         of blood, still quivering in the final throes of death.

         The flare dies out.

         Mac, shaking from adrenalin, breathing heavily, looks
         down at the dying animal.

                                 MAC

         Schaefer shines his TEKNA-LIGHT onto the boar, playing
         the light along its massive hulk, its razor edges tusks
         gleaming in the light.  Ramirez appears by his side,
         looking down at the huge carcass.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Holy shit, Mac.

         Nearby, unnoticed by the men, Anna stoops, her hands
         still bound, picking up an MP-5 from the ground.  She
         turns, looking for an avenue of escape, running for
         the jungle.

         But the forest looks foreboding and sinister.  She
         stops, staring at the jungle, the moonlight reflected
         off leaves like a thousand eyes.  For a brief second
         she imagines she can see the Hunter's eyes, crashing
         towards her, the shifting patterns of light and dark
         making the jungle seem to strobe, like it is about to
         rush in at her.  She freezes, paralyzed by fear, by her
         memories of the attack.

         She drops the MP-5 to the ground.

         Back at the foxhole, Schaefer and Ramirez help the
         still shaken Mac from the hole.  Schaefer looks at
         Mac, at the huge gash across his chest.

                  Get a field dressing on that
                  right away.

         Suddenly he remembers, Anna.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Where's the girl?

         They all turn, ready to move and then stop.  Coming
         forth from the shadows Anna appears, still frightened,
         seeking the security of the soldiers.

         From the darkness nearby, Billy's VOICE in a hoarse
         WHISPER.

                                 BILLY
                         (o.s.; urgently)
                  Major, over here.

         Schaefer turns, apprehensive, something in Billy's
         voice...

         He walks over to Billy, standing with a FLASHLIGHT
         pointing to the ground.  They see Blain's BODY BAG
         slashed open, covered in blood.  Ramirez appears.

                                 BILLY
                  The body...it's gone.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  Came in through the trip
                  wires, took it right out from
                  under our noses...

         Anna appears between Schaefer and Ramirez, staring down
         at the empty, blood-soaked body bag.  She looks up, into
         Schaefer's eyes.



 114     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY (PRE-DAWN)                      114

         A patchy GROUND FOG covers the area.  Anna, in her
         foxhole, awakens, LISTENING to the rising SOUNDS of
         the jungle.  MONKEYS begin to forage, their noisy
         CHATTERING and SCREECHING filling the air.

         A BIRD flutters back to its nest; a CHAMELEON emerges
         onto a leaf, directly above Anna's head.

         Anna carefully extends her arm, allowing the lizard
         to crawl onto her, watching, fascinated as it changes
         colors.  She carefully places the chameleon back on the
         leaf, which changes color again, becoming nearly
         invisible.

         Near the empty PONCHO, Schaefer, Billy and Ramirez
         are examining the ground and the trip wire to the
         flare.  Billy stands, turns to Schaefer.

                                 BILLY
                  Boar set off the trip flare,
                  Major.  No other tracks.

         Schaefer kneels and examines the thin, well hidden
         WIRE.  He stands, looking around the camp.

                                 RAMIREZ
                  How could anyone get through

                  Why didn't he try to kill one
                  of us last night?

         Schaefer looks at him.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  He came back for the body.

                  He's killing us, one at a
                  time...

         Schaefer turns and looks at Billy, asking with his
         eyes for a viable explanation.

                                 BILLY
                  Like a Hunter.                                     *

         Schaefer stares at him, the words sinking in.  He           *
         looks up, reconstructing in his mind the possible           *
         events of last night, his eyes following the tree line,     *
         tracing the path of the intruder as he might have           *
         travelled through the trees and down to the ground.         *
         He looks up at Billy.

         Billy and Ramirez stare up at the trees, a wave of fear     *
         passing through them...from the trees.  Schaefer turns,     *
         moving to where Dillon is guarding Anna, sitting on the
         ground.  Reaching down, Schaefer pulls her firmly to her
         feet, looking at her intensely.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Yesterday.  What did you see?

         She looks at him a long moment, and then answers in
         English.

                  I don't know what it was.
                  It...

         Dillon does a double take.  Schaefer continues to look      *
         at Anna.  He wasn't surprised:  he knew it yesterday.       *

                                 SCHAEFER

         Anna at the base of the rocks scans the jungle with
         binoculars watching the tree line.  Mac moves past her,
         uncoiling a trip wire linking up four CLAYMORE mines
         hidden at various points with leaves and foliage.  In
         a tree at the edge of the clearing, Billy tosses an
         uncoiling roll of wire to Ramirez who attaches it to
         a GRENADE, wedged it the crouch of a tree.

         Wires attached to GRENADES and CLAYMORE MINES lead off
         through the underbrush and trees leaving a long, unmined
         corridor leading from the camp and into the jungle.


         At the corridor's end, where the rocks merge with
         the jungle, Schaefer hauls down on a HEAVY VINE,
         straining with every ounce of strength, his muscles

         gigantic bow with every pull, CREAKING and GROANING
         with tension.  With a last mighty heave, Schaefer draws
         the tree almost within reach, gesturing to Dillon to        *

         Ignoring him, Schaefer rapidly drags into position a
         NET crudely woven of differing sizes of vines, their
         LEAVES still attached.  He carefully begins to cover
         the net with leaves and debris.  Dillon watches him
         in growing frustration as Schaefer moves quickly,
         picking up a FRAMEWORK of STICKS he has tied together,
         a TREADLE-SPRING TRIGGER.  He holds up the framework,
         hurriedly examining his work before placing it on

         Morning passes.  Fog lifts as the sun creeps into the jungle.
         Insects swarm and are fed upon by BIRDS and other predators.

         At the entranceway to the rock outcropping, the net and trigger
         are hidden beneath the leaves, the framework of the trigger
         bulging with tension from the straining vine attached to the
         bent tree.

         At the other end of the corridor, several meters above the
         jungle floor, Schaefer and his team, heavily camouflaged,
         nearly invisible, lie hidden, waiting.  The team members, as
         if hypnotized by the BUZZING din, stare into the jungle,
         fixated, alert.

         ANNA while waiting at the net:

                                  ANNA
                         (hushed)
                  When I was little we find a man --
                         (she struggles for
                         the words)
                  -- like a butcher.  The old ones in
                  the village cross themselves and
                  whisper crazy things.  'Demonio,
                  cazador de trofoes...Only the hottest
                  times of the hottest years...'  Crazy
                  things...This year is grows hot.  And
                  we begin finding our men.  We find
                  them sometimes without their skin.
                  Sometimes...much, much worse.  Cazador
                  de trofoes...means the demon who takes
                  trophies.

         SLOW RACK TO Schaefer's face.  Ashen.  HOLD.  Suddenly an
         EERIE SILENCE moves over the jungle:

         He whips his face forward.  The silence is SHATTERED by a
         bird flapping from the brush.

         Schaefer sits back and scratches his head, frustrated and a
         little chagrined.

                                 DILLON
                         (o.s.)
                  What'll you try next -- cheese?

         Schaefer glares at him.  Turns to go --

         He stands and begins to move low to the ground toward the
         waiting snare.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

         REVISED - "THE HUNTER" - 1/27/87                      72-A

         Behind him, sighting down their well-hidden gun barrels, the
         others scan the jungle, alert for the slightest sound or
         movement, covering him.

         Schaefer reaches the trap, carefully skirting the trigger
         hidden beneath the leaves.  He reaches the end of the corridor,
         moving out into the jungle.  He moves further away from the
         others, the silence crushing down on him.  He stops and waits,
         sweat pouring down his face, his finger tightening on the
         trigger of his M-203, eyes scanning the jungle.

         He turns his back on the jungle, waiting.  Nothing.  He moves
         back towards the corridor, reaching the net, again waiting,
         listening, sensing.  Nothing.  He turns around, looking at the
         jungle one last time, his face measuring defeat and then, with
         carefully, measured strides, he walks back to the camp.

         Schaefer looks at Billy who shakes his head in puzzlement.
         Nearby, Dillon starts to rise.

                                 DILLON
                         (low; whispered)
                  Satisfied?  Now let's get the hell

 116     CONTINUED:                                           116

         Suddenly, behind Schaefer at the end of the corridor,
         with a resounding SWISH and SNAP, the NET explodes off
         the floor of the jungle in a hail of leaves and sticks,
         rocketing upward into the treetops.

         Schaefer spins, the others leaping to their feet as
         they SEE the net as it tears into the treetops, a
         large struggling bulge trapped within as a long,
         unearthly TRILLING SCREAM ECHOES through the jungle.

         Schaefer and the others charge from the rocks towards
         the jungle and the bobbing net, their weapons ready.
         Anna remains behind, watching terrified from the rocks.

         They arrive under the net, raising their weapons to
         fire...but before they can fire the entire net
         EXPLODES into a flurry of leaves, twigs, vines, dirt
         and a FLASH of PULSATING CRIMSON.



 117     EXT. HUNTER'S HAND AND ARM - DAY                     117

         As the Hunter leaps from the net his WEAPON activates,
         his arm slashing out, severing a THICK LIMB of the
         spreading tree capony, entangled in vines.



 118     EXT. THE TEAM - DAY                                  118

         The limb CRASHES down from the trees, Schaefer, Dillon,
         Billy and Mac Diving for safety.  But Ramirez, following
         the Hunter's leap, SEES too late the pendular movement
         of the severed limb and is struck a THUDDING blow in
         the ribs, which lifts him off his feet, hurling him
         backwards like a rag doll, his shirt torn open,
         exposing a BLOODY WOUND.

         As Anna runs to Ramirez's side the others, still
         stunned, look upward, frozen in shock SEEING:  THE
         HUNTER, clinging to a side of a tree, flushed bright
         crimson.

         Dillis is dumbfounded, like the others, rooted to the
         ground staring upward.

                                 DILLON
                  What is God's name...?

         The Hunter utters an unearthly SNARL and HISS from his
         open mouth as an instant later his camouflage resumes
         and he vanishes from sight...a rapid, furtive movement
         through the trees.

         Mac OPENS FIRE with the M-60, the others joining in,
         shredding the foliage, but they know the creature is
         gone.

         With a SHOUT, Mac races into the jungle, in pursuit
         of the Hunter.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Mac!

         Schaefer hurriedly ejects the spent clip from the M-203,
         slamming in a new one.  He shouts an order to Billy.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Billy)
                  Get Ramirez on his feet!  Take
                  the girl and get the hell out
                  of here!

         He turns to run after Mac.  Dillon steps in front of
         him, putting his hand on Schaefer's chest.

                                 DILLON
                  No way, Dutch.  I'm going.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  This isn't your style, Dillon.

                                 DILLON
                  Guess I've picked up some bad

                  I'm right.  Get to that
                  chopper and hold it for us.
                  We'll be along.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You know you can't win this
                  one.

         Dillon stares at him.

                  You know me, Dutch, I never
                  did know when to quit.

         Dillon turns and begins to move out.

                  Dillon!

         Dillon turns.  Picking up the spare MP-5, Schaefer
         tosses the weapon to Dillon, who grabs it with one
         hand.  They share a look, knowing this is farewell.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  I'll see you there.

                                 DILLON
                  Right behind you.

         Hefting both weapons at the hip he runs into the jungle
         after Mac.  Schaefer watches him leave.  He breaks and
         goes to Ramirez, attended by Anna and Billy, who is now
         sitting up, holding his ribs and gasping for breath.

                                 BILLY
                  He's busted up, bad, Major.

         Creeping low to the ground, his eyes searching through
         the trees.

         Moving through the underbrush HEARS a slight RUSTLING
         in the foliage.  Mac?  He strains to locate the source
         of the movement.

         He HEARS A SOUND, too faint at first it identify.  He
         listens.  Silence.  He hears is again, the SOUND of
         a VOICE, barely audible.  A VERY QUIET WHISPER.

         Dillon locates the direction of the voice and moves

                  Dillon, over here.

         Dillon moves a few feet into the undergrowth.  He
         carefully parts the thick leaves and vines and enters
         a tiny opening.  He looks around, seeing nothing.

         Suddenly a HAND appears and covers Dillon's mouth.
         Dillon gasps as Mac pulls him down to where he is
         hiding.

                  can you see it?

         Something seems to MOVE in the direction Mac is pointing.

         Dillon points to an OUTCROPPING OF ROCKS, covered with
         VINES.

         Dillon silently disappears into the jungle, Mac
         watching him go.

         Mac makes his way toward the rock outcropping, working
         his way between the rocks and the vines.  He takes up
         a position and scans the jungle before him.

         stops and listens.

         He reaches out and grabs a VINE and carefully pulls
         himself forward into a better position.

 124     MAC/ROCK OUTCROPPING                                 124

         There is MOVEMENT in the undergrowth.  He begins to
         sweat.  He moves the safety to fire; reaches out and
         grabs another vine to pull himself forward.  Mac
         reacts in shock.

         The vine is alive!  Before he can move, the Hunter's
         HAND appears from the vines, grabbing Mac by the
         wrist.

         In the moment before he is killed, Mac turns and SEES
         the Hunter's glowing EYES.

         A FLASH as the Hunter's other hand, moves with
         blinding speed, Mac's face contorting in pain as the
         Hunter's razor-sharp SPUR rips deep into his throat.
         He falls forward into the leaves.

         He HEARS the faint disturbance in the leaves.  He
         pauses, turning in Mac's direction, listening.
         Hearing no further sound he relaxes, moving on.

         Anna in the lead, followed by Schaefer carrying Ramirez
         on his back.  Billy, carrying the RADIO is covering
         them from above, as they skitter and slide down the
         loose gravel of a rocky slope, leading to a river
         crossing.

         He stalks through a narrow corridor of tangled vines
         and moss, leading to the rock outcropping on the other
         side, his face alert, showing no signs of fear, his
         weapon ready.



 128     EXT. VINES AND MOSS - DETAIL - DAY                   128

         Through the thick tangle of undergrowth, there is
         MOVEMENT, a slight, undulating distortion, drifting
         through the hanging vegetation, as if cast by a
         passing shadow.

         Did he hear something?  He moves on.

         Behind Dillon and to the side of the corridor.  The
         Hunter syncopates him movements precisely with those
         of Dillon.

         Dillon stops.  The Hunter freezes in position.



 131     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 131

         He does sense something behind him.  He crouches and
         spins, leveling the weapon.  The corridor behind him
         is empty, quiet and undisturbed.  He studies the trail
         intently.



 132     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           132

         Peering out through the vines.  Dillon is looking
         directly at him.  Dillon turns, moves on, as the
         Hunter resumes his stalk, timing his movements
         perfectly with those of Dillon.



 133     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 133

         as he approaches the rock outcropping.  He signals.
         Receiving no response he moves closer, turning
         cautiously to right and left.

                         (whispering)
                  Mac...Mac.

         He moves closer to the rocks, eyes probing.  Through a
         gap in the rocks he SEES Mac's face, staring up at him,
         eyes frozen wide in death.

         Dillon spins hard.  He stares at the solid wall of
         undergrowth.  He looks from one side of the corridor
         to the other.  Something it out there.  Where?

         Something in the vines has caught his attention.  He
         stares hard at a section of moss.



 134     EXT. MOSS - DETAIL - DAY                             134

         Suddenly the right combination of light and shadow
         prevail and Dillon SEES in an instant, the Hunter's
         EYES materialize and then disappear.



 135     BACK TO SCENE/DILLON                                 135

         With a growl and exhalation of breath, charges,
         bringing the weapon to bear.  A short BURST OF GUNFIRE
         erupts from the barrel.



 136     EXT. THE HUNTER - DAY                                136

         In an indiscernible blue of camouflage releases his
         weapon.



 137     DILLON                                               137

         SCREAMS, his arm instantly severed halfway between
         his shoulder and elbow.  The weapon drops to the
         ground, the forearm still attached, still FIRING.

         With his left hand he FIRES the second weapon
         SHOUTING INSANELY as swings it towards the blurred
         image of his unseen attacker, hitting nothing.

         The Hunter reloads his WEAPON which turns INVISIBLE
         again.  Dillon continues to fire.  The Hunter's
         weapon appears from below, cutting into Dillon's
         unprotected abdomen, which, as if hit by a samurai
         sword, bursts open.  Dillon CRIES OUT as the huge man
         hits the ground.



 138     EXT. LOG CROSSING - DAY                              138

         spanning the narrow gorge, Schaefer and Anna with
         Ramirez between them, move onto the log, preparing
         to cross.  They stop, HEARING Dillon's GUNFIRE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               80



 139     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           139

         Moving through the jungle with incredible speed,
         leaping, tearing from tree to tree, the jungle a rush
         of HEAT TRAILS as he charges on.



 140     EXT. LOG CROSSING - DAY                              140

         The jungle is still deathly SILENT.  Schaefer, Anna
         and Ramirez cross the log, moving onto the other side.
         Billy, still at the foot of the log, providing cover,
         turns to face the jungle.

         He lifts his head towards the trees, feeling the
         onrushing presence of the Hunter.  He shrugs off the
         radio letting it fall, smashing into the rocks
         below.

         He casts away his weapon.  Staring forward he reaches
         into his cargo pocket, withdrawing a small
         GREASE-PAINT TIN.  Covering his finger in BLACK
         PAINT he applies dark slashes under his eyes and
         again, vertically down his cheeks.  Taking another
         dap of paint he makes a SYMBOL on his bare skin, over
         his heart.

         He drops the tin, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE.  Holding
         the knife he grasps the MEDICINE BAG around his neck,
         yanking it free with a quick snap.  He wraps the
         leather thong around his hand and knife, binding the
         weapon and bag together.

         Staring outward, as if in a trance, he begins a low
         CHANT.

         On the other side, Schaefer carrying Ramirez on his
         back, laboring up the steep slope, nearing the top,
         turns and SEES Billy standing, waiting at the foot of
         the bridge.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (screaming)
                  Billy!!!

         But Billy stands at the foot of the bridge, knife
         raised, waiting, accepting his oncoming destiny.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Billy!!!

         In frustration, Schaefer hikes Ramirez higher onto his
         back, digs in and sprints to the top of the hill, Anna
         waiting at the top.

 145     EXT. RIDGETOP - DAY                                  145

         Over the top, in a low depression, Schaefer props
         Ramirez against some rocks, reaching for his weapon.
         They HEAR Billy's echoing SCREAM.  Instantly their
         weapons are raised, cocked and ready.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Get back, into the rocks!

         Schaefer sweeps Anna behind him as Ramirez struggles
         to his feet.  Together they back up, covering the
         ridgeline over which they've just come.

         Suddenly, from one side, near Ramirez, the Hunter
         bursts from the jungle, Ramirez, seeing the Hunter,
         spins raising his weapons to fire...

         Ramirez SEES the Hunter's onrushing face, still in
         camouflage, a montage of organic textures and colors,
         his yellow eyes burning.

         Whipping the MP-5 is the direction of the Hunter
         he is hurled backwards from the impact of the Hunter's
         weapon, his neck gushing BLOOD, the MP-5 flying
         through the air, landing in front of Anna.  She moves
         for the weapon...

         The Hunter, with unearthly speed, turns towards
         Anna, as Schaefer starts to spin, SEEING the Hunter
         about to strike as Anna dives for the weapon.
         Schaefer lunges kicking the MP-5 out of Anna's reach.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (to Anna)

         Schaefer spins and FIRES, bullets THUDDING into the
         ground, the barrel arcing towards the Hunter as Anna
         stumbles to her feet running into the jungle.

         In a blur the Hunter spins back, hurling his weapon at
         Schaefer which slices through the wooden stock of the
         rifle, SPARKS FLYING as it severs the trigger guard
         and steel breech.

         The M-203 flies out of Schaefer's hands as the Hunter's
         weapon cuts deeply into his left shoulder, laying open
         the flesh.

         The M-203 hits the ground, where it lies broken in half,
         useless.

         Schaefer hits the ground and is rolling, up and running
         for his life, the Hunter charging after him.



 146     SCHAEFER                                             146

         crashes headlong through the jungle.  He leaps a fallen
         log, stumbles, struggles to his feet, running on pure
         adrenalin, his shoulder pulsing blood, his eyes filled
         with terror.

         Behind him he can hear the Hunter in pursuit, closing.

         Schaefer spins to look behind him, a wild desperate
         look on his face; he turns back, ducks an overhanging
         limb and lunges on.



 147     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. OF SCHAEFER - DAY               147

         Closing rapidly...another few yard.



 148     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               148

         runs like a madman, the SOUND of the Hunter's FOOTSTEPS
         close behind.  He's losing ground.  He knows he's going
         to die.

         Schaefer SHOUTS.  Suddenly the ground before him
         COLLAPSES and he disappears from sight.



 149     EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY                               149

         In a shower of leaves, flailing arms and legs, Schaefer
         crashes through the trees at the canyon's edge, free
         falling into space.

 149     CONTINUED:                                           149 

         With a sickening IMPACT, he hits the branches of the
         first trees lining the canyon and falls, a hundred feet,
         through one canopy after another, desperately grabbing
         for limbs and branched to break his fall.

         He hits the bottom branches of the list line of trees,
         impacting crosschest on a large BRANCH, knocking his
         wind out.

         Semi-conscious, he hangs momentarily before he slides
         off, fingers digging into the bark, falling another ten
         feet into the swiftly moving river.



 150     EXT. RIVER - DAY                                     150 

         Weighted down by his boots and clothing, Schaefer
         struggles to stay afloat.  Gasping for air he ducks
         underwater, untying one of his boots.  He surfaces,
         fills his lungs and dives again, releasing the other
         boot.  He surfaces, strips off his shirt and pants and
         begins to swim towards shore, stroking with one arm.



 151     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           151 

         As he nears the edge of the precipice from which
         Schaefer has fallen.  The Hunter in close pursuit does
         not hesitate but LAUNCHES himself off the cliff in
         a spectacular LEAP, streaking downward towards the tops
         of the trees that grow out from the canyon wall.

         The Hunter tears through the canopy of the first tree,
         the branches and leaves rushing past in a KALEIDOSCOPIC
         BLUR.

         The Hunter bounds off of one branch after another,
         moving through the trees as an expert skier might
         negotiate a series of downhill gates.

         The Hunter leaps free of one tree, bounds across twenty
         feet of open space to a large branch of a huge tree,
         affording a good view of the river below.  From his
         vantage point, looking down at the windening, slowing
         expanse of river, Schaefer is nowhere to be seen.



 152     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  152

         He is swept into a still FASTER CURRENT and is carried
         helplessly downstream.  Boiling WHITEWATER appears.

 152     CONTINUED:                                           152

         Out of control he is swept through a series of rapids,
         pulling his further and further downstream until he is
         finally ducked into the undertow and hurled over the
         top of a six foot falls, driven deep underwater by the
         pounding force of the water.



 153     EXT. POOL AT BASE OF FALLS - DAY                     153

         There is no sign of Schaefer.  Precious seconds pass.
         Slowly, looking like a drowned rat, he surfaces, taking
         a feeble breath.  He is nearly finished, his energy
         sapped.  But the water is calm and a few strokes are
         enough to carry him near the shore.  His feet hit
         bottom.

         He tries to stand but pitches headfirst into the thick
         MUD SLURRY at the river bank.  With his last ounce of
         strength, he crawls, panting and gasping into a
         sheltered mud OVERHANG, collapsing beside the exposed
         ROOT-SYSTEM OF A DEAD TREE, his body completely covered
         in thick, gray MUD.

         Nearly unconscious, he raises his head and looks to the
         opposite side of the river, scanning the bank.  There is
         no sign of the Hunter.  He collapses in relief.  He's
         escaped.

         Suddenly, the Hunter impacts the water, throwing up a
         huge SPLASH.  He stands up in the waist deep water.  As
         the water streams off of his body, the chameleon effect
         rapidly changes, struggling to match the shifting color
         patterns of the shimmering water.

         His glaring yellow orbs stare directly at the spot where
         Schaefer lies helplessly trapped.

         The Hunter surges forward, relentlessly closing in on
         this prey.



 154     SCHAEFER                                             154 

         is frozen in terror, paralyzed with fear, his eyes
         locked ontothe incredible creature that is about to
         kill him.



 155     EXT. HUNTER - DAY                                    155

         Closing rapidly, another ten feet.  He leaves the water
         and walks through the mud, stopping, towering over
         Schaefer.

         three feet away.



 157     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  157

         Realizing his life is about to end, closes his eyes,
         awaiting the Hunter's killing blow.



 158     EXT. HUNTER'S EYES - DAY                             158

 159     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           159

         He's looking directly at Schaefer, EXCEPT HE CAN'T
         SEE HIM.

         He can clearly see the EXPOSED ROOT-SYSTEM, but because
         of the heavy mud blocking Schaefer's body heat, Schaefer
         registers in the Hunter's vision as merely an indistinct
         lump of clay, unrecognizable to the Hunter as a human
         being.

         He scans the bank, searching, looking for heat sources.

         Detecting none he moves on sounding a questioning TRILL
         several times.



 160     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               160

         disbelieving that he's still alive, opens one eye,
         SEEING the Hunter's feet move away, his prehensile
         spurs dragging in the mud.  He rounds a bend and
         disappears, heading for the undergrowth.

         Astonished, he tries to raise up on his hands but a
         sudden jabbing pain in his shoulder causes him to
         collapse, falling onto his side, unconscious in the
         mud.



 161     EXT. RIVER - DAY                                     161

         As a HUEY ATTACK HELICOPTER breaks over the top of the
         ridge, diving forward, moving down the canyon.  The
         chopper flares up into a holding pattern.

         In the open doorway, a SOLDIER searches the top of
         the canyon with binoculars.  Seeing no sign of life,
         the chopper flies on, disappearing down the canyon
         rim.



 162     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               162

         lies unconscious in the mud, the distant SOUND of the
         helicopter THRUMPING into the distance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

         She runs into a clearing, stopping momentarily, gasping
         for breath.  She is startled by a sudden movement
         behind her.  She spins, looking.  There is nothing
         there.  She runs on.



 164     EXT. THE CANYON - DAY (DUSK)                         164

         Schaefer GASPS as his eyes bolt open in fear.  As if
         the Hunter were still attacking, Schaefer rolls to his
         feet and runs, slogging through the THICK MUD, stumbling,
         lunging forward, gasping for breath.

         Schaefer spins and staggers backwards into a shallow
         POOL, scuttling, crablike into the chest deep water.
         Schaefer backs into the moss-covered wall by the
         waterfall, looking for movement, regaining his senses.

         As the water settles, he looks down, SEEING the image
         of himself, reflected in the pool; his hair and face
         covered in THICK CLAY.  He stares, mesmerized at the
         image.

         He lifts his arm from the water, his fingers wiping the
         MUD from his face, exposing a PATCH of SKIN.  He studies
         the mud in his hand and then looks at the image of
         himself in the water, SEEING the exposed skin.  HE
         stares at it, a wave of realization rushing through
         his mind.  He places the mud back on his face, again
         looking at his image.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  You couldn't see me.

         He looks up, out into the failing light, at the treeline
         of the deepening forest, realizing that fate has given
         him a fighting chance.  Slowly a look of vengeance and
         hatred crosses over his face.



 165     EXT. CLAY BANK - NIGHT                               165

         Using his MACHETE he carves MAGNESIUM SHAVINGS from a
         fire block into a pile of KINDLING.  He removes a match
         from the hollow handle of the machete, also containing
         a coil of PIANO WIRE, GREEN TAPE and MEDICAL SUPPLIES.
         He lights the shavings which burn with a brilliant white
         light.  Schaefer shelters the fire with a banana leaf
         until the flame dies down.  He feeds the fire with more
         kindling, fanning it with a leaf.



 165-A   SCHAEFER - BOW AND ARROW MONTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)     166

         Holding a three foot section of FIRE-HARDENED sapling
         between his feet and shoulder, he scrapes the char
         from the seasoned wood with his machete.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

         He bends the bow and attaches a long piece of PIANO
         WIRE to one end, carefully wrapping it for strength,
         using strips of green tape to cover the sides of the
         wire where the nock of the arrow will fit.

         He attaches split quilled FEATHERS with fishing line to
         an ARROW,  its tip fashioned into a series of barbs,
         rubbing them to a polished hardness against a smooth
         stone.  When finished he places the arrow on the ground
         next to three other identical arrows.


                                 SCHAEFER
                  One chance, that's all.



 166     EXT. CLAY BANK - NIGHT                               166 
 

         Schaefer is pounding a peeled root between two stones.
         He pauses to drool saliva into the pulpy mass.  He
         scrapes the milky substance onto a BANANA LEAF, mixing
         it with a sticky SAP, holding it over the coals until
         the mixture steams.

         Schaefer coats the arrow tips with the sticky poison,
         holding them over the coals until the sap bubbles and
         smokes.  He spins the arrows in his hands, blowing on
         the tips to cool and harden the mixture.

         Using the tip of his machete, he pries open the casing
         of one of the 40MM grenades, discarding the warhead.  He
         dumps the PROPELLANT POWDER from the shell onto a leaf,
         mixing that with a mound of MAGNESIUM SHAVINGS.

         He opens the narrow, tight roll of GAUZE taken from the
         first aid kit of the machete handle, fluffing it into a
         large, loose BUNDLE, the size of a baseball.  He pours
         the powder-mixture into the gauze, mixing it into the
         fabric.

         He transfers the ball of explosive ladened gauze to a
         pliable DRY LEAF, closing it into a bundle, binding it
         at the top with a long strand of jungle-grass.

         He twists the remaining gauze around a MATCH, leaving
         the head exposed, forming a self-striking FUSE.

         He coats the fuse with SAP and then thickly covers it
         with more powder from the 40MM grenade.  He pokes the
         fuse down into the leaf.  Taking a long strand of JUNGLE
         GRASS he makes a large loop, tying it onto the grenade,
         slipping the loop and grenade over his head.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 166     CONTINUED:                                           166 

         Finally, using several sections of BAMBOO of differing
         diameters, he fashions a crude, anti-personnel
         SPEAR-BOMB, a BANG-STICK like weapon, using the
         sharpened TONGUE from his belt buckle for a FIRING PIN
         and a 40MM GRENADE from his belt pouch as an explosive
         charge.



 167     EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - NIGHT                            167

         Schaefer appears, he has covered him entire body with a
         variety of CLAYS and OCHERS, creating a mottled, EARTHEN
         CAMOUFLAGE pattern.

         Holding his weapons in one hand, he moves up the canyon,
         ascending into a rising boulder field.



 167-A   EXT. BOULDER FIELD - NIGHT                           167-A

         Where the river flows into a series of falls and pools,
         surrounded by massive boulders and table top rocks,
         their crevices jammed with large amounts of DRIFTWOOD
         swept down at high water from the forests above.

         On a flattened section of rock, Schaefer drags a large
         section of BRANCHES INTO VIEW, adding it to a growing
         mound of FIREWOOD.  He kneels, tending to a pile of
         DRIES GRASS, LEAVES and other tinder.  Using the last of
         his precious matches, he sets fire to the tinder, gently
         coaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consumming FIRE,
         flames starting to lick upward through the dry wood.

         He stands, staring into the rapidly growing blaze.  He
         turns, facing the canyon rim, raising his weapons in one
         hand.  From the depths of his soul, a SOUND emerges;
         primitive and visceral, as if from an animal in pain.

         He throws back his head and SHOUTS.



 168     EXT. CANYON RIM - NIGHT                              168

         A hundred feet below, Schaefer stands in the boulder
         field, his mud coated body bathed in RED FIRELIGHT,
         looking like a fierce, primitive warrior; a timeless,
         prehistoric sight, his long and WAILING CRY, ECHOING
         endlessly through the canyon.



 169     EXT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           169

         Backlit by the LIGHT of the open door, the Hunter's
         head, in three-quarter profile, his eyes gleaming, rears
         INTO VIEW, looking up at the sky, HEARING Schaefer's cry.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 169     CONTINUED:                                           169 

         Responding with a low HISS, he turns back, raising in
         one hand his weapon, in the other a U-shaped SHARPENING
         DEVICE.  As he passes the weapon through the device, it
         FLASHES into life, a deep, HARMONIC HUM emitted as the
         blade grows with energy, growing hotter, hotter and
         HOTTER with each stroke.  He draws the blade now WHITE-HOT
         through the device for the last stroke.  He lifts
         it, testing its balance, the WHITE-HOT blade
         illuminating his alien face.

 178     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - JUNGLE - NIGHT                178 

         Emerging from his camp, the Hunter swings into the
         nearby tree line, moving to the uppermost branches.
         The Hunter travels silently from tree to tree, arriving
         at the canyon rim where far below he SEES in the
         canyon, the BONFIRE, a leaping, shifting, multi-colored
         collage of HEAT WAVES and FLARES, luring him onward.



 179     SCHAEFER                                             179 
 
         hidden back within the deep notch of several large
         LOGS and broken trees, in the river canyon.  Below
         him, on the rock plateau, is the bonfire, illuminating
         in SHIFTING PATTERNS of LIGHT, the awaiting arena of
         destiny.

         His eyes shift, trancelike, moving from side to side,
         watching the approaches to the fire below.  His senses
         are alert; his nerves on a wire edge.



 180     EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  180 

         His SHADOW-FORM descending through the canyon, a
         rippling movement of grays and blacks, passing through
         the shifting light patterns on the rocks, cast by the
         growing bonfire below.



 181     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - NIGHT                         181 

         His eyes probe the canyon, drawn to the swirling
         patterns of HEAT given off by the gaseous COMBUSTION
         of the bonfire.



 182     EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  182 

         Continues on, moving silently down through the canyon.

 183     SCHAEFER                                             183 

         sits motionless, nearly invisible in his mud camouflage
         amid the darkness of the logs.

         Suddenly, over the CRACKLING of the FIRE, the BUZZING,
         CLICKING of INSECTS, and the CROAKING of FROGS, suddenly
         CEASES.

         Slowly, painfully he draws the bow to full arch, his
         wounded shoulder trembling, the BLOOD beginning to seep
         through the bandage.

         The bow straining at full draw, Schaefer stares intently,
         concentrating, searching for the Hunter's form in the
         dancing light below.



 183-A   EXT. THE HUNTER - NIGHT                              183-A

         Like a giant insect, drops from above, fifteen feet
         above Schaefer, his steel-like spurs digging deep into
         the log.



 183-B   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                183-B

         He freezes at the sound of the Hunter dropping, his
         eyes wide with fear.  The slightest movement will bring
         an instant attack from the Hunter behind him.  But to
         wait, his back exposed.



 183-C   EXT. THE HUNTER - NIGHT                              183-C

         Jumps from the log above and to Schaefer's left, onto
         a boulder, gaining a better vantage point of the arena
         and fire below.  He raises his weapon, his EYES
         glistening in the dim light, searching.  A quiet HISS
         emerges from his mouth.



 183-D   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                183-D

         Spins and fires at the movement of the Hunter.



 184     EXT. ARROW - NIGHT                                   184

         Flies into the night, lodging into a BRANCH of an
         exposed tree, just missing the Hunter's head.

         In a blur, the Hunter's arm streaks downward, a dull
         flash of light leaving his fingers as he fires the
         weapon, the projectile STREAKING downward, EXPLODING
         into the log, inches from Schaefer, sending a SHOWER
         of wood chips and bark, flying in every direction.
   
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               91



 185     SCHAEFER                                             185

         in a flash, is up and running, clutching his weapons,
         leaping from boulder to boulder.  He jumps down into the
         lighted area below, landing hard, rolling into the
         protective shadows of the rocks, putting the loping fire
         between he and the Hunter's position on the rocks above.

         He moves forward, darting to look backwards before
         leaping off the lip of the table rock into the boulder
         field below, a flat plane littered by weirdly shaped,
         water-erroded rocks, forming a giant stone AMPITHEATER.
         Shadows leap and dance across the boulders, cast by the
         bonfire from the plateau above.

         Schaefer crouches between two large boulders, quietly
         breathing through clenched teeth, feeling the pain of
         his now freely bleeding shoulder wound.



 185-A   EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  185-A

         A nightmarish silhouette appearing for an instant on the
         rim of the plateau above.



 185-B   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                185-B

         Over the SOUNDS of the FIRE and the softly flowing
         RIVER, distinguishes a NEW SOUND, one that brings fear
         and a savage determination to his heart:  the rhythmical
         CLICK-SCRAPE, CLICK-SCRAPE of the Hunter's feet, moving
         over the rocks, somewhere above him.

         Drawing back on the bow, Schaefer moves around the
         boulder to his left, heading towards the sound of the
         Hunter.

 198     INT. HUNTER. SOMEWHERE IN THE BOULDERS - NIGHT       198

         REVEALED in flashes of strobing light, pauses at the
         juncture of several towering rocks.

         He stands, erect, tilting his head slowly, turning it
         from side to side, his ears trying to orientate to the
         diversity of SOUNDS reflecting off the circular walls,
         enclosing the boulder field.



 199     INT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - NIGHT                         199

         His vision, accustomed to another spectrum, has little
         available heat to register vivid images of the inert,
         lifeless forms of the stones.  He SEES instead, a world
         of soft, ill-defined shapes in a pale MAGENTA field of
         flickering heat.

 200     INT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                200

         Creeping forward, carefully placing one foot in front
         of the other, suddenly stops, hearing the CLICK-SCRAPE,
         CLICK-SCRAPE, now on his right.

         Starting to move in this new direction, he stops again,
         HEARING the sound now directly across from him.
         Listening, he hears the sound again from yet another
         direction, the sound ECHOING in the natural ampitheater
         of rock.

         Schaefer, uncertain of where to turn, waits.  Suddenly
         he crouches and freezes, HEARING the unbelievable SOUND
         of a HUMAN VOICE, softly echoing through the
         ampitheater.

                                 ANNA'S VOICE
                         (o.s.; filtered;
                         in Spanish)
                  Look out, behind you!!!

         Schaefer spins, his breath catching at the sound of
         Anna's voice.  Wide-eyed, straining, he waits, hearing
         only the muted FLOWING of water, the HISSING and POPPING
         of the dying fire above, the shadows growing longer,
         darker with each minute.

         And then again, Anna's VOICE.

                                 ANNA'S VOICE
                         (o.s.; in

                  Anna...?

         Tracelike he moves towards the sound.



 201     THE HUNTER                                           201

         his head canted, throat distended, utters another
         mimicry.



 202     SCHAEFER                                             202

         moving towards the space between two boulders from which
         the VOICE seems to emanate.

         pauses before the opening of the passageway.  All is
         silent.  He hesitates to enter.  Listeneing.  He starts
         to move and then hears a NEW VOICE:

                                 HUNTER

         Schaefer, horrified at the sound of the dead man's
         voice, backs quickly into the space between a boulder
         and the high rock wall of the ampitheater.



 205     INT. HUNTER - SOMEWHERE IN THE BOULDERS - NIGHT      205

         His feet moving quietly over the rock, the shadow-light
         deepening with the dying fire above, closing in.



 205-A   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                205-A

         Bow drawn, trapped against the rock, HEARING the sound
         of the Hunter approaching from the left, now the
         right, is helpless, not knowing where to fire, the
         Hunter's deadly strike only an instant away.

         Still holding the bang-stick in his bow hand, he
         carefully releases the draw on the string, reaching
         to his neck for the FLASH-GRENADE.  With painstaking
         care he removes the grenade from his neck.

         Focusing on the rocks before him and the still
         approaching SOUND, he reaches down with the grenade,
         gripping with his fingertips the matchhead fuse,
         placing it against the rocks at his side.

         With a sudden jerk of his hand he strikes and throws
         the grenade, snatching up the bang-stick with his
         good hand.

 205-A   CONTINUED:                                           205-A

         The matchhead SPUTTERS as the grenade flies through the
         air, an instant later a blinding, WHITE FLASH of light
         illuminates the ampitheater...

         In that instant Schaefer SEES above him and to his left,
         the HUNTER, poised on top of a rock, his weapon raised,
         about to strike!  Momentarily blinded by the flash of
         light, the Hunter's head recoils to the side.

         Darkness swallows the image of the Hunter, but in that
         second, Schaefer seizes his advantage, hurling the
         bang-stick spear.

 214     INT. THE SPEAR - NIGHT                               214

         It smashes into the boulder at the Hunter's feet.  The
         Hunter leaps as the grenade DETONATES, shrapnel tearing
         into his body.

         With a terrifying SCREAM of pain and anger, the Hunter
         clutches frantically at the WOUNDS in his neck and
         chest.  Another bloodcurdling SCREAM OF RAGE and the
         Hunter is gone.



 215     INT. WATERFALL - NIGHT                               215

         Cascades over the rocks, fed by a small stream running
         through the ravine.  A pile of BOULDERS breaks the
         falls, filling the area with an everconstant MIST.

         Schaefer appears, holding the bow and arrow, following
         the LUMINOUS BLOOD TRAIL of the Hunter over the rock.

         Moving behind the falls, Schaefer's body is briefly
         soaked by the water, the hardened and CAMOUFLAGE
         beginning to dissolve, running off his body.  He
         continues on, slowly, cautiously following the blood
         trail.



 216     INT. TABLE TOP BOULDER - NIGHT                       216

         Next to the flowing stream, surrounded by an open area
         of rock.

         Schaefer, smeared with blood and sweat, his clay and
         ochre camouflage partially washed away, climbs up a log
         onto the boulder.  Oblivious to the searing pain in his

         shoulder, he breathes in hot, powerful exchanges, his
         eyes wide and glowing with vengeance.

                                 SCHAEFER
                  Bleed, you bastard.

         His bow down, Schaefer follows the blood trail across
         the rock, edging alongside a huge vertical boulder.
         The blood trail stops.

         He takes another step forward, past a darkened ALCOVE...

         Schaefer spins, SEEING in the alcove the SURPRISED
         Hunter whirl and spring towards him...

         Schaefer in a bound closes the distance, savagely
         kicking the Hunter's arm.  The WEAPON flies from the
         Hunter's hand CLATTERING to the rock.

         Before he can recover, Schaefer follows with a karate
         kick to the chest, hurling the Hunter to the ground,
         his back exposed.

         In a flash, Schaefer is standing over the Hunter, the
         bow drawn, poised, the blood from his open wound
         dripping onto the Hunter's back.

         The Hunter slowly rolls onto his back, REVEALING his
         face, his eyes bleached white in shock from the loss of
         blood.  The Hunter's body, rippled out of control,
         trying desperately to orientate itself to the
         environment.

                                 SCHAEFER
                         (incredulous)
                  Who the hell are you...?



 217     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. OF SCHAEFER - NIGHT             217

         Schaefer's body, looms over him, MOTTLED and STREAKED
         from his exposed skin, blood oozing from the shoulder
         wound, his eyes like black sockets in his almost
         skull-like face.  Seen from this perspective, Schaefer
         is a frightening, horrible visage.



 218     THE HUNTER                                           218

         shudders, GASPING hungrily for air, strugging to speak.
         From his throat, Schaefer HEARS the feeble, distorted
         efforts of the Hunter, at first garbled,
         incomprehensible and then, slowly, chillingly, taking
         on the timbre and quality of his OWN VOICE.

                         (perfect)
                  ...You?

         The Hunter's strength seems to fade even more...

         Then, suddenly, with the last of his diminishing
         strength, he lashes out with one arm, activating the
         lethal, razor sharp SPURS on his wrists.

         The Hunter's coiled leg kicks upward with incredible
         force, his terrible spur ripping into Schaefer's thigh,
         hurling Schaefer into the air, flipping him over,
         sending him crashing to his back into the shallow pool
         of water, momentarily losing his bow.  He flounders
         desperately in the water, searching for the bow.  He
         finds it just as...

         The Hunter rises slowly to his feet, GASPING desperately
         for breath.  He inhales deeply, hungrily, gaining
         strength with each breath.

         Schaefer looks from the pool to SEE the Hunter, raising
         his weapon to throw.

         In one totally instinctual movement, Schaefer draws
         back on the arrow to its very tip and fires.

         The arrow, with a deadly THUD, penetrates deeply into
         the Hunter's neck.  Another bloodcurdling SCREAM of RAGE
         as the Hunter clutches his throat, dropping his weapon.
         An instant later and the Hunter is gone.



 219     EXT. LOG BRIDGE - NIGHT (PRE-DAWN)                   219 

         Emerging onto a huge log leading to the rim of the
         canyon, Schaefer holding the Hunter's weapon, pauses
         several times, finding more traces of the Hunter's
         blood, the deep WOUND in his thigh flowing heavily.
         He continues across the log and climbs the bank,
         following the traces into the jungle.

 220     EXT. JUNGLE - PRE-DAWN                               220 

         Moving along the rim of the coulee, Schaefer follows
         the thick, orange blobs hanging on leaves and spent on
         the forest floor.

         Too weak to move through the trees, the Hunter has
         left a SWATH of trampled grasses, broken twigs and
         branches in his headlong retreat from Schaefer:  the
         Hunter turned Hunted.



 221     EXT. TWO ATTACK HELICOPTERS - DAY (PRE-DAWN)         221

         Powering upward from the canyon, the WATERFALL in the
         b.g., clear the rim, racing along at treetop height,
         heading towards the island promontory.



 222     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - CAMP -PRE-DAWN                222

         Staggering into the clearing, bleeding severely.  The
         Hunter is rapidly losing his camouflage ability, his
         skin turning a PALE GREEN, flexing and pulsing in
         shock.  The glow of light from the ENERGY FIELD
         reflecting off the spreading apron of BLOOD flowing
         from his wound.

         With trembling hands he grasps the arrow and breaks
         it, pulling the shaft from his neck.  He screams in
         pain.



 223     EXT. GLEN - PRE-DAWN                                 223

         Schaefer follows the blood trail, deeper into the
         incredibly dense vegetation, ripping aside the heavy
         growth, plunging onward.

         Before him, covering a narrow passageway, is a huge
         SPIDER WEB, intricate, four feet across.  Schaefer
         starts to sweep aside the web.  With a sharp intake
         of breath, he halts, inches from the wed.  Something
         is wrong.

         Examining the web closer he sees not silken threads
         but a hard and shiny network of HAIR-FINE WIRE: A TRAP.

         He backs up, picking up a hefty branch from the ground.
         He swings the branch with a mighty heave, clenching
         his teeth in pain.  The branch sails end over end
         into the web impacting the strands.  A metallic SNAP
         is HEARD; a high-pitches WHINE and the log is violently
         severed, the pieces flying in opposite directions with
         great speed.

         Schaefer runs on, again picking up the blood traces of
         the fleeing Hunter.



 224     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP                                   224 

         At the edge of the site.  He SEES the Hunter staggering
         through the foliage.

         Schaefer starts after him but then stops, dumbfounded
         by the incredible images that crash in on him:
         TRANSLUCENT HUMAN SKINS stretched over frames, the hair
         of the attached scalps moving lightly in the wind;
         SKINNED BODIES, some lying on the ground, others hung
         from the trees, like Hopper and his men were.

         He turns back, SEEING the Hunter as he passes through
         the shimmering distortion of a FORCEFIELD enveloping
         the forest.  Within the force field he SEES the vague,
         nearly transparent OUTLINE of the Hunter's ship.

         He approaches it, wide-eyed, his senses reeling with
         astonishment and rage.

         From within the force field, a PASSAGE WAY of BLUE LIGHT
         appears, the Hunter's form backlit as he ascends the
         RAMP to his spacecraft.



 225-                                                 OUT     225-

 227     THE HUNTER                                           227

         as he passes his hand through a light BEAM, the ship
         instantly responds, as a low, TURBINELIKE HOWL is
         HEARD, building slowly in volume and pitch.



 228     SCHAEFER                                             228

         in his weakened condition staggers forward, looking
         up, SEEING the passage way of light diminish as the
         door begins to close.

         As rising HEAT WAVES begin to envelope the ship, the
         Hunter stares out at Schaefer, the heat waves
         increasing as the KEENING WHINE of the ship's drive
         builds.  He enters the force field, the door now
         inches from closing.

         On the ground, nearly obscured by the grass and leaves,
         Schaefer SEES the Hunter's WEAPON, lying where he
         dropped it in his desperate flight to escape.

         Schaefer grabs up the weapon and holds it.  How the
         hell does it work?...He squeezes the handle of the
         weapon feeling it resist.  Nothing happens.

         With the last ounce of his strength, and with a BELLOW
         of RAGE, his arm muscles bulging, he crushes down on
         the handle...

         In a FLASH of blue-white light, the weapon becomes
         ACTIVATED.

         Schaefer raises the weapon, sensing its power and
         function.

         In the final seconds before the door closes, Schaefer,
         with a triumphant SCREAM, fires the weapon...

         The weapon, flaring with deadly energy, drops and turns
         sideways, accelerating through the door and into the
         spacecraft.



 229     INT. SPACECRAFT - DAY                                229

         The weapon impacts the Hunter, his head EXPLODING in
         a fountain of orange blood and pale green tissue.

         The weapon continues on, burying itself into the energy
         field, bolts of plasma-energy begin arcing from the
         force field.

         Schaefer falls forward onto his hands and knees,
         staring at the Hunter's ship.  The SOUND of the
         hyper-drive continues to increase, as the ship begins
         to tremble.



 230     EXT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT - DAY                        230

         As suddenly the instrument panel goes wild, gauges
         spinning, digital readouts racing out of control.
         The SOUND of the turbine faltering, changing pitch.
         The pilot lurches forward with the stick, fighting
         for control.



 231     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP - DAY                             231

         The multi harmonic whine of the Hunter's ship is
         still building as the ground begins to shake.

         Schaefer, realizing that the ship is going to explode,
         and ignoring the pain of his shoulder and leg, runs
         desperately, searching for cover.  He sprints for

         just as:

         A blinding purple FLASH blows the ship to pieces.



 232     EXT. HELICOPTER - COCKPIT - DAY                      232

         Enveloped in the flash of intense light.  CRIES of
         surprise fill the ship as the SHOCK-WAVE hits the
         chopper, heeling it hard over to one side.

         Below, the concentric waves of energy race outward
         from the center of the blast, an unearthly sight, like
         the miniature birth of a star.

         The helicopter suddenly regains control, its power
         restored.

                                 PILOT

         The helicopter levels out and heads toward the smoking,
         devastated site of the blast.



 233     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP - DAY                             133

         The jungle has been completely transformed.  No longer
         lush and verdant, the area is clear-cut, two feet
         above the ground, covered in FINE WHITE, smoldering
         ASH.  Amongst the shattered stumps, debris from the
         ship, bright as magnesium flares, burns with exotic
         colors.

         If the f.g., Schaefer, a living dead-man, streaked
         with the alien ash, rises up from a shallow depression,
         staring dumbstruck at the site.

         Breaking in low over the treetops, the HELICOPTERS
         flare up into position, one preparing to land.

         As the chopper descends, the crew, standing in the
         door way, stare transfixed at the devastation, their
         eyes trying to penetrate the dense white smoke.

         As the helicopter slowly descends, its propwash creating
         a raging storm, Schaefer materializes from the SWIRLING
         SMOKE AND ASH, his features taking form as he
         approaches, his naked body covered in mud, blood and
         ash.

         As the chopper, emerging from the vortex, settles
         towards the ground where the spacecraft once stood.
         Through the distorted veil, the helicopter, bristling
         with WEAPONS, VISORED and HELMETED MEN, now covered
         with WHITE ASH, looks like a landing spacecraft.



 235     EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                235

         The door gunner swings the M-60 into firing position,
         pointing it at Schaefer.  He racks the bolt, loading
         a round.

         The crewmen look tense, frightened.

         Anna, standing next to the door gunner, stares at the
         strange creature before her, narrowing her eyes,
         uncertain.  Is there something familiar about the
         figure?



 236     SCHAEFER                                             236

         stands in the clearing, staring at the helicopter and
         the array of weapons pointed at him.  He looks dazed,
         like a man making contact with members of an alien
         race, for the first time.



 237     THE HELICOPTER                                       237

         hovers low to the ground, the tension inside building
         as Schaefer approaches.

         More weapons swing into position.  Fingers tighten on
         triggers.  Suddenly Anna recognizes the figure.
         Realizing the danger she holds up her hands, shouting

                                 ANNA
                  NOOOOOO!!!!!!



 238     EXT. HELICOPTERS - JUNGLE - DAY                      238

         Flash overhead, heading across the trackless jungle,
         their rotors THUMPING like heavy machine gun fire.



 239     INT. HELICOPTER - DAY                                239

         Schaefer, a blanket over his shoulders, still in the
         remains of his mud camouflage, his body laced with
         deep cuts; his chest and shoulder caked with dried
         blood, is seated on a bench in the cargo hold.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

 239     CONTINUED:                                           239

         Near the cockpit are General Philips, an ARMY MEDIC,
         two MACHINE GUNNERS.  They look at Schaefer in awe.

         The Medic, holding an open FIELD KIT, a syringe and
         bandages, turns to Philips.

                                 MEDIC
                         (shaking his head)
                  Looks like he's been through
                  hell...can't believe he's
                  still alive.  What the hell
                  went on down there?

                                 PHILIPS
                  If it hadn't been for her, he'd
                  be dead now.  That story she
                  told us...I still can't believe
                  it.

         He looks at Anna, her eyes meeting his, as if asking
         for an explanation.  She looks at him a moment before
         turning back to Schaefer, staring at him as if he were
         risen from the dead.

         She looks into Schaefer's face, Schaefer returning her
         look, recognition passing between them.  Anna extends
         her hand.  Schaefer slowly reaches out, touching her
         fingers, then clasping her hand.

         Schaefer turns his eyes to stare out the open door,
         beyond the passing jungle below, out to the heavens.

         He turns back, looking at Anna, a faint smile crossing
         his face...they made it.

                         FADE IN:
          THE MOON. So fat and full in the night sky you can reach out
          and touch it.

          HICKS W. 0.
          This is what's known: There has always
          been man...and there have always been
          vampires.
          BLACK SHAPES swoop past the moonscape, vicious looking things.
          Much shrieking and wailing.
          Atop a STONE ZIGGURAT -- We see a GROUP OF MEN -- AZTEC
          WARRIORS readying themselves with PRIMITIVE WEAPONS --
          SLINGS, BOWS, SPEARS. Tonight they know they will die.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Since the beginning -- the two have been
          locked forever in combat... The vampires
          were quicker, stronger and had the gift
          of flight.
          Quick glimpses of a bloody, brutal battle. Men screaming.
          Talons ripping. FIERY ARROWS launched against an unseen enemy.

          WHOOSH!
          With a HOWL, we see A MAN plucked off the ground, his body
          disappearing in the night. THE IMAGE DISSOLVES as -- the sky
          turns bright, the moon becoming a familiar ball of yellow gas.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          But man had the sun.
          THE CAMERA TILTS DOWN to find another GROUP OF MEN -- more
          sophisticated than the first. Makeshift weapons made of metal
          and steel slung across their backs glinting in the sunlight.
          They stand before AN EARTHEN STRUCTURE, looks like a GIANT WASP
          NEST. Unsheathing their weapons, they step grimly inside.
          We HEAR a HISSING WAIL and the wielding of steel.

          HXCKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And so it went like this over many years.
          As man and vampire both evolved -- the
          wars became bloodier.
          From afar, we see GIANT STACKS OF CORPSES as hydraulic
          machines stack the black bodies into pyres as big as
          buildings, smoke rising to the sky in twisting columns.

          A LONE MAN

          Stands at the base of one of the mammoth pyres. Even from
          this angle we sens e his quiet dignity.

          HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Then came THE PRIESTS --
          The Man turns and we see his face is shadowed by a large
          CROSS TATTOO, cutting across his eyes and down the center.

          HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          -- Specially trained warriors in the art
          of vampire combat. They single-handedly
          turned the tide for the humans.
          Quick glimpses of a GROUP OF PRIESTS battling a FURY OF
          VAMPIRES (we still do not get a good look at them). Their
          technique is otherworldy -- combining the brutality of a
          Maori Warrior. with the grace of a Samurai.
           The--combat-is intense. Glorious. An explosion of blood and
          s b m i l

           HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Over time the vampire threat faded. The
          once fierce race now fatally diminished.
          A shadow of what they once. were.
          Through heavy smoke, we see a pile of VAMPIRE CORPSES, a
          ragged collection of fangs and claws.

          HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The remaining vampires were put Into
          camps and -- by decree of the High
          Clergy the Priests disbanded. The
          former warriors to be integrated as
          members of regular society.
          We see a WAX SEAL pressed onto an ancient parchment. The
          document carefully rolled and stored in an ORNATE CHAMBER.

          HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The human race thrived in relative
          quiet. The vampire menace quickly
          forgotten for other, more modern
          threats.

                         (BEAT)
          And the few surviving Priests faded Into
          quiet obscurity.
          The chamber is closed. We see an encrusted key turning in a
          heavy set lock and we --

          FADE TO BLACK.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          .s.
          Our story begins with the rusty SCRAPE of a windmill...

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. THE WASTELAND - DAY

          Dust swirls in nasty tangles.
          A LONE MALE FIGURE moves across the plain, long and lean in
          overalls. AARON PACE. Shadows flicker across his sunburned
          face, the windmill looming above him.
          in his hands is an ELECTRONIC DEVICE, he plunges it into the
          earth. It makes a series of CLICKING SOUNDS, reading the soil.
          Aaron looks up to see the silhouette of a WOMAN standing in
          the doorway of his CABIN.
          He smiles, waving to her. His wife.

          INT. OUTPOST 10 (NURSERY).- DUSK

          A pioneer's wood cabin.
          Aaron sits surrounded, a lattice work of vines covering the
          walls and floors in beautiful patterns. Not a trace of soil
          anywhere in the room, everything hydroponically grown.

          SHANNON (O.S.)
          Supper's on!
          He smiles, studying a. stunning RUBY RED FLOWER, separate from
          the others. His crown jewel. He closes the door and enters --

                         THE KITCHEN
          SHANNON PACE carries a bowl filled with a steaming green
          broth, placing it on the dinner table, moving aside a tiny
          FIGURINE OF JESUS. The surrounding furniture cluttered with
          religious knickknacks.

                         SHANNON (CONT'D)
          You been spending an awful lot of time
          behind that door. Makes a woman
          suspicious.

                         AARON
          Special project. It's taking a little
          more time than I thought.

                         SHANNON
          Nothing special about milkweed. Unless
          you like a thorn in the finger.

          It's not Milkweed. Not this year.

          What is it?

                         AARON
          You'll see.
          His eyes skate to her face moving in for the kiss -- but he's

          LUCY (0.S.)
          Yuck. Pershing-stew again.
          Their DAUGHTER (13). Already a heartbreaker. This girl is
          too young, too pretty to be out here in the badlands.

                         LUCY (CONT'D)
          I can't do it anymore. This outpost.
          Being all cooped up like this. I'm going

                         AARON
          Honey...we know this hasn't been easy for
          you -- In two years someone else'll study
          the soil and this'll be their outpost.
          But for right now -- this is my job.

                         LUCY
          I don't know what it's like to have a
          best friend. To have any friends. I
          want to have a crush. I want secrets.

                         (SIMPLY)
          I want a life.
          Shannon looks at her husband. She knew this day would come.

                         SHANNON
          Aaron. She's thirteen -- She should be
          with children her own age.
          Aaron lets out a breath.

                         AARON
          Okay. Next year, we'll figure out a way
          to get you to a school close by. In
          town.

                         LUCY

                         BUT

                         AARON
          N year -- that's still plenty of time
          for you to have a "crush".
          Lucy deflates, knowing this is as good as it's going to get
          for awhile. Aaron takes her hand.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          Tomorrow I'm heading in town to file.
          You come with, help your old man out, get
          a change of scenery. OK?

                         (BEAT)
          Now c'mon, stew's getting cold. Bow your
          heads and say grace.
          The family clasps hands. Whatever their differences, there's
          a bond here.

                         LUCY
          Dear Lord we thank you for what we are
          about to receive. Blessing us with your
          gifts...
          She.speaks with her eyes clenched shut, words spoken
          sincerely, nothing perfunctory about it. She's a believer.

                         LUCY (CONT'D)
          We thank you for the earth and the sky and
          for your bounty through Christ our Lord --
          She.stops, opening her eyes -- staring at the plates and
          glasses on the table.
          They're RATTLING.

                         AA RON
          Shh.
          He cocks his ear, heading a low rumble.
          Although he's never heard the sound before...he knows it can'
          only mean one thing.
          Trying to remain calm, Aaron goes to the window.

          OUT THE WINDOW
          Framed by a BLOOD MOON hanging over the horizon, a DOZEN BLACK
          MOTORCYCLES race across the plain, ENGINES thundering.

          The Jesus figurine falls off the table, SHATTERING to the
          floor.
          Aaron looks at Shannon, an expression on his face she hasn't
          seen before -

          What's going on?
          Aaron doesn't answer, Shannon helping him position pre-cut
          planks across every window and door. Each with an iron-cross
          strut for support

          EXT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME

           The CYCLES circle the house, kicking up dust in sheets.

          INT.. OUTPOST 10 - SAME

          The ROAR of the engines fills the house as Aaron pulls a
          POWERFUL LOOKING GUN from the drawer. He drops it, obviously
          not familiar with firearms.

                         AARON
          Get by me.
          Shannon-and Lucy crouch at his feet.

          EXT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME

          The cycles cut their engines, headlights centered on the
          house. A blistering spotlight.
          It's quiet.
          The RIDERS step from their machines. We don't get a look at
          their faces as one by one they LEAP onto the house and
          windmill, SKITTERING across the walls and roof like spiders.
          The blades of the windmill slowly come to a stop.

          We hear the Riders crawling over the outside of the house.
          Snarling, howling, making terrifying sounds.
          Then the worst sound of all. Wood being torn apart.
          BLAM! BLAN! Aaron SHOOTS like crazy, the white light MUZZLE
          FLASHES providing glimpses of SHAPES moving inside the house.
          BLACK BODIES blown back. Shrieking. Everything happening
          lightening fast.
          Finally, the gun clicks empty and we're plunged back into
          darkness.

          THE LIGHTS COME BACK ON
          Aaron is still standing, the house in shambles around him.
          He's alone.

          SHANNON!
          From outside we hear the cycles revving.
          Aaron runs to the door. Rips off the board in time to see --

          EXT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME

          The motorcycles racing away, a cloud of dust in their wake.
          Aaron runs after but TRIPS on --

                         SHANNON
          Her body lying in the dirt, head lurching at an obscene'
          angle. He brushes back her hair --
          ere' g UNCT_URE MABKS in hem neck.
          Crying, he cradles his, wife. Feverishly looking around for

                         AARON

          LUCY!
          He keeps screaming but it's no use -- as the-motorcycles fade
          in the night he knows --
          They've taken her.
          The CAMERA TILTS to the MOON hanging above the plain. it
          turns BLACK as we now find ourselves peering into --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

          EXT.. CITY FIVE/DISTRICT TWELVE - DUSK

          The lip of an ENORMOUS SMOKESTACK. One of hundreds. A
          seemingly endless brick forest reaching to a sky heavy with
          soot and ash, while below, miles of FACTORIES stretch and
          stretch.

          A STEAM WHISTLE BLOWS
          Quitting time. Hundreds of WORKERS trail listlessly from a
          massive brick and stone COMPLEX. Grey faces betraying
          another day's toll.

          A TATTOOED FIGURE
          moves through the crowd, people stepping out of his way.
          They do this not out of respect. . .but fear.
          We don't get a good look at him. Just FLASHES --
          Shaved head.
          Eyes like nail guns.
          Tendons clenching over muscle.
          As he walks,people whisper. He hears all of it.
          He heads into the streets. CITIZENS hurry by, some with.
          surgical masks over their mouths. There's a pale, sickliness
          to them. Malignant.
          The Figure suddenly stops. He cocks his bald head --
          Something's caught his attention...

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          We move through trash and shadow finding --
          A gang of FACTORY WORKERS, uniformed, surrounding a GIRL

          (12).
          Their LEADER holds her close, BUTCHER KNIFE at her
          throat. Mouth at her ear.

                         LEADER
          Go ahead ...scream.

                         (SMILES)
          Scream for daddy.
          He hears a noise, looks up and sees a SILHOUETTE standing at
          the head of the alley.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         LEADER (CONT'D)
          Looks like daddy's already here.
          (points the knife)
          Well, then. Come on daddy...make it
          better.
          The Figure steps into a pool of white light, giving us our
          first good look at him --
          A LAL RGE AK CROSS TATTOO shadows most of his-- a e. Across
          the eyes and down the center.
          The Mark Of The Priest.

                         LEADER (CONT'D)

                         (LAUGHS)
          A Priest! Well, lookie here.. We got us
          a real life war-hero boysl Heard you
          guys were real baddasses.
          The Workers all pull out large knives.

                         LEADER (CONT'D)
          Guess we'll find out.
          They move in on Priest, chemicals burning in their blood,
          mouths leering.
          Priest folds his hands into the prayer position.
          The Workers look at each other. Laugh.

                         WORKER #1-
          What's he gonna do. . .BLESS us to death?
          VOOMI -- There's a whirling SNARL of sound -- the sonic
          equivalent of a back flip and --
          Pries is holding their knives.
          Before they can react, he throws the knives into their feet.
          They HOWL, pinned to the concrete.
          Scared, the leader clutches the girl, pressing against the
          brick wall as Priest moves towards him.

                         LEADER
          This ain't the war no more. You got no
          right meddlin'.

                         (BEAT)
          You don't belong here -- You ain't one of
          us.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          And with that he RAISES the blade to the girl's throat --

                         C
          WHOOSHI A sudden RUSH OF AIR. The leader looks at the
          girl's neck, his blade's gone.
          So is his hand.
          Priest holds the severed limb, its fingers still clutching
          the blade. The Leader collapses, a Holy Shitl expression
          frozen on his face.

                         THE GIRL
          Gawks at Priest, possibly more frightened of him than the
          workers.
          He turns to her, wanting to comfort her but not knowing how --
          She flinches and runs away, disappearing into the street.
          A BEAT as Priest pries the butcher blade from the hand,
          wiping it off. Tucks it in his waistband.
          He moves on.

          EXT. CHURCH (ESTABLISHING) - NIGHT

          Gone to seed. The once proud house of God now a sad
          collection of moldering stone and cracked stained glass.

          INT. CHURCH

          PUSH past row after row of empty pews.
          We stop on the CONFESSIONAL BOOTH -- a foot sticking out from
          the door --

          INSIDE THE BOOTH
          FATHER KOEPPEN, body skinny and ravaged. The old man pours
          himself a drink and downs it. Coughing.
          The confessional door opens, someone steps inside the other
          booth. We can't see who it is.

                         FIGURE'
          Bless me Father for I have
          sinned...again.
          The voice is like gravel from the bottom of a deep well.
          Quietly commanding. Koeppen knows it well.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         KOEPPEN
          I caught the ambulance picking up what
          was left of the factory boys...figured it
          was your handywork.
          The Shape leans forward, we see it is Priest.

                         PRIEST
          This time there was a little girl.

                         KOEPPEN
          if this keeps occurring it'll be
          .impossible to keep it from the Clergy.
          You'll get us both excommunicated.
          Priest gazes into the vestibule, his voice almost a whisper.

                         PRIEST
          I want to see the other Priests.

                         KOEPPEN
          You know you can't. The Clergy forbids it.

                         PRIEST
          Why?

                         KOEPPEN
          They have their reasons.
          Priest flicks his eyes over Koeppen as if he could see
          through the vestibule, but his expression doesn't change.

                         PRIEST
          And their reasons for building more and
          more factories? The sky is turning black.

                         KOEPPEN
          Since when is. industriousness a sin? Did
          Jesus not teach us to be productive?

                         (BEAT)
          As your appointed counselor take my
          advice, . .Relax -- Take up a hobby, pick a
          vice. Make friends.

                         PRIEST
          You're my friend.

                         KOEPPEN
          I'm a wicked old man who'd sell his
          parish for a pint of whiskey.
          Priest seems to deflate, his hard shell cracking.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         PRIEST
          I don't know what's happening to me. (7,
          Questions. Doubts. I'm not sure what it
          is.
          Koeppen slides the vestibule open so they are now face to face.

                         KOEPPEN
          The devil comes in many shapes.
          Do yourself a favor, keep your head
          down. Be smart. And most of all
          remember your oath...
          He hands Priest a set of ROSARY BEADS.

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
          "To go against the Church is to go
          against God".
          This statement has always been the boilerplate of Priest's
          existence -- but tonight, it Just sounds like empty dogma. He
          squeezes his eyes shut, clutching the,rosary as we CUT TO:

          INT. LOBBY OF TENAMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

          Garbage litters the floor. The sound of water dripping.
          Priest stands, waiting for the lift to arrive.
          A BOY AND HIS MOTHER wait too. The boy stares at Priest,
          fascinated, his mother doing her best to pretend not to
          notice him.
          The elevator arrives and they step inside.

          INT. LIFT - MOMENTS LATER

          As it rises, a single bulb flickers above. Buzzing.
          The boy continues to stare at Priest, bewitched by the tattoo.

                         BOY

                         (TO PRIEST)
          Did it hurt?
          The lift grinds to a stop. The mother quickly pulls her son
          out as the door rolls open, glaring at Priest, disappearing
          down a dark corridor.
          And only now does Priest answer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         PRIEST

                         (SOFTLY)
          Yes.
          The lift door clatters shut.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. PRIEST'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Sparse, containing only what's needed.
          Priest peels off his shirt revealing a constellation of old
          battle scars -- Punctures. Scratches. Bite marks. His skin
          showing the early signs of aging.
          He goes to the lone decoration in his apartment --

          A FADED PHOTO OF THE PACE FAMILY
          He takes the picture off the wall, studying it. The image
          bringing him peace.
          From the streets below, the sound of a GUNSHOT.
          He looks at the rosary beads, still in his hand.
          He turns out the light.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - 3 AM

          Unable to sleep, Priest sits on the edge of his bed. Praying.
          There's a knock at the door.

                         PRIEST
          Who is it?

          MESSENGER (0. S.)
          Messenger.
          Priest opens the door. A MESSENGER holds up a PUNCH CARD.

          MESSENGER (CONY ' D)
          I gota Priority Punch. Originated in the
          wasteland.
          Priest takes the card, the man writing up a receipt.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          INT. PRIEST'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

          Priest goes to a WOODEN BOX, feeding the punch card into it.
          A Rube Goldberg-like device of PULLEYS and WINCHES squeaks to-
          life, like a sail, a SCREEN rises and Aaron appears, his image
          a smudge. He looks awful. A man at the end of himself.

                         AARON

                         (FILTERED)
          L-Lucy's gone. They t-took her. I tried
          to stop 'em.
          I knowouu're..."retired". But can you
          find her? Find her before --.

                         (SOBS)
          They killed Shannon.
          The screen goes blank.
          Priest shuts his eyes, making the sign of the cross.
          His hand curls into a fist.

          EXT. CLERGY CITY (ESTABLISHING) - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Magnificent.
          At the Cities center, a municipal of baroque BASILICAS AND
          .CHURCHES -- all safely walled off from the rest of the
          metropolis.

          INT. CLERGY CHAMBER - NIGHT

          Giant shafts of moonlight hit a marbled floor.
          Priest and Father Koeppen are led by FOUR OFFICERS before A
          TRIBUNAL OF MONSIGNORS (all at least in their 70's). They
          sit behind a giant table cloaked in the florid robes of their
          religion. Men of scripture, creed and doctrine.
          Priest kneels, bowing his head.

                         PRIEST
          Thank you for meeting with me on such
          short notice, Monsignors.
          Even the Monsignors are uneasy'around Priest. Their leader,
          ORELAS, leans forward, addressing him.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          Father Koeppen notified us of the
          situation. Our prayers are with your
          family.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         PRIEST
          I come before you because I would like my
          authority to be reinstated.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          On what grounds?
          Priest is taken aback.

                         PRIEST
          She's my blood, Monsignor.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          The proper authorities are handling the
          situation. I'm sure they'll.do a fine job.

                         PRIEST
          The proper authorities?

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          All occurrences of vampire. disobedience
          and felonies are strictly a Federal
          matter now.

                         (BEAT)
          You Priests did too good a job. The
          vampire population is classified as
          endangered. They're protected.

                         PRIEST
          But Monsignor...they are the enemy.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          Were.the enemy. The war ended a long
          time ago.

                         PRIEST
          Not so long that we should forget what
          they are capable of.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          You would do well to remember the words
          of our Savior: Turn the other cheek.
          Embrace your enemies.

                         (BEAT)
          It is not our place to interfere --- or
          yours.
          Priest looks up, obviously in great turmoil.

                         PRIEST-
          I can be of.great service to the
          investigation. I -can

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          0 The tribunal shifts uncomfortably, intimidated by Priest.
          Orelas stands.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          You forget yourself, Priest...
          It has been brought to our attention that
          you have engaged in a number of
          transgressions. Tell me...do you feel
          yourself to be above God?

                         PRIEST
          No, Monsignor.

                         MONSIGNOR ORELAS
          Engaging in any kind of practice is
          sacrilege -- You bring shame upon our
          house.
          Priest turns the full force of his gaze on him.

                         PRIEST
          "Let your light shine before men, that
          they may see your good works and glorify
          your Father which is in Heaven" --

          You dare quote scripture to met

          The officers start to lead Priest and Koeppen out the chamber,

          -- Eather..Kam, please stay behind
          for a moment, a .we have something we need
          to discuss.
          Off Koeppen's expression we CUT TO:

          EXT. SOUP KITCHEN - ESTABLISHING

          HOMELESS stand single file, wrapped around the corner, black
          flakes of ash drifting down as they await tonight's supper.

          INT. SOUP KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Priest sits alone, rosary beads clutched in his hands. He
          looks up to find Koeppen, the old man staggering as he downs
          an EXPENSIVE BOTTLE OF WHISKEY, three sheets to the wind.

                         KOEPPEN
          I knew I'd find you here.
          He sits, pouring himself another drink, toasting the poor
          souls at the surrounding tables.

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
          How many nights in this very spot? You
          with your endless questions on the nature
          of suffering-Me with none of the
          answers.
          Priest doesn't even acknowledge him, lost in his thoughts.

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
          Well, now I'm the one with a question.
          This one's a riddle.

                         (BEAT)
          What is greater than God-but more evil
          than the Devil? The poor have it, the
          rich need it -- and if you eat
          it...you'll die.
          Priest looks, up, his eyes cold.

                         PRIEST
          Why won't they listen to me?
          A beat. Koeppen takes another drink.

                         KOEPPEN
          Okay. I'm going to.give you one more
          riddle and if you listen close - you might
          just hear an answer to your question.
          (clears his throat)

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
          How can a man who spent his whole life
          searching for devils miss the ones
          staring him in the face?
          From behind, a CLICKING sound.
          Priest turns to find an OFFICER standing, LASER-GUIDED
          SHOTGUN pointed at him. The soup kitchen suddenly deathly
          quiet.

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
          The Church feels it's better to keep you
          under its care...at least until this
          trouble with your niece blows over..

                         PRIEST
          You know I can't do that.

                         KOEPPEN
          That's what I figured.

          TEN TROOPERS IN FULL RIOT GEAR STORM IN
          Jackboots CLACKING, they form a circle around Priest and
          Koeppen. Guns SNAP into place, laser points dotting his body.
          Priest looks at Koeppen -- betrayed.

                         PRIEST
          Why?

                         KOEPPEN

                         (TOASTING RUEFULLY)
          "To go against the Church is to go
          against God'.
          Priest looks around the room -- FAMILIES AND HOMELESS huddle
          at the surrounding tables, terrified.
          There's only one thing left for him to do.

                         PRIEST
          Then ...I go against God.
          In an eyeblink --
          Priest strips the gun from the nearby officer, CRACKING it
          against the trooper's head, his attack graceful and precise --
          a whirlwind of PINPOINTED BLOWS and SHATTERED BONES.
          When it's over, eleven troopers lie on the ground writhing.
          Everything goes quiet.

          ANGLE ON: A LITTLE BOY
          He breaks, from his father.'' knee, slowly moving towards the
          window, drawn by a FLICKERING SHADOW.
          His mouth drops open as --

          WHAM! -- TWENTY MORE TROOPERS
          PUNCH through the windows in unison, showering everybody with
          glass! BULLETS whistle through the air, everyone SCREAMING
          as they scramble for cover. The father diving for his son.

                         PRIEST
          Folds his hands into the prayer position.
          VOONI There's a POP OF AIR and ---

                         '

                         SILENCE
          The: troopers look around confused -- their guns have
          disappeared.

          A...,

          ON A NEARBY TABLE
          A neat pile of shotguns sit, every FIRED BULLET collected
          harmlessly in a clean circle around them ...as if picked out
          of thin air.

          THE LITTLE BOY
          is somehow back with his father, the two safely holding
          hands, staring stupidly at each other.
          Priest is gone.

                         KOEPPE4
          Looks at his fancy whiskey bottle, inside now floats Priest's
          ROSARY BEADS. He fishes them from the bottle, hand shaking.

                         KOEPPEN
          Heaven help us.
          He takes a swig.

          The STRIKE of a match -- a prayer candle is lit, glowing in

          AT THE ALTAR
          Priest kneels, eyes clenched shut in prayer. A large
          figurine of Jesus on the cross looms over him. The Christ is
          expressive -- He suffers.

                         PRIEST
          oh my God...I am sorry for. having offended
          you. it was never my intention to do so...
          His words continue OVER

          EXT. STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT

          Priest standing in front of a STEEL DOOR. Hasn't been opened
          for some time.

          PRIEST (O.S.)
          I want so much to firmly resolve with the
          help of your grace to sin no more and to
          .avoid the near occasions of sin.

          INT. STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT

          The DOOR slides open just a crack. A sliver of light landing
          on a piece of BLACK SCULPTED METAL.

          But I can't.

          An ENGINE ROARS, RUMBLES, idling... a throaty GURGLE... Priest
          pulls out on a

                         BLACK MOTORCYCLE
          if this thing were a horse it'd be the ultimate stallion--
          Pulse engine. Nitrous. The works. A panel of black titanium
          solar cells covers the bike like armor.
          He races onto the street.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Sheets of rain fall like lead. Pooling in the gutters.

          PRIEST (O.S.)
          All I can do is ask for forgiveness for
          what is yet to come...

          The cycle knifes through the city. Expertly working his way
          through congested streets. Moving past tent cities,
          stockyards and rusty industrial machinery.

          EXT. CITY LIMIT - NIGHT

          We see a MASSIVE WALL -- A hundred feet high, surrounding the
          city. Priest pulls up to a CHECKPOINT TOWER. A PHALANX OF
          GUARDS with big shotguns at the ready, snapping into place.
          Mugs like anvils.

          PRIEST (O.S.)
          I now know the devil lives within me.
          The sins coming all too easy...
          Still on his bike, Priest's foot touches the ground, blocking
          our view as we CUT TO:

          THE MASSIVE DOOR/WALL sliding open with a KLANG1 revealing

          PRIEST (0.3.)
          And all too frequently.
          Priest REVS his bike, gunning out the doors. UNCONSCIOUS

          Priest's cycle streaks across the salt flats. It's glorious.

          EXT. WASTELAND - LATER

          Priest rides past a line of ANCIENT STATUES dominating the
          landscape, each representing one of the seven deadly sins,
          sentinels marking the boundary into the deep wasteland.
          He FLOORS it, the bike PUNCHING for the horizon, a thick plume
          of dust funneling behind it...

          EXT. OUTPOST 10 - NIGHT

          It's quiet, Just the sound of the rusty windmill. The only
          light provided by the moon reflecting off Priest's cycle,
          he's just arrived.
           He crouches, examining,a fresh TIRE TREAD. He stares, taking in
          the landscap e, feeling it.
          Then he steps inside the cabin --

          INT. OUTPOST 10

          It looks like a war zone. Splintered furniture everywhere,
          sprays of dried, black blood over the floorboards.
          He brushes away rubble and finds a DRESS, Shannon's. Putting
          his face to it, he inhales, his expression softening.

                         BEHIND HIM
          Quietly, A COWBOY HAT and a SHOTGUN BARREL emerge from a hole
          in the floor.

                         COWBOY HAT
          Alright, now -- Not another step.
           Climbing out from the hole, both barrels pointed, is SHERIFF
          HICKS (22). You could say the name fits. But you'd only be
          half right.

                         HICKS
          Thought you'd come back for a souvenir,
          hub? You gotta be the dumbest
          bloodsucker I ever come across.
          Priest steps into a pool of moonlight, illuminating his face.

                         PRIEST
          If I was a vampire you'd be dead already.
          The cross tattoo, a striking image. Hicks stares, pushing
          his hat back on his forehead.

                         HICKS
          I'll be dammed.
          He casually spits some ATOMIC CHAW, hitting the floorboards
          with a SIZZLE.

          EXT. HALBRIDGE - NIGHT

          Hicks and Priest ride in tandem across the plain. Hicks'
          bike a standard police vehicle, nothing fancy but reliable.
          They head towards town, passing aWOODEN SIGN`--

                         HALBRIDGE

          EXT. HALERIDGE (MAIN STREET) - NIGHT

          At a glance this seems like one of those frontier towns from
          an old western.
          TOWNSPEOPLE gather around a SNAKE-OIL SALESMAN, the man
          pitching his wares before a painted van reading DR. TOMLIN'S
          MEDICINE SHOW. TRANCE MUSIC wafts from the nearby saloon.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
          Do I ask for three dollars?' Do I ask for
          two dollars? No folks! ONE dollar! One
          piece of tin and protection is yours!

          PRIEST AND HICKS
          Pull up in front of the Jail. Hicks eyes the salesman,
          coolly dismounts and adjusts his hat.

                         HICKS
          â¢Scuse me a minute,
          He heads towards the crowd, the salesman continuing his pitch.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
          Vampires are a deadly lot! YOU could be
          next I I seen a Blackblood bite a man
          like a gingersnap! The only sure way to
          be safe is a bag of DR. TOMLIN' S WONDER

                         POWDERT

          If you care about your loved ones then
          you MUST have this amazing elixir in your
          homes tonight --
          WHOOSH! A KNIFE slices through the air, spears the sack and
          pins it to a nearby wall with a THUNK.
          Hicks steps to the front of the crowd. it's his knife.

                         HICKS
          You best get in that van and clear on
          out, mister.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
          For what reasons? I'm a legitimate
          business man.
          Hicks PULLS his SIX-SHOOTER, cocks it.

                         HICKS
          I got six right here.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
          Sheriff, I am shocked you can be.so
          cavalier with the safety of your

                         TOWNFOLK --
          HAM! A bullet blows out the van's headlight.

                         HICKS
          That's one.
          KAPOW! The windshield cracks like a spiderweb.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Two.
          Immediately, the salesman quickly packs up his wares,
          scrambling for the van door. As he gets in, he catches a
          look at Priest, pauses a moment, then starts up the vehicle
          and quickly PEELS away.
          Hicks pulls the knife from the wall, holds the bag up to the
          crowd.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Now you all listen up. This bag ain't
          good fornothin' but linin' that man's
          pockets with your hard earned money.
          Much shuffling amongst the people -- they trust in their
          sheriff but they're frightened. An older man named, CROCKER,
          steps up.

                         CROCKER
          You don't know'that. You're just a kid.

                         HICKS
          I seen enough two-bit hustlers and carry
          barkers. He ain't no better.

                         CROCKER
          But what if he's right?
          Hicks tosses the sack to Crocker.

                         HICKS
          Take a look.
          (Crocker does, the contents
          spilling to the ground)
          Ain't nothin' but sand, flour and maybe 'a

          But those vampires headed clear .on out
          and they ain't comin' back.

                         WOMAN
          And what about the girl?
          Hicks pauses. This is not easily said.

                         HICKS
          I filed a report with the Cities last
          night. I'm sure they're Join' all they
          can.
          The townspeople mutter amongst themselves. Hicks looks over
          to Priest, a GROUP OF CHILDREN have already gathered,.
          pointing and whispering at him.

          INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          A hole in the wall. A few wanted posters and postal warrants
          tacked up on a board beside asingle jail cell.
          Hicks leads Priest inside.

                         HICKS
          I've already had one of the boys send for
          your brother. We got him put up at
          Paddy's place.
          Priest gazes out . the; window. A group of TOWNSPEOPLE are
          milling out front, staring at him.. He pulls down the shade.

          HICKS (CONT' D)
          You're gonna have to excuse the
          attention.. We don't get strangers `round
          here too much -- "Specially no Priest.
          'Course we ain't never had no vampire
          attack in.these parts before.
          (eyeing Priest.)
          But then you're just here to perform the
          service, right?
          Priest doesn't reply, staring at a yellowed wanted poster.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Never much of a believer myself. I
          figure I got one bullet to shoot. I'm
          gonna shoot it my way... not how some BOOK
          tells me to.

                         (SPITS)
          But I do hear things...it true what they
          may about you folks?

                         (BEAT)
          You can fold time?
          At that, Priest turns, looking at Hicks. Before he can
          answer the door opens and --

                         AARON
          comes through, looking older than the last time we saw him.
          Seeing Priest, his face cracks, smiling for the first time in
          days.

                         AARON
          You came.
          Overcome, he wraps his arms around his brother, embracing.
          him. Priest hugs him back.

          EXT. CEMETARY ' - DAY

          A BLIND GRAVEDIGGER plays an old.SQQUEEZEBOX, hands expertly
          working the bellows. He's done this for every.,funeral in
          Halbridge for the last fifty years. The sad music drifts
          across the wasteland.

                         SHANNON'S COFFIN
          Lies in a freshly dug hole. Priest sprinkles dirt across.the
          casket, offering prayers.
          Aaron watches,. silently. A GROUP OF TOWNSPEOPLE encircle the
          grave. Everyone wearing black goggles for protection from
          the swirling dust.

                         HICKS
          Stands apart from the others, hat in his hands. His eyes
          focused on Priest. Not even watching as --
          Aaron plants the RUBY RED FLOWER at the head of the grave.
          Its glorious color almost obscene in this barren wasteland.

          INT. PADDY'S PLACE - DAY

          A DOG rests lazily in front of a rotating fan.
          PADDY'S a bear of a man, the town bachelor. He plops down two
          bowls of brown stew before a waiting and hungry Aaron and
          Priest, The gruel smells foul, tastes fouler.

                         PADDY
          Jackrabbit Stew. Never served no man of
          the cloth before. Hope you like it
          spicy, Father!
          He stands over both of them, eager for a response. Priest
          takes a sip, grimaces, tries his best to smile but fails
          hideously.

                         PRIEST
          .Delicious

                         PADDY
          (slaps him on the back)
          `Course it isl it was me Ma's recipe.
          As Paddy jubilantly walks away, Priest puts the bowl on the
          floor and the dog pads over, eagerly lapping it up. Aaron
          smiles.

                         AARON
          How come you never came round more? You
          know you were always welcome.

                         PRIEST
          I know.

                         AARON
          After the war was over we figured you'd
          stay with us. Shannon was real fond of
          you. Lucy too. She was always asking
          about you.
          Uncomfortable with the conversation, Priest pulls out a map,
          unrolling it onto the wooden table. He moves his finger
          across the paper.

                         PRIEST
          The pack headed in this direction.
          There's a reservation up that way so
          that's where I'll start.

                         AARON
          if anyone finds out you're doing this --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.
          o r PRIEST
          You're my brother.
          Aaron nods. This is enough,

          PRIEST (CONT' D)
          I'll find her.

                         AARON
          And you' 11 bring her back to me.
          Something in Priest's face darkens. He doesn't answer, not
          able to look his brother in the eye.

          INT. GUN SHOP - DAY

          A SHOPCLERK mops the floor, guns of all types lining his
          walls. Everything from old Smith and Wesson's to the latest
          and most powerful hand cannons.
          With a jingle, the door opens revealing Priest. The clerk
          smiles. All he needs is one look and he knows -- This guy's
          good for business.

                         CLERK
          Good afternoon, sir! How may I be of
          service?

                         PRIEST
          I need bullets.

                         CLERK
          How many?

                         PRIEST
          How many do you have?
          The clerk laughs... then realizes he's serious.

                         CLERK
          No offense, Father. You got a permit,
          right?

                         PRIEST
          I have this.
          He pulls out a sack of coins, it hits the counter with a
          solid THUD.
          The clerk smiles wider..

          INT. PADDY'S PLACE - NIGHT

          Hundreds of bullets all orderly lined on a table top.
          Priest site with his back to us, hunched over a candle.
          We're unable to see what he's doing. Aaron picks up a
          bullet, twirling it in the light.

                         AARON
          Maybe if I knew how to use these she'd
          still be alive.

                         PRIEST
          Sometimes things just happen. Fault's
          got nothing to do with it.

                         AARON
          Funny. I'm the one who used to say that.
          You were the one who always said
          everything was God's will.
          Priest takes the bullet from him.

                         PRIEST
          I'm not so sure anymore.
          There's a KNOCK at the door. Aaron opens it slightly. It's
          Sheriff Hicks.

                         HICKS
          Aaron.

                         AARON
          Sheriff.

                         HICKS
          You mind if I have a word-with your
          brother?
          An awkward BEAT as the two stare at each other. Both knowing
          what the other's thinking.

          PRIEST (0.S.
          It's alright. Let him in.
          Eyeing Priest, Aaron lets the Sheriff in, shutting the door
          behind him as he leaves. The vibe in the room is
          uncomfortable -- Priest not even acknowledging Hicks.

                         HICKS
          I'm sure you're well aware of the Vampire
          Protection Act.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          it strictly states it is forbidden for
          anyone to hunt vampires anymore.

                          C
          Priest doesn't say anything, he just keeps working.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          These days, things go through proper
          channels. Paperwork drawn up.
          investigators called in. Procedures
          followed.
          (spits, a wad of tobacco)

          I'm sure you also wouldn't be surprised
          to know my office's'been contacted. I'm
          supposed to arrest you on sight.
          He pulls a SHINY OBJECT from his pocket, puts it on the table
          beside Priest.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          On the other hand -- if I go after Lucy
          there'll be a warrant on mybead
          too...and that'll put us in the same
          briar patch.

                         O
          Priest looks at the object -- It's Hicks' sheriff's badae.
          Five points glowing brightly in the candlelight.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          We leave at sun up.
          Priest turns. A moment as each man studies the other.

                         PRIEST
          Why?

                         HICKS
          We're the only chance she's got.
          Priest picks a bullet from the table, a carefully notched
          CROSS now in its tip (this is what he's been doing). He
          SNAPS it in the air.

                         PHHHHTTI
          Hick's knife FLIES across the room, PINNING the bullet to the
          wall. A thin trickle of gun powder leaks from its casing,
          spilling to the floor. The kid's fast.

                         PRIEST
          How you with a gun?

                         HICKS
          Better than I am with a knife.
          Priest considers this.

                         PRIEST
          I'll be there.
          Nothing more needing to be said, Hicks turns to walk out,
          stops at the door.

                         HICKS
          What's with all the bullets anyway? I
          thought Priests don't use firearms.

                         PRIEST
          We don't.

                         (BEAT)
          They're for you.
          Hicks nods, realizing Priest was ahead of him the whole time.

          INT. BEDROOM NIGHT

          Moonlight streams through an open window.
          Priest places his bible on the nightstand and crouches beside
          the:.bed, closing his eyes. Hands clasped.

                         PRIEST
          Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be
          thy name. Thy Kingdom come Thy will be
          done on earth as it is in heaven...
          As he continues THE CAMERA slowly moves OUT THE WINDOW and
          into the night, moving across HALBRIDGE.

          PRIEST (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
          those that trespass against us and lead
          us not into temptation but deliver us
          from evil.
          We see the TOWNSPEOPLE: lock their doors, bolting the
          shutters, tucking their children in safely for the night.

          PRIEST (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          For thine is the kingdom and the power and
          the glory, forever and ever. Amen.
          And now the camera stops on a LARGE SHADOWY FIGURE perched on a
          nearby roofline.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          The only thing we can see of it is a DUSTER illuminated by
          the SOFT GLOW OF A LIT CHEROOT...the Figure watches Priest as
          he finishes his prayer and blows out a candle.
          Silently, the Figure takes off. Flying into the night.

          Sunlight hits Shannon's grave, the CROSS MARKER casting a

          moved by the sight, maybe even cried. This morning... nothing.
          Priest is beside him.

          Did it help?
          Priest doesn't answer, the question hanging overhead, a dark
          cloud.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          I never used to be much on faith. You

          `round the Wasteland better than just
          `bout anyone. '
          Without so much as a word, Priest climbs on his cycle and
          kick starts it, the engine REVVING to life.
          VROOMI off he goes. Hicks can't help but laugh.

          A SERIES OF ADOBES sit clustered in the basin. CRYPTS.

          The Nightshade Reservation.. Ain't

          They're a fallen tribe.

                         PRIEST
          Either way. We have two hours to get in
          and out.

                         HICKS
          What happens in two hours?

                         PRIEST
          Sundown.
          Hicks looks up at the sky. The sun tilting towards the
          horizon.

          Priest and Hicks enter engines idling, flocks of chickens run
          riot underneath their tires CLUCKING. wildly. Crumbling
          structures. Squalor.

                         HICKS
          This is how most of the reservations are
          these days.
          We see faces peering out from wooden slats. Gaunt,: lifeless
          eyes. These'are FAMILIARS.

                         PRIEST
          Familiars are illegal.

                         HICKS
          Nobody really enforces it. most come
          from the fringes. Drifters. They're
          creepy as all hell -- but harmless.
          They turn off their bikes and dismout. Hicks stepping
          awkwardly between the chickens.
          A MALE FAMILIAR stands with a butcher knife over a basin.
          His gaze is slack -- More dead than alive. He picks up a
          chicken and CHOP1 off goes its head, blood draining into the
          container.
          His voice a hissing rasp.

                         S

          Good afternoon, Sheriff... Father. What
          brings you to Nightshade?

                         HICKS
          We're looking for a Vamp Pack. They
          woulda' came through here a couple nights
          ago.

                         FAMILIAR
          Nobody comes through Nightshade. That's
          the way we like it. Nice and quiet.

                         HICKS
          Then you won't mind if we have a look
          around?
          The Familiar picks up another chicken. Raises the butcher
          knife.

                         FAMILIAR
          Not at all.

          Priest and Hicks move through the reservation looking for
          clues. Priest goes to the nearest structure, TWO EYES peer
          from a tiny slat. The CRYPT'S FAMILIAR.

                         PRIEST
          We're not going to find anything out
          here...We have to get into the crypts.

                         HICKS
          Not supposed: to do that without a warrant --
          BAMI -- Priest kicks the door in.
          We hear the Familiar SCREECH as Priest steps inside --

          INT. CRYPT - CONTINUOUS

          The light of the sun's never been in here. Probably should
          have stayed this way. Tiny bones-cover the entire floor.,
          excrement smearing the walls.
          The Crypt Familiar cowers-in the corner, shielding his eyes
          from-the light. His body'fishbelly white and sickly.

          angry!
          Nicks is grimacing from the stench. He looks at Priest, not
          happy as he approaches a STONE SARCOPHAGUS. Running his hand
          over it.

                         PRIEST
          Where's the girl?

                         CRYPT FAMILIAR
          PLEEASE please got

                         PRIEST

                         CRYPT FAMILIAR
          NOt NOI THE MASTER CANNOT BE DISTURBEDI
          Priest rests his hand against the. atone slab covering.the
          tomb. It must weigh 200 pounds. He moves the slab. Just a
          centimeter -- but the Familiar screeches.

                         PRIEST
          Wh re is she?

                         CRYPT FAMILIAR

          Please. Please don't hurtmy Master.

                         PRIEST
          Your.Master'll be dead.
          He shoves the slab more, the light rays hanging just outside
          the edge.
          And now The Familiar begins to laugh, a horrible rattling
          sound. Something in his mood has shifted.

                         CRYPT FAMILIAR
          No, i don't think so.
          Hearing a noise, Hicks turns, witnessing a horrible sight
          moving towards him

          THE NIGHTSHADE FAMILIARS
          About ten of them. Real Night Of The Living Dead stuff.
          Makeshift weapons in their hands:. Scythes, Slingblades,
          Buzzsaws.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.7.
          Before Hicks can react --

                         A FAMILIAR
          Attacks, BUTCHER BLADE raised. CHOP! the blade buries itself
          in Hicks' arm!

                         HICKS
          Lets loose with a mean roundhouse. Plugging him in the
          chest. in one quick motion he rips the butcher blade from
          his arm, flinging it at the nearest

                         FAMILIAR
          The blade lodges in his skull and he drops like a sack.
          These guys move surprisingly fast -- Hicks is already
          surrounded. He hears a whistling noise as

          A BUZZSAW BLADE
          knifes through the air heading straight for him. He DUCKS,
          the blade whistling past, sawtoothing into the torso of
          another Familiar.

                         HICKS
          Pulls off his COWBOY HAT. Activating a release. With a
          CLICK! thousands- of needle--like teat ext e d fro the brim.
          With deadly accuracy, he flings the hat: It FLASHES through
          the air, DAIS'iWHEELING around a Familiar's neck, pinpricking
          his skin and finally whirling back to Hicks' band likean
          obedient pup.
          A BEAT as the Familiar stands, mouth agape. Then with a wet
          SNAP his head rolls off his shoulders, THUDDING in the dirt.
          Hicks falls to the ground, his wound starting to get the best
          of him. He musters up his strength for another hat attack
          but before he can --

                         PRIEST
          Leaps in front. Blocking his way.

                         PRIEST
          Not yet.
          With a HORRIBLE SCREECH the Familiars attack, LAUNCHING at
          Priest and Hicks. Blades in the air.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.
          Priest CHARGES into the frenzy. A juggernaut. His movements
          clean and calculated, bones breaking around him with a wet
          snap, bodies THUDDING at his feet.
          When the dust clears, Priest stands alone... and he is holding
          their weapons.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          Now we can do this easy --
          He tosses the BUTCHER KNIFE, it sticks in the ground a
          hairline from a Familiar's head.

                         PRIEST (CONTID)
          Or we can do this HARD --
          Priest flings another BLADE. This one PLANTS in the leg of
          the Familiar. He HOWLS.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          Where is she?

                         THE FAMILIAR

                         (CACKLING)
          You're too late, Priest --
          He points to the horizon, the last rays of daylight
          disappearing.

                         CRYPT FAMILIAR
          It's our time now.
          We hear a LOW RUMBLE from inside the crypts. Priest looks at
          Hicks, a feeling of dark electricity in the air, anticipation.

                         PRIEST
          They get your gun arm?

                         HICKS
          Why?

                         PRIEST

          BURST from the crypt doorways SCREECHING as they fly into the
          air. Circling above the reservation like a nest of angry
          hornets. Disturbed.
          WHOOSH! One of the figures SWOOPS low, touching to the
          ground. Giving us our first good look at a vampire;
          Wet, white skin.
          Insect clicking claws.
          Black eyes.
          Fangs.
          More creature than human.
          The vampire cackles, sounds like dried paper, its voice a
          series of teeth clicking hisses. as it eyes Priest angrily.

                         LEAD VAMPIRE
          What are you doing here,. Priest... haven't
          you already done enough?

          We don't want a fight. We're just
          looking for the girl.
          The vampire sneers and as it speaks the following -- one
          by one, the OTHERS drop from the sky, flanking him. They're
          scraggly, a little undernourished.

                         LEAD VAMPIRE
          Look at us -- Living in ruin, forced to
          feed off the blood of animals. We once

          ONE BLACK FIGURE still flies above. Like a vulture, it
          circles Hicks. Marking him.

                         THE CROSSES
          CUT through the air, heading straight for the BLACK FIGURE.

          And then all hell breaks loose.
          The Nightshade Vampires hiss. Bearing their fangs like
          cobras and taking to the air with a SHRIEK. Attacking.
          Frightened beyond shit-all-belief -- Hicks FIRES wildly,
          chasing the creatures with his gunfire. His bullets
          whistling harmlessly through the air.
          WHOOSH! A vampire swoops towards him, fangs bared, claws
          ready to rip.

          Leaps at the creature just in time, driving it to the ground.
          in one brutal motion he. straddles it, twisting its head at a
          horrible angle.
          He turns to Hicks.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)

          FOCUS.
          And with that he's gone, rolling across the ground like a
          boulder and LEAPING at TWO DARTING VAMPIRES.

                         HICKS
          Dazed, watches as the vampire's body erupts with death
          spasms, arms and legs kicking the air in a violent frenzy
          until finally all life drains away.

                         HICKS
          (under his breath)
          Jesus.
          Another VAMPIRE careens towards him. Coming in low, crawling
          across the ground on all fours. Fangs dripping.
          Hicks FIRES off a mess of bullets, peppering the creature as
          it flails backwards screeching. He snaps out the empty
          shells, reloading almost supernaturally fast, firing off a
          shot that SPLITS the Vampire's throat.
          He twirls the gun, flipping it into his holster.
          This leaves only

          THE LEAD VAMPIRE
          Perched atop his crypt like a gargoyle, raging at Priest and
          Hicks from the depths of hell with at HORRIBLE SHRIEK.
          In full fury, he LEAPS and flies away, the sounds of his
          torment echoing throughout the canyon as he vanishes into the
          night sky.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)

          Priest goes to the Familiars still lying on the ground.
          They're sobbing, having lost everything in the world that
          mattered. Completely wrecked. He grabs one by the scruff of
          the neck.

          back for more. Claws digging into flesh.
          Priest wrenches around and the two go at it. A fierce, feral
          battle. The Vampire's fangs chattering inches from his neck.
          Their bodies lock in a horrible struggle, rolling across the
          Familiars. The Vampire's claws CHURNING into their bodies,
          killing them instantly.

                         THE VAMPIRE
          Throws Priest into a crypt, SMASHING him through the wall,
          flying in after him. We hear the sounds of a BATTLE ROYALE
          from inside. WHUMPI WHUMPI WHUMP! The walls buckle outward,
          sounds like the fury of all hell being unleashed.
          Then, suddenly, and'more disturbingly...,s â g.
          Hicks takes a step towards the crypt. Gun leveled. But --

                         PRIEST
          Emerges through the hole, exhausted, the LEAD VAMPIRE'S HEAD in
          his hand dangling by its hair.
          He tosses the head and it rolls to Hicks' feet, fangs flashing
          up at him. Hicks stares at the ghastly visage. Unnerved.

          EXT. NIGHTSHADE RESERVATION - LATER

          A giant PYRE lights up the night, fed with the bodies of both
          Familiars and Vampires, Priest and Hicks silhouetted against
          the flames.
          The two are silent, grimly going about their task -- It's
          obvious the skirmish has affected Hicks. Priest notices.

                         PRIEST
          How's your arm?

                         HICKS
          Lucky I guess. The blade didn't go that
          deep.
          (fingering the bandage)
          Don't know what got into those Familiars
          to attack like that. They're usually
          harmless.
          Priest finds a KNIPE clutched in a dead Familiar's hand,
          tucks it in his waistband.

                         PRIEST
          Usually.
          A BEAT as they listen to the popping of the fire. A tension
          hanging between them. Then -

                         HICKS
          You did this on purpose, didn't you? You
          knew we wouldn't. be out before sundown.
          You wanted this to happen.

                         PRIEST
          You don't have the stomach for it --head
          back to Haibridge right now.
          Hicks glares at Priest.

                         HICKS
          The stomach I got. I was in the Rangers
          two years. Even fought in the Boondock
          Uprising...I saw some crazy things.

                         HORRIBLE THINGS

                         (SOFTER)
          I just ain't never seen anything like
          this.

                         PRIEST
          Killing a vampire isn't like killing a
          man. They come at'you like an animal.
          Tooth for tooth.

          If you let `em.
          Hicks studies Priest, in the firelight he looks tired. Old
          even.

                         HICKS
          it comes easy to you... don't it?

                         PRIEST
          What?

                         HICKS
          Killin'.

                         PRIEST
          it just comes. Easy's got nothing to do
          with it.
          He pokes at the fire, it CRACKLES, feeding off the bodies.
          Something about the battle's opened him up. His guard's down.

          PRIEST (CONT' D)
          I take no pleasure in it. Killing. I
          know I've done more than my share --
          Whatever they do to me I have it coming.

                         HICKS

                         (REALIZING)
          You think they took her because of
          you... don't you?
          Priest stands. Cracks his neck.

                         PRIEST
          Give me your gun.

                         HICKS
          What?

                         PRIEST
          Give me your gun.

                         HICKS
          Why? You gonna shoot me now?
          Priest's stare is piercing. A pause then Hicks pulls his six
          shooter, handing it to him. Priest checks the chambers,
          giving it a quick spin.

                         PRIEST
          Don't anticipate the trajectory of your
          target. Know it.
          He stomps his foot into the fire, launching a GLOWING COAL OF
          ASH into the air. Priest quickly raises the gun and FIRES,
          the ash explodes, raining fiery red sparks.

                         HICKS
          You're teaching me to shoot?

                         PRIEST
          I'm teaching you to kill vampires. No
          more wild shots --

                         HICKS
          My ass I In case you didn't notice I was
          pretty damn good out there! And I sure
          as hell didn't see you doin' much when I
          had that blade buried in my arm.

                         (SPITS)
          Must've been too busy "focusing".
          Priest hands the gun back to Hicks.

                         PRIEST
          There's always-two points. A and B.
          Know the points and you'll know your
          target.

                         HICKS
          Ain't nothin' but a bunch of bullshit.

                         PRIEST
          I see ten crypts ...but only eight
          vampires. We find the missing, we'll
          find-Lucy.' What's the next nearest town?

                         HICKS
          Jericho. It's clear across the Plains.
          Gonna be a rough ride.

                         PRIEST
          Then you better get a good night's sleep.
          This bunch was easy, their bloodlines
          watered down by man.

                         (BEAT)
          Whoever took Lucy was a whole different
          breed.
          He tosses another body on the fire, tiny sparks floating into
          the night as --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          We hear the Banshee call of a STEAM WHISTLE, sharp and shrill
          as we CUT TO:

          EXT. DUNKIRK RAIL - NIGHT


          A STEAM LOCOMOTIVE
          Bearing down like death itself, teeth of the behemoth's grill
          leering: like a skull. Thick clouds of heavy smoke burst from
          its blast pipe, rails SQUEALING as the train RACES past.
          There re no Windows, just an unblinking black juggernaut,
          midnight willed into.a steel and iron frame. Terrifying.

          INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          As the cars BLAST PAST THE CAMERA we see each is filled with
          rows of BLACK COFFINS. A TALL FIGURE walks between them,
          wearing a BLACK TOP HAT AND CAPE.
          We only see 12im from behind.
          PALE ARMS reach from within the coffins, fingers touching the
          hem of the Figure's cape as he walks past.
          â¢ A FAMILIAR approaches.

                         FAMILIAR
          A man came on board at the last stop.
          Says he has something for you.
          The Figure nods. We-FOLLOW as he continues to the back of
          --- the car, sliding open the door

          INT. DINING CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Fine china on oak tables. The SNAKE OIL SALESMAN we saw back
          in Halbridge sits, nervously, in a plush chair. Candles
          light the car, casting the room in a surreal flicker.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
          You told me tQ come to you if I had any
          information.

                         (SMILES)
          I have some.
          Silently, the Figure sits down across from him.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D)
          But before I tell you...and I hate to bring
          this, up -- there is the small matter

          you a deal
          The Figure suddenly. LUNGES, grabbing the salesman by the
          throat, teeth clicking inches from the man's neck. WE STILL

          DO NOT SEE HIS FACE.

                         BLACK HAT
          I can SMELL the blood racing through your
          veins... Smells like dinner.
          The salesman starts to shake.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN

                         (VOICE QUAVERING)
          A-After you snatched that girl outside
          Haibridge...two nights later -- a Priest
          s-showed up.

                         BLACK HAT
          A Priest?

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN
          He was meetin' with the local sheriff. A
          real shitkicker -- Booted me out of town
          before I could make a single sell.
          A pause..,.and then the Figure laughs. The salesman not sure
          how to react.

          SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D)
          W-What's so funny?
          The Figure BURIES his teeth in the man's neck, taking a deep,
          deep drink, having his fill, dropping the body to the floor
          with a thud.
          THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW as the Figure walks to the
          back of the car, sliding open the door --

          of the girl we met earlier already lost.

          you'll be torn apart a piece at a time.
          He walks to her, face still hidden in shadow. She starts to
          cry, pulling back to the wall. Angry.

                         LUCY
          My uncle's a Priestl one of the best.
          Hooll corns after youl

           And now we get our first look at her captor. A cross tattoo

          A SERIES OF SHOTS
          WE WATCH as the sun crests the horizon and rises quickly
          across the sky. Clouds whip past at incredible speeds, time
          unfolding like a hallucinogenic until we're faced with --

                         THE PLAINS
          They sit parked on a bluff, the emptiness making Hick's eyes
          ache. A more desolate view couldn't be found in all of hell.

                         HICKS
          Walkin' Pete talked about this place --
          said it. used to be really somethin'.

                         HICKS
          (hiding it from him)
          Sore. Cut's still open.
          As Hicks hands the canteen back, Priest suddenly grabs his arm
          it's completely healed. Not even a scar.

                         PRIEST
          You're a halfbreed.
          A BEAT as Hicks looks to the ground, when he speaks, it's in
          a voice just below his breath.

                         HICKS
          My grandmother... she was raped. Nobody
          knows -- It's recessive in my family. No

          I woulda told you...just didn't want you
          treatin' me no different.
          It hangs there. the'silence stretching like a rope,then
          Priest REVS his cycle; a flurry ofdust kicking up as he speeds
          away. HOLD ON HICKS -- Eyes stinging, he watches Priest.
          Finally he starts his bike, following.

          B. A PAIR OF CRACKED BLACK GOGGLES half-buried in the dust.
          The kind used by a motorcycle rider.

          Priest and Hicks' BARRELING through the dust. Up ahead,
          something materializes in the desert --

          A TIN STRUCTURE
          Must be a mirage. Hicks blinks, can't believe his eyes. It
          looks abandoned.

                         HICKS
          Gotta be a desert rat.
          They park their bikes about twenty feet from the rickety
          structure, Hicks stepping off his bike and approaching.
          Carefully.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Let me do the talkin'. The sun has a way
          of cookin' these people's brains so they
          ain't quite right -
          BANG! A rifle shot kicks up dust at Hicks' feet.

          VOICE (0.3.)
          Hold it right there, mistert
          Hicks freezes.
          A BEAT as. the front of the shack shows only a doorway hidden
          in shadow...thenan OLD MAN emerges, Rifle in hand. He COCKS
          it, making a bead for Hick's head.

                         OLD MAN
          Take another step and you'll be meetin'
          the Lord directly.

                         HICKS
          Easy now old timer. I'm a sheriff.
          The old man snorts, spitting a thick stream of tobacco,. it
          sizzles when it hits the dust.

                         OLD MAN
          Ain't no law out here but my own.
          Calm and cool, Priest shifts in his seat, drawing his gaze.

          THE MAN'S EYES WIDEN
          Seeing Priest clearly now for the first time.

          Praise The Lord.
          Total attitude adjustment. He lowers the Rifle and smiles --
          revealing a gap tooth smile wide enough to drive a herd of
          cattle through.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. TIN SHACK - DAY

          A dusty PHONOGRAPH playing a recording of an old-time
          spiritual, the record warped from the heat, distorting the
          voice as THE CAMERA PANS PAST hundreds of homemade CRUCIFIXES
          haphazardly nailed across the wall.

                         OLD MAN
          Cleaned the place up a bit. Been years
          since I had any kind of company 'sides
          jackrabbits but I knew you was comity' --
          Dreams don't lie.'
          Ignoring Hicks, the old man pours BLACK TEA into a rusty can,
          handing it to Priest.

          OLD MAN (CON'S I D)
          Most people don't remember what you folk
          done -- Don' t WANT to remember. But I
          do. I know what you can do.
          (making the sign of the cross)
          You are God's mighty sword fused into
          flesh. One of the chosen.. Touched by
          His very ha nd so peace could finally come
          to this cur sed land.
          Hicks snorts.

                         HICKS
          Sounds like a bunch of religious mumbo
          jumbo to me.
          The old man stares fixedly at Priest.

                         OLD MAN
          Now you tell the Clergy this here is an
          authentic miracle, I want it registered.
          It's mine.

                         PRIEST
          Miracle?

                         OLD MAN
          The Angels. Never seen so many loot
          souls, breaks my heart just to think of
          it. This ain't no place for nothin'
          divine.
          The man's fevered belief unsettles Priest, he's unsure how to
          respond.

                         PRIEST
          You saw angels?

                         OLD MAN
          Sure as chit.

                         PRIEST
          How many?

                         OLD MAN
          Don't know, too many to count. Hundreds.
          Thousands. Some nights the sky was so
          thick you couldn't see the stars.
          His eyes suddenly light up, remembering something.
          i OLD MAN (CONT'D)
          Here! Look at this --
          He goes to a shelf, it's been turned into a MAKESHIFT SHRINE --
          rw=ging through a jumbled collection of crucifixes, yellowed
          photographs, collected junk.
          He pulls out a GLASS JAR containing SOMETHING MISSHAPEN
          floating in murky water, the old man proudly showing it to
          Priest and Hicks.

                         HICKS
          What is it?

                         OLD MAN
          It's their spoor! They'd be flyin' above
          and this stuff would drop from the sky
          like manna.

                         HICKS
          That's angel shit?

                         OLD MAN
          Scooped it up myself.
          (offering it to Hicks)
          You wanna hold it?
          Hicks backs away, shaking his head.

          OLD MAN (CONT'D)
          Suit yourself.
          Priest still doesn't know what to make of the man but he
          senses something to be gained. He tries changing the subject.

                         PRIEST
          These angels...di.d you ever see them
          during the day?

                         OLD MAN
          No, I reckon'. that's when they'd go back
          home for some shut eye -- Gettin' the
          world ready for the rapture takes a lot
          of work. Praise God.

                         PRIEST
          Home?

                         OLD MAN
          The castle -
          .:,He:points out the window, far away, atop a craggy peak sits
          the -remains of a CASTLE --

          OLD MAN (CONT'D)
          Beautiful place. Wonder of the world. I
          used to watch `em every night, takin' to
          the sky in all of God's glory,

                         (LEANS FORWARD)
          I never would disturb `em though. God's
          children like their privacy.
          He winks, smiling that crazy smile. Priest considers the
          possibility of a lead here -- but Hicks just gazes at the old
          man like he's nuts as we CUT TO:

          EXT. TIT' SHACK - LATER

          The boys mounting up their bikes, about to head out. The old man
          approaches Priest.

                         OLD MAN
          Wait! I want you to have somethin'
          before you go
          He presses a HOMEMADE CROSS into Priest's hand. It's a real
          beauty, flecked with colored stones. A lot of love and care
          went into this one.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

          OLD MAN (CONT' D)
          Remember, a man comes into this world
          with one thing. His soul. He's lucky if
          he's still got it when he leaves.
          Priest pockets the cross, REVVING his cycle and with a final
          nod -- he and Hicks speed into the wasteland. The old man
          watches, his cracked face squinting as the sun flashes off
          the metal of the machines.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. DUNKIRK RAIL (WASTELAND) - DAY

          The vampire train shooting down the track, blown tumbleweeds
          catching the scrub brush as it races by.

          INT. TRAIN CAR - SAME TIME

          Lucy is on her knees, scratching her nails against the wood
          floor. Testing it. Splintery shards come up in tiny clusters.
          From outside,.:the sound of a padlock opening, a chain
          dropping to the floor. Lucy quickly sits, making innocent.
          A SERVANT FAMILIAR enters, carrying a tray of food, his eyes
          grotesquely roam Lucy's body.
          Lucy smiles sweetly, taking the tray.

                         LUCY
          Thank you.
          The Familiar turns to leave.
          WHAPI Lucy SLAMS the tray over his head and he collapses to
          the floor.
          She makes a run for it. But the Familiar manages to grab her
          ankle.knocking her down, she kicks at him as he holds fast,
          hissing.
          Two more FAMILIARS run in and grab her arms, wrestling her to
          the floor. She struggles furiously but it's no use, she
          screams as we CUT TO:

          EXT. CASTLE - LATER

          A sad collection of crumbling stone walls and turrets. All the
          more surreal for rising up in the absolute nothing of the
          wasteland.

          55.
          Priest and Hicks stand, surveying the ancient ruin. Hicks
          can't help but laugh.

                         HICKS

                         (SARCASTIC)
          Yep. Truly a wonder of the world...good
          thing we listened to the fossil. Don't
          know how we'd find Lucy without him.

                         PRIEST
          Vampires sometimes use abandoned
          structures as a perch.
          (looks at Hicks)
          Watch for booby traps.
          And with that he enters the--

          EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

          Desert shrubs sprout like weeds between the stones, once
          proud turrets rotting to dust, everything bleached by the
          weather. Whatever this place was -- the desert owns it now.

                         HICKS
          Why we listen' to that crackpot? Crazy
          fucker's so blinded by faith he's
          batahit. That's called a zealot in my.
          book.

                         (BEAT)
          I'm startin' to think you might be one
          yourself. You ever think bout that?
          Priest doesn't respond, squinting his eyes.
          At the opposite end of the courtyard is an opening. It
          leads into a CHAMBER of some kind.

          INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

          Musty. Cool. Dark. Walls rising high into a cone as
          sunlight streams in from an opening in the top. Hicks and
          Priest enter, stepping carefully over PILES OF (GARBAGE
          littering the floor.

                         HICKS
          This is bullshit. Lucy's been gone five
          days'-- every stupid minute we waste here
          is a minute more she gets farther-away.
          Priest turns and sees a STONE STAIRCASE, uneven steps leading.
          downwards...too dark to tell where though.

                         PRIEST
          Stay here. If anything comes up the
          steps that isn't me -- Shoot it.
          Before Hicks can reply,.Priest heads down the stairs, darkness
          swallowing him with every step.

                         HICKS
          Great.

          DOWN THE STAIRS
          The air seems thicker here, the darkness claustrophobic.
          Enveloping. It takes a moment for Priests' eyes to adjust.

                         A CATACOMB
          Actually more a cave. Miles and miles. Twisting, jagged and
          moist. Endless corners, weaving into a dark and hideous maze.
          Priest heads into it

          INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAME

          Frustrated, Hicks kicks at the garbage.
          There's something underneath.
          He brushes aside the refuse, uncovering a . bunch' of SMALL
          WHITE SHAPES, breath catching as he realizes what it is:
          Bones.

          INT. CATACOMB - SAME

          It's quiet.
          Priest moves through the darkness, footsteps not even a
          whisper, heading deeper and deeper into the labyrinth as

          INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAMB

          Hicks is now at the chamber wall,'running his hand along it,
          feels grooves lining its surface.
          Stepping back, he sees they form an image-of some kind. Hard
          to make it out in the darkness.
          He leafs through the garbage, pulling out a piece of BROKEN

                         GLASS AS

          INT. CATACOMB - SAME

          Priest turns a jagged corner and looks down the longest, most
          narrow tunnel yet. A light shines at the end. A TORCH.
          Flickering gently.
          A SHADOW brushes past the light, moving so fast it barely
          registers. Could just be a trick of the eye. Or not.
          Priest moves towards it.

          IT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAME
          Hicks angles the broken glass under the light, reflecting a
          faint beam onto the wall, revealing a HUGE CARVING cut into

                         THE STONE:
          1L0Z.J.PIf .! i
          Primitive but very creepy. We linger on the image, the
          terror of the people, the viciousness of the creature. Truly
          horrific.

          INT. CATACOMB - SAME

          Quiet. Just the low how], of a breeze moving through the
          tunnel.
          Priest walks into an ANIMAL PEN of sorts, a hay-like
          substance covering the floor, the smell of something bestial.
          He,covers his nose, looking around, something in the corner
          catching his eye ---

                         TWO BODIES
          splayed across the ground like rag dolls. He crouches to
          take a closer look...

          WHAM!
          SOMETHING. barrels into him with superhuman force!
          Acting on instinct, Priest FOLDS AND ROLLS. Kicking the
          thing off him and PUSHING off the wall for a blistering
          recovery.
          Whatever it is, it's fast. Quickly countering for every move
          he gives, neither able to get the upper hand. Too dark to
          make out what it is.
          Priest locks his arms around the shape's arms, SLAb24=G it
          against the wall, illuminating it under the torch light.

          say. The cross tattoo covers her face, shadowing fierce
          eyes. Every inch a warrior.
          Time seems to stop for these two. Their whole dark history
          their bend -- passing between them in one glance.

                         PRIESTESS
          How did you find me?
          Priest doesn't reply. She narrows her eyes, suspicious.

          somewhere.

          They're interrupted by the sound of GUNFIRE echoing off the

          SOMETHING is lurking. A hulking shadow, sounds like a rabid
          bull. We catch the TIP OF A CLAW scraping at the stone floor.
          Priest approaches from down the tunnel, senses on full alert.

          the two warriors bound

          UP THE STEPS
          Charging into battle. Priest BURSTS from the stairway
          LEAPING up and over as the Priestess rolls off to the side.
          He-lands beside her, the two turning to face down --

                         THE VAMPIRE
          A fearsome creature -- much more terrifying than the
          Nightshade variety. Bigger, more ferocious. The ancient
          cousin to the more modern vampire.
          The beast opens its mouth and lets loose with a SCREAM, its
          breath vile.

                         THE PRIESTS
          Split up. The Priestess LEAPING to the stone wall and
          climbing up the rock. Priest goes the opposite way, ROLLING
          across the floor, keeping low.

                         I

                         THE VAMPIRE
          With a screech, goes for the Priestess. Crawling up the wall,
          hunched like a rat, talons ferociously . digging, into: rock.
          Coordinating an attack wordlessly, the Priests make their move:

                         THE PRIESTESS
          Lets go of the wall, PLUMMETING straight towards the vampire,
          the creature FLASHING its fangs in anticipation.

                         PRIEST
          Leaps from below, darting up the rock, taking advantage of
          the distraction, landing on the creature's back and wrapping
          his arms around its neck. Going for the deathlock.
          With a SHRIEK the creature WHIPS its head with crack force
          sending Priest flying. The Priestess, still in mid-drop,
          CATCHES him and they both hit the ground with their feet.

                         PRIESTESS
          Should we lead it into open air? More
          room to. maneuver.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         PRIEST
          Better to keep it contained.
          The vampire's lathered into an animal frenzy now, wailing and
          scuttling around the circular wall in crazy patterns.
          Suddenly -- with a stone shattering BOOM! it BURSTS through
          the hole, FLYING out into the night.

                         PRIESTESS
          Or not.
          They race outside.

          EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

          The Priests look up to find the vampire clawed around a
          turret, shadowed in the moonlight.
          WHOOSH!. Great leathery wings unfold from its back as it
          SWOOPS low, coming in for the'kill.

                         PRIEST
          Darts behind a boulder just in time. The creature's talons
          SCRAPING at the rock before it soars back to the sky,
          He pulls out his bible, grabbing and tossing a handful of --

                         THROWING CROSSES
          CUTTING through the air, sparkling in the moonlight,
          beautiful. BUT
          They BOUNCE harmlessly off the creature's wings, knifing back
          to the ground, imbedding deep in the stone, Priest having to
          nimbly: dodge his own weaponry.
          THE CREATURE HOWLS! Blazing straight for him.
          Undaunted. Priest looks at the Priestess and folds his hands
          into the prayer position, leveling his breath, pulse slowing
          as the screaming beast bares down like a freight train!

                         THE PRIESTESS
          Quickly scoops up TWO LARGE ROCKS -- HURTLING them towards
          the vampire. HER EYES LOCK WITH PRIEST'S as she too folds
          her hand, into the prayer position.

          RY âNG GOES BLACK
          Silence. Then --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          The sound of a heartbeat.
          The juncture between instants. A fissure.
          A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see Priest LEAPING through the air --
          EVERYTHING AROUND HIM FROZEN -- the creature, the rocks, the
          Priestess.

          EVERYTHING GOES BI CK
          A BRIGHT FLASH again -- and now Priest is using the frozen
          rocks as STEPS -- LAUNCHING his body until he is above the

                         CREATURE --

          ï¿½1ï¿½_ M, .Q
          A BRIGHT FLASH again -- and now Priest is ON the behemoth, he
          pulls out the FAMILIAR'S KNIFE, twirling it in his hand --
          EVERYTHING GOES BLACx
          And WHAM1 we fuse back into real time as the creature CRASHES
          to the ground. Its DECAPITATED HEAD rolling to a stop, face
          frozen in a horrible rictus.

                         A BEAT

                         O
          as the world seems to hold its breath then --
          Priest lands in a crouch, dropping next to the Priestess, her
          hands still locked in the prayer position. She turns to him.

                         PRIESTESS
          Not bad.
          Suddenly the CREATURE'S BODY erupts into ablistering death
          spasm! Talons clacking like STRAIGHT RAZORS, flailing
          dangerously close to the two of them.

                         BAMI
          A single bullet. pierces its heart and the body collapses with
          a THUD. Once and for all -- dead.
          ANGLE ON HICKS in the archway, smoke coming off his gun. He
          looks at the Priests.

                         HICKS
          Point A...meet point fuckin' B.
          He smiles, twirling his six shooters back into their holsters.

          EXT. COURTYARD - LATER

          Hicks examining the fallen creature, poking at the carcass
          with his gun. In some crazy, distant way he's related to
          this thing.
          He raises his hand, comparing it to the beast's talon.
          Shakes his head.

          ATOP THE CASTLE WALL
          Priest and the Priestess stare out at the Wasteland,
          uncomfortable with looking at each other.

                         PRIEST
          This was a Pureblood.

                         PRIESTESS
          we both know that's impossible -- They
          haven't existed for a millennium.

                         (BEAT)
          What's going on here?

                         PRIEST
          .I don't know.
          A BEAT filled with awkward silence -- when the Priestess
          ktï¿½ speaks it comes as a relief for both. An unloosening of
          things long held tight.

                         PRIESTESS
          Sector Seven was the only place I could
          find work. Waste Management.

                         (BEAT)
          Nobody else would hire me. %No
          applicable skills.&

                         PRIEST
          I heard that one too.

                         PRIESTESS
          A week ago, a family camping out on the
          Perimeter approached me --.Told me
          vampires were terrorizing their village
          and that the government wouldn't do
          anything about it.

                         PRIEST
          Did you go to The Clergy?

                         PRIESTESS
          They wouldn't see me,

          64.

                         PRIESTESS (CONT'D)
          By the time I got to the village it was
          completely razed. Nothing left. Women.
          Children. All dead ...they didn't even
          bother to feed.

                         (BEAT)
          I've been on their trail ever
          since...could be the same group who took
          your niece.

                         PRIEST
          Could be.
          The Priestess glances towards Hicks.

                          PRIESTESS
          Does the lawman know what you'll do if
          you find her?

                         PRIEST
          He knows.

                         PRIESTESS
          He'll try to stop you.

                         PRIEST
          He won't be able to.
          She pauses a moment, regarding him.

                         PRIESTESS
          You know, some nights I still dream we're
          back on the frontlines ... I wake up, I'm
          sweating... my muscles all clenched like
          I'm ready for something -- But I don't
          know what.

                         PRIEST
          Me too.

                         PRIESTESS
          Nights like that ...I don't go back to
          sleep.

                         (BEAT)
          But on other nights ...the good nights
          I dream about other things.

                         PRIEST
          ..Like what?

                         PRIESTESS
          You.
          Priest stares at her, not sure what to say. Lucky for him,
          the moment gets interrupted by --

          The warriors lock eyes, knowing something's been started --
          but.unsure of what.
          They head down the stone steps.

          EXT COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER
          Hicks is lifting up one of the creature's wings. There's
          some sort of BLACK MARK on its skin.

                         PRIESTESS
          it must be a birthmark of some kind.

                         HICKS
          That ain't no birthmark -- it's a brand.
          The Priestess studies the mark, something about it making her
          skin crawl. Maybe because it's in'theshape of a top hat.

                         PRIESTESS
          There's something else you need to see...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. ,CATACOMB

          Carrying a torch, the Priestess. leads Priest and Hicks
          through the maze, the deeper they go the more subterranean it
          feels. Bowels of the earth.

                         PRIESTESS
          I found this just before I was attacked -

          AN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER
          Huge. Cavernous. Our group appearing as tiny shapes set
          against the awesome scale of the place. Hundreds of LARGE
          HOLES gouged into the walls, stretching as far as torchlight
          allows. An incredible sight.

                         PRIEST
          It's a tomb. Big enough for an army.

                         HICKS
          Guess they're not as endangered as
          everyone thought.

          0 But where'd they go?.
          We hear a LOUD SHRIEK - and a MASSIVE SWARM OF BATS sweep
          through the depths of the chamber, black wings fluttering.

                         PRIEST
          Only one way to find out...

          INT. CAVE - LATER

          Our group moving deeper into the dark cavern, a moan of wind
          echoing off the gorge wail behind them, massive black
          stalactites hanging overhead. Very creepy.
          They move quickly, Priest ahead of the other two. Hicks
          gazes at the Priestess, admiring her body. Any man would.
          He works up his courage and approaches her. Quietly.

                         HICKS
          Are Priests allowed to, you know...have
          relations?

                         PRIESTESS
          We take a vow of celibacy at inception.
          Hicks can't be sure -- did she just look at Priest when she
          said that?

                         HICKS
          Look...I was uh, wondering --. how did he
          do that little stunt back there?

                         PRIESTESS
          All Priests can do it.

                         HICKS
          Including you?
          She nods.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          So what's the trick?

                         PRIESTESS
          No trick. You just have to remember.

                         HICKS
          Remember... what?

                         PRIESTESS
          Time is relative.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          Priest snaps up his hand, cutting off their conversation,
          something strange up ahead -- He slowly moves forward, the
          tunnel sharply dropping, feeding into a --

                         HUGE CHAMBER
          Not like the cave, this is more earthen. Like the inside of a
          wasp nest, curved walls made of dirt and spit, Priest covering
          his nose and mouth as he's hit with a massive stench.

          A GIANT SHADOW
          Looms before him, we_don't see what it is.
          As the Priestess and Hicks enter the chamber, Hicks coughs,
          reeling from the smell, the Priestess wrapping a cloth around
          her mouth -- the CAMERA focusing only on theirexpressions as
          they take in the horrible spectacle before them.

                         PRIEST
          You said the next nearest town was
          Jericho.

                         HICKS
          Yeah.

                         PRIEST
          Then we better go see.

                         HICKS
          . See what?

                         PRIESTESS
          -- What they left of it.
          PUSH IN ON HICKS -- knots of rope tightening in his
          stomach... only now realizing how truly black the path before
          him will be.

          EXT. DUNKIRK RAIL - DAY

          The NIGHT TRAIN thundering across the rails, almost obscene
          in the bright sunlight. An intruder from the darkness
          We hear a SCRATCHING sound, something scraping. Heavy
          breathing as we MOVE INTO...

          INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - SAME

          THE SERVANT FAMILIAR slides the door open, carrying food for
          Lucy, no tray this time.

          But she's not there.
          He SCREECHES, dropping the-food as he runs to a HOLE ripped in
          the wood floor, smatterings of blood around the edges. It's
          not very big, just enough for a small body to fit through.
          The Familiar sticks his head through the opening and -,-

                         RAILROAD TRACKS
          CLACK past at a furious speed, inches from his head! The
          noise is deafening..

          LUCY (0.S.)
          Hey...
          The Familiar turns -- Lucy's perched inside one of the JOISTS
          lining the underside of the train.
          KRACKI- She lets loose with a well-placed KICK, snapping his
          head back so he catches on the track. With ascream, he's
          quickly SUCKED out the train, pulverized on the track.
          Lucy's covers her mouth, her nails an ugly bloody mass.
          She's come this far, time to go the rest.
          She manages to carefully crawl from joist to joist, moving
          along the underside of the train, her body just centimeters
          from the passing track.

                         OHB SLIPS
          Catching herself just in time. Her eyelids practically
          brushing the wood.
          Taking a deep breath, she manages to hoist herself through
          the rest of the way finally making it to the CABOOSE.
          She pulls herself up onto the back of the car. Now what? The
          train is blazing past the wasteland at an incredible speed.
          Only one thing to do.
          She makes the sign of the cross, closes her eyes and JUMPS

          EXT WASTELAND (EDGE OF THE PLAINS) - DAY
          A dustorm.
          The plain's a shifting veil of sand, parting to reveal a
          vista of dunes, wind shipping across them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          As quickly as it opened the veil closes again, shifting to
          reveal OUR TRIO plowing through, blast goggles and
          respirators covering their faces. The Priestess riding a
          cycle identical to Priest's.
          In the distance we can make out a cluster of structures as
          they arrive at Jericho.

          EXT. JERICHO - DAY

          Riding into town. The storm making it difficult to see
          anything as they idle onto main street. It's deserted -- The
          only sound a saloon door creaking noisily in the wind.
          Ominous signs left in the vampires' wake are everywhere --

          BROKEN DOORS, SHATTERED WINDOWS, OVERTURNED VEHICLES.

                         PRIEST
          We separate. Go through each building,
          see what we find.

                         HICKS
          I'll start with the sheriff.

                         PRIESTESS
          Be careful. Just because it's daylight
          doesn't mean it's safe.
          Hicks nods, tightening the twin BANDOLEERS across his chest.

          EXT. JAIL DAY

          Everything is eerily quiet, just the sound of the wind.
          Hicks crouches just outside the door, examining SPENT SHELL
          CASINGS littering the walkway. He pulls out his six-shooter,
          pushing the door open with his gun, stepping inside --

          INT. JAIL CONTINUOUS

          The place is a mess.
          DUST BLOWN IN FROM THE STORM COVERS EVERYTHING, broken
          furniture scattered everywhere, glass littering the floor.
          Whatever went down here -- someone put up a hell of a fight.

                         HICKS
          'Damn.
          He shakes his head, heading towards the holding area as --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

          INT. BROTHEL - SAME TIME

          The Priestess walks in, flurries of yellow dust swirling in
          her wake, filling the room.
          if the jail was a disaster zone, this place is just plain
          creepy. Red sofas, red curtains, hell, even red wine.
          Everything set up for a great time...just no people.
          A PIANO sits nestled in the corner, she walks to it and runs
          her finger across the dust covered keys.
          It comes up wet and red. Blood.

          MUSIC SUDDENLY BURSTS FROM THE PIANO
          The plinking keys playing by themselves, activated by
          pneumatic pegs on a rotating paper roll, filling the lonely
          room with tin-pan music.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          The sound of a record skipping.
          Priest steps through a doorway, the door already ripped off
          its hinges. Broken furniture and glass.
          It's obvious a FAMILY lived here, children's clothes and
          wooden toys messily strewn across the floor.
          He walks to an OLD PHONOGRAPH sitting on the windowsill,
          still playing, placing the needle back in its cradle.
          That's when so=thing out the window ratchgo hiseve...

          EXT. JERICHO/MAIN STREET DAY

          Hicks, done searching, meets up with the Priestess in the
          middle of the street, he's pretty disturbed. Wind howling
          around him.

                         HICKS
          There ain't nobody left. Nobody.

                         PRIESTESS

                         (OMINOUS)
          Too many mouths to feed.

                         HICKS
          Where's Priest?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          But the Priestess's already focused on something else, gazing
          at something behind the general store. He turns to see what
          it is.

                         PRIEST
          On the ground KNEELING. Head down, engaging in some kind of
          prayer.
          THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as they slowly approach, wondering what
          the hell is going on. As they get closer they see the full

                         PICTURE:
          Before Priest are THREE LARGE WOODEN CROSSES, A NAKED BODY ON
          EACH, crucified. Because of the swirling sand it's hard to
          make out their faces but it's obvious the poor souls are
          already dead.
          Immediately the Priestess drops beside Priest, joining him --
          And it is only now that we get a good look at the crucifieds'

                         FACES
          They're Priests.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE WASTELANDS - DAY

          Bare feet running on the salt-flats.
          It's Lucy. Covered in dirt, battered and bruised but
          chugging along. There is absolutely NOTHING out here, only

                         LUCY AND

          A BLACK FIGURE DROPS SILENTLY FROM THE SKY BEHIND HER
          it wears a BLACK COAT, fluttering in the wind as it touches
          down, the fabric cascading across the earth in long dark folds.
          The Figure's face is completely covered by a BLACK COWBOY
          HAT. The only thing we can see is a CHEROOT Sticking out
          from where the mouth would be.
          A brief moment as the tip of the cigar glows, a puff of smoke
          exhaled. It drops to the ground, silver spurs making a
          slight CHING sound as a BLACK BOOT stamps it out.
          Lucy hears the sound and turns just in time to see -
          y I ATHICK CHAIN __SHOOTING OUT from within the Fiaure',
          coat. a HUGE METAL_ FINGERED CLAW at use ! The claw SLAMS
          into Lucy, thick fingers CLAMPING around her, knocking her to

                         THE GROUND

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          She digs her nails into the earth but it's no use as the chain
          DRAGS her backwards and she quickly-disappears INTO the coat
          with a SCREAM. The folds enveloping her in a dark embrace.
          In one graceful sweep, the Black Figure leaps to the sky.
          Quickly disappearing.
          We see the cheroot on the ground. Spent. The only evidence
          that anyone or anything was ever out here at all.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. JERICHO - DAY

          Caught between sheets of swirling dust and.sand, the images
          like hallucinations, moments of ritual and grief --
          A. The crucified Priests taken down from their crosses,
          their naked bodies like ragdolls.
          B. The corpses now wrapped in white cloth, carefully placed
          amongst the makeshift pyre.
          C. Flames engulfing the bodies, a twisty column of smoke
          rising, the sun and clouds painting the sky pink and gold.
          OUR TRIO stands before the pyre gazing into the fire, it Pops
          consuming more of the bodies, if the Priests listen close
          enough they can hear the end of an era.

                         HICKS
          Don't make no sense. What were they
          doin' out here?

                         PRIESTESS
          The same thing as us.

                         (BEAT)
          Someone's drawing us out.

                         HICKS
          Who?
          The Priests just stare into the fire, not having any idea.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          I imagine you'll have to go back to the
          Cities, inform the Clergy.
          A sudden silence.

                         PRIEST
          We're not going back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.
          The Priestess looks at him, he speaks for her as well but
          she's still shocked to hear the words out loud. A lifetime
          of conditioning..

                         PRIESTESS
          We'll burn for this.

                         PRIEST
          (looking at the pyre)
          We already are.
          Something in the flames catches the Priestess's eye, in the
          charred remains of one of the corpses -- SOMETHING'S GLOWING.
          She wraps her arm, plunging her hand through the bones,
          pulling out the object. Quickly, she tosses it into a'barrel
          of water. it hisses, steam rising as it cools.
          Priest reaches into the barrel, his hand emerging with a

          METAL SPIKE.

                         HICKS
          It's a railroad spike. My pop used to
          work boxcars before they shut down -- Why
          the hell would anyone wanna swallow that?
          A beat as Priest puts it together.

                         PRIEST
          He wanted us to find it. It's a clue.

                         PRIESTESS
          Where's the closest track?

          CUT TO.

          INT. JAIL DAY

          Hicks pulls a LARGE MAP off the wall, blowing off a layer of
          dust, drawing a line across the paper with his finger.

                         HICKS
          The Dunkirk Line. It starts all the way
          in the backcountry, bought the ore from
          the deep mines. There were about five
          stops along the route. I think.
          He draws several Xs along the line. His hand coming to a
          stop on a particular forboding PATCH OF MOUNTAINS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Looks like Jericho was, the last town it
          glances before'. heading around the Linwood
          Mountains...Then it goes to the last stop.

                         PRIEST
          Where?
          He draws one final X at the end of the line. Looks up.

                         HICKS
          The Cities.
          So there it is. The Priestess narrows her eyes.

                         PRIESTESS
          They must have been picking up different
          factions along the way. Moving during
          the day, feeding at night.

                         HICKS
          But headin' to the Cities is suicide.
          The sun will kill `em -- there's nowhere
          to hide.
          Priest gazes at the map, deeply troubled.

                         PRIEST
          They won't have to.
          And with the SHRIEK of the train whistle we CUT TO:

          EXT. WASTELAND (DUNKIRK RAIL) - DAY

          The Night Train barreling down the track, blasting along on
          its grim trajectory. Suddenly --

                         THE CAMERA
          Overtakes the train. Snaking along the rail at an incredible
          speed, leaving the train in its tracks (sorry) as it blisters
          across the Wasteland through craggy mountains and finally
          ending up in

          THE CITIES.
          And it is only now that we see exactly what Priest means.
          THICK CLOUD OF INDUSTRIAL SMOKE covers the metropolis.
          There is no sun.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. TRAIN CAR


                         V-)
          A BLACK COWBOY HAT coolly tilted down, exposing .a cheroot
          clutched between thin lips. A trail of smoke lazily floats
          upwards.

                         DARK FIGEMH
          A fine catch yes?
          (the voice is oily, a dark

                         WHISPER)
          She'd be dead if not for me...swallowed
          by the wasteland.
          We see Lucy on the floor at the Figure's feet, his pale hand
          runs calmly through her hair.
          From the shadows, Black Hat steps forward, looking down at
          Lucy. She struggles but the hand tightens its grip.

                         BLACK HAT
          What do you want for her?
          And now her captor lifts his hat -- revealing paper-thin
          skin, eyes like black coal. This is RUNE, a bounty hunter.

                         RUNE
          You know what r want.
          Black Hat's eyes flick upwards, glinting in the. candlelight.

                         BLACK HAT
          Don't. go too far, Rune.

                         RUNE
          He comes for her still.

                         BLACK HAT
          Of course he does.

                         RUNE
          Let me have him.

                         BLACK HAT
          No.
          Rune smiles,'revealing an impressive set of vampire fangs.

                         RUNE'
          I'm sure she'll fetch a nice price out
          In the zone -- they don't care what
          condition their meat's in...as long as
          it's easy to chew.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          Black Hat eyes him.

                         BLACK HAT
          Don't get involved in this.

                         RUNE
          I was involved long before you showed
          up.

                         (SEETHING)
          I've been waiting years for a chance at
          him...and now that he's here I find x
          have to ask a Prime permission...
          Like a snake, a finger of the claw emerges from the folds of
          his jacket, wrapping itself around Lucy's neck.

                         RUNE (CONT'D)
          My how things have changed.
          Ever so slightly, the metal finger SQUEEZES Lucy's throat,
          choking her.

                         RUNE (CONT'D)
          I never cared about your war. Never got
          Involved. Us halfbreeds. We were
          exiles -- rejected by both humans and
          vampires. All we wanted was a quiet
          place. But he wiped out my whole tribe.

                         (BEAT)
          Maybe it's time to return the favor.
          The metal finger wraps TIGHTEtR, Lucy gasps, the "tension
          becoming unbearable until finally

                         BLACK HAT
          Fine. He's Yours.
          As if on command, the finger retreats back into the jacket,
          Lucy COLLAPSING to the floor coughing and choking.

                         RUNE
          And -- she's yours.
          He laughs, sounds like a death rattle, dropping the cigar to
          the floor, spurs chiming as he walks out the car door, long
          dark coat fluttering behind him, disappearing into the night.

                         BLACK HAT
          Annoyed, picks up the still burning cigar, squeezing it in
          his hand. He turns to Lucy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         BLACK HAT
          And as for you uy dear...You're more
          trouble than I anticipated. Must be your
          uncle's blood in you.

                         (BEAT)
          A shame he'll never see what you'll
          become. I would've loved to see his face.
          And then he is upon her, saliva mixing with blood as he drinks.

          Ahead a forboding series of CRAGGY MOUNTAINS, awaits, a
          WINDING TRAIL criss-crossing through the peaks.
          They stop, their machines idling next to each other, taking
          stock of the huge task _beâ¬ore' them.

                         HICKS
          Beggar's Pass...it ain't gonna be easy.
          As if on cue the last rays of the sun wink out behind the
          mountain.

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS NIGHT


          QUICK SHOTS AS THEY HEAD DEEP INTO THE MOUNTAIN

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          Headlight crossbeams leading the way, their cycles navigate
          the twisty trail, cutting across sheer canyon walls, teetering
          on the brink of an abyss, rock slides a constant threat.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS CAMP - LATE NIGHT

          They've set up camp for the night on the lip of a ridge.
          Hicks and the Priestess sit by a fire dunking their feet in a
          nearby stream, the wear and tear of their journey evident on
          the sheriff's face.
          Priest lies close by, asleep.

                         HICKS
          If we push it hard we'll gain two days on
          'em. Should be enough to get us a jump.

                         PRIESTESS
          We'need more than a jump. We need a
          miracle.

                         HICKS
          That's the funny thing about time --
          He dips his hand in the water and raises it, letting the
          liquid leak from between his fingers.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          It's always runin' right through my
          fingers.

                         PRIESTESS
          You should try harder, sheriff.
          She cups her hand in the water, bringing it to her lips for a
          drink. Hicks smiles, leaning forward, something on his mind.

                         HICKS
          You ever regret it? Bein' a Priest?

                         PRIESTESS
          No.

                         HICKS
          What about a husband, children...A
          family?

                         PRIESTESS
          I've had a family -- just not the kind
          you're familiar with.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          Hicks glances at Priest.

                         HICKS
          What? You mean Mr. Laffs over there?

                         PRIESTESS
          He's not so bad once you get to know him.
          A beat, Hick's expression becoming serious.

                         HICKS
          He's going to kill her, isn't he? If.
          she's turned.

                         PRIESTESS
          Yes.

                         HICKS
          There's things that can be done. She
          doesn't have to die.

                         PRIESTESS
          She's his bloodline... and he's a Priest.
          It's the only way.
          Hicks tosses the rest of his food into the fire, troubled,
          but he knows there's no point in discussing it any
          further... for now.

                         HICKS
          And how many of you Priests are left now?
          A long moment before she speaks.

                         PRIESTESS
          Two.
          Hicks doesn't know what to Say-,,

                         HICKS
          .I'm sorry.,

                         PRIESTESS
          Yes.
          She nods, though in affirmation of what Hicks's isn't sure.
          He watches her as she stares'into the fire. We FADE TO BLACK:

          INT. VAMPIRE HIVE - DREAM SEQUENCE/FLASHEIACK

          It's dark.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          A GROUP OF PRIESTS (OUR TWO amongst them) move silently
          through a DEEP TRENCH, moist earthen walls rising around
          them, the air putrid with stink, mud clinging to their feet.
          Last: in the line, is a particularly FEARSOME PRIEST ...unlike
          the others, he's smiling, enjoying the action.
          As a cohesive unit, the Priests, climb up from the trench,
          scaling through the muck. They find themselves at the base
          of the hive, looking around at a chilling sight --

          THOUSANDS OF HONEYCOMBS
          stretching endlessly, rising high above in a cone. THOUSANDS

          OF SLEEPING VAMPIRES.
          OUR PRIEST, motions with his hand to the others, giving
          precise instructions, their movements well coordinated.
          He stops. Hearing a sound...a faint but incr.
          A BEAT as the Priestess looks at the others.

                         PRIESTESS
          They know we're here.
          From under the earth A HAND SHOOTS UP, grabbing onto a
          Priest's leg, pulling him down. Suddenly DOZENS OF VAMPIRES
          emerge, seemingly birthed from the soil. The warriors fight
          valiantly. Fiercely. But it's too much. Most are quickly
          cut down.

                         PRIEST
          Retreat!

                         FEARSOME PRIEST
          Battles like a tiger, grappling with TWo VAMPIRES, their claws
          at his throat, fangs inches from his face. A couple of quick
          moves and - before you realize how - the vanires lay dead.
          He quickly joins the surviving Priests as they run through the
          hive, a dizzying maze of MUDDY TUNNELS AND TRENCHES.

          FEARSOME SUDDENLY STOPS
          A BLACK TOP HAT lying on the ground catching his eye, must be
          the last remanent of a dandy gentleman. He picks it up,
          admiring the souvenir. Puts it on his head.
          The Priestess races by, shooting him a we don't have time
          for this' look. He STOPS her, grabbing her shoulder

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         FEARSOME PRIEST

                         (WINKS)
          What do you think -- Am I a "Dapper Dan"?
          She glares, running ahead to join the group. Fearsome just
          smiles, taking off the hat.

          FEARSOME PRIEST (CONT'D)
          Guess not.
          From within the hive comes a MIGHTY SHRIEK -- and now
          Fearsome starts to run, trying to catch the others as they
          scramble for daylight. The exit just in sight.
          At the last second --
          He's pulled back by a clutch of SCREECHING HUNGRY CLAWS. The
          hat still gripped tightly in his hand as he's dragged away.
          our two Priests reach for him but it's too late ...He
          disappears into the darkness as we CUT BACK TO:

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS CAMP - NIGHT

          Priest WAKING UP, breath catching in his throat.
          He looks over to find the Priestess working on her cycle,
          unable to sleep. There's a tension in the air, the sense of
          something about to break as he joins her.

                         PRIESTESS
          Why would the Clergy forbid us from
          seeing each other?

                         PRIEST
          Maybe they were scared of what we could
          do.

                         PRIESTESS
          Or what we would do.

                         (PAUSE)
          We both know there's something inside the
          Order that's off. Even if we don't know
          what it is.

                         PRIEST
          With or without the Clergy...we're still
          Priests. And we're the only ones who can
          stop that train.

                         PRIESTESS
          If we survive this we need to expose them
          for what they are.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         PRIEST

                         (PAUSE)
          We won' t survive this.
          She puts down her tools, staring fixedly at him.

                         PRIESTESS
          You scared to die?_

                         PRIEST
          No.

                         PRIESTESS
          I believed in Heaven my whole life.
          Believed everything we were taught -- And
          now...when it's finally my time...no more
          faith. They took it away from me.
          Priest gazes at her, trying his best to be comforting.

                         PRIEST
          Whatever happens. .. Wherever it is we go.
          We'll go together.
          At that.exact moment something inside Priest shifts just a
          little bit, a door opens -- never to be shut again.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          What in greater than God but more evil
          than the Devil? The poor have it, the
          rich need it -- and if you eat
          it...you'lldie.

                         PRIESTESS
          What?

                         PRIEST
          It's a riddle.
          The Priestess thinks about it.

          PRIESTESS.
          Nothing. That's the answer.

                         (BEAT)
          Nothing is greater than God. Nothing is
          more evil than the devil. The poor have
          nothing, the rich need nothing. And if
          you eat nothing... you'll die.
          It's said that warriors can become close friends only when they
          see each other's hearts -- Priest now knows this to be true.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         -PRIEST
          What you said before...about those nights
          when you were dreaming of me --

                         PRIESTESS
          The good nights.

                         PRIEST
          Yes. The good nights. Do you think
          maybe tonight...

                         PRIESTESS
          Could be one of those nights?
          She smiles.
          And then Priest does the most amazing thing. . .he smiles back.
          Things happen fast -- He finds himself planting his mouth on
          hers... the years of conditioning, all the ritual and
          tradition falling away in a flash.
          And it is here, together in this place, where they feel like
          they finally truly belong.
          The last two.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS, DAWN

          A blanket of mist covers everything in a grey haze. Morning
          has come.

          A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS
          As our trio forges onward and upward, the trail more
          treacherous with every twisty ridge, the overhangs looming
          ominously as they head deeper into the mountain.

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS - LATER

          The final climb.
          Yawning crevices, the wind moaning as it whistles between the
          canyon walls.
          Carefully they ride across DEVIL'S BRIDGE, a finger of stone,
          just wide enough for the cycles, on either side a straight
          drop to, oblivion. The peak of the mountain Just ahead.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          The Priestess is in front leading the charge, closely
          followed by Hicks. Priest brings up the rear, he stops just
          past the bridge, looks around.
          Something's wrong.

                         HICKS
          I- ee itl
          Hicks points, reaching the top of the mountain.

          IN THE DISTANCE
          A long black line snakes along the rail, puffs of heavy smoke
          lining its path; The Night Train.
          They're ahead of it. Barely.
          In his excitement, Hicks thunders ahead, starting the descent
          down the other side. The Priestess turns to shout back to
          Priest.
          But he's gone.
          Off her reaction we CUT TO:

          EXT. CREVASSE - DAY

          Tall rock walls flank Priest on. either side, the surrounding
          mist hanging in the air in cloudlike wisps. Slowly he walks
          through the canyon, senses fully attuned. It's quiet.

                         PRIEST
          I know you're there.
          A slight sound, the mist whipping into a pool as if something
          just moved through it. Priest quickly turns but there's
          nothing there.

          A GROUP OF ROCKS
          Tumble down the cliff. Again Priest abruptly turns
          but...still nothing there.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          Show yourself.
          A BEAT as he stands in the ether, waiting. Then --
          WHOOSH! Qurye -M
           onen. ieadjna straight-for pi=.

                         0

                         

                         

                         

                         

          $5.
          Just in time -- he DIVES, the claw BITING into a rock behind
          him, the chain quickly snapping back, disappearing into the fog.

          RU11TE (O. S. )
          (voice like the mist itself)
          I've waited a long time for this Priest.

                         PRIEST
          This isn't the time to settle old scores,
          Rune.

          RUNE (0. S. )
          I disagree... This is the perfer, time.
          WOOSH! Like lightning, the claw LASHES out, appearing from.
          nowhere. Priest JUMPS and it CHOMPS into the ground where he
          was standing. He lands on top of the chain, backflipping as
          it retracts back. Gearing up for another attack.
          RUNE (0.s.) (CONT'D)
          You've lost a step Priest...I never came
          this close before.

                         PRIEST
          I'm older now.
          We can almost bear Rune smile.

          RUNE (0.8.)
          Not me.
          And now THE CHAIN comes from a different direction, WRAPPING
          around Priest like a snake, the metal cutting into his body,
          snapping a ribt
          Yelling, Priest GRABS the chain, PULLING with everything he's
          got. Rune flies from the mist, dragged by Priest, crashing
          at his feet. The chain SNAPS and Priest BREAKS from the
          coils, grabbing Rune by the jacket, picking him up.
          Rune flashes his fangs and scissors his legs across Priest's
          stomach, the razor sharp roweled SPURS slicing his flesh,
          tearing the muscle, Priest SCREAMS, a hot rush of, blood
          staining the desert floor.
          Rune leaps away, landing ontop a boulder.

                         RUNE (CONT'D)
          You can't outrun the past, Priest... the
          things you did.

                         PRIEST
          It was a war, Rune.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         RUNE
          It still is
          He launches at Priest, duster fluttering like wings. The two
          grapple, Rune's fangs brushing Priest's neck.
          It's a savage battle, Priest's muscles and laser-like focus
          the only thing keeping him alive as Rune flies back across
          the canyon, landing against the rock wall like.a spider.
          Hunched, ready to strike BUT --

                         THE PRIESTESS
          Appears from within the mist, already in mid-leap, she lands
          beside Priest. The two together, a formidable presence.
          But Rune's a tough customer, he readies himself for another
          attack.
          ough h2 mist a single CLICKING sound.
          Rune looks over, sees --

                         HICKS
          Six-shooter pointed right at him.

                         6
          A beat as the two sides stare at each other in standoff. The
          air between them vibrating with energy. Crackling. Rune
          considering his options.

          RUNE (CONP' D)

                         (HISSING)
          Another time, Priest.
          He skitters up the rock face, disappearing into the mist.

          HAM!
          Hicks fires a single shot, the echo ringing through the canyon.

                         RUNE'S BODY
          Drops from the fog, hitting the ground with a thud. Dead.
          And now Hicks turns -- points his revolver at Priest.
          Catching both he and the Priestess by surprise.

                         HICKS
          Tell me you won't kill her.
          Priest doesn't reply.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Tell me...or I'll shoot you where you
          stand.

                         PRIEST
          Finally showing your true colors.
          A beat. The Priestess looks at Hicks.

                         PRIESTESS
          What's he talking about?

                         PRIEST
          He's a halfbreed.
          Hicks cocks the gun.

                         HICKS
          Don't turn this into somethin' it's not.

                         PRIEST
          You've been itching to do this since
          Nightshade.

                         HICKS
          She's your kin, goddamit!

                         PRIEST
          if she's turned...she's nobody's kin.

                         HICKS
          Things can be done. Things to lessen the
          thirst. She can have a normal life, she
          doesn't have to die.
          Priest nods grimly.

                         PRIEST
          It's our way.

                         HICKS
          And what is that? Some special Priest
          code of honor? You don't get it. Your
          "way' -- It's over!

                         PRIEST
          Shoot me and it won't matter if you find
          Lucy. You won't stop that train -- and
          you won't save her.
          The Priestess steps between them, looks at Hicks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         PRIESTESS
          He's right. We need to be together on
          this... it's the only shot we have.
          Hicks thinks about it, knows she's right. A tense beat then

                         HICKS
          This ain't done.
          He lowers his gun and walks away.
          The two warriors stand together, the Priestess gazing at
          Priest...hedoesn't return it.
          Without a word, he heads back to his cycle.
          She doesn't see as his hand touches his stomach.
          It comes up red.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS - DAY

          The Trio BLAST down the rock face, descending down the mountain
          at a furious clip. The Priestess looks at the train off in the
          distance, it's now much closer, passing the mountain.
          They've lost their edge.

                         HICKS

                         C'MONL
          He GUNS the throttle and his bike BLAZES forward, wheels
          thundering across the earth, the ROAR of engines filling our
          head becoming --

          EXT. DUNKIRK RAIL - SAME TIME

          The mad CLATTER of the train as it barrels down the tracks.

          EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS DAY

          The assault begins.
          Our trio finishes their descent, BLASTING onto the

                         SALT FLATS
          wheels kicking up sheets of sand and grit, spattering their
          faces. The train dead in their sites.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         HICKS

                         (SHOUTING)
          You think they see us?
          As if in response the locomotive belches a thick cloud of
          .black smoke, a door sliding open from one of the cars.
          A BEAT as everyone holds their breath, wondering what's going
          to emerge --

                         VR0000000000MI
          SIX BLACK MOTORCYCLES (the same ones who kidnapped Lucy) fly
          out from within the car! Vampires covered in rider leather,
          protected from the sun, heads obscured by BLAST HELMETS.
          Priest turns to the other two.

                         PRIEST
          Make sure you get on that train,

                         (BEAT)
          I'll catch up.
          'Before they can respond, he banks his cycle to the left.

          THE VAMPIRE RIDERS
          Take the bait, going for Priest. They gun their cycles,
          engines.WHINING as they rev forward, their LEADER unleashing
          a chain, swirling it above his head.
          With a SNAP he lashes it at Priest, the chain catching in his
          wheel, the sound of metal grinding as

                         PRIEST
          is thrown! His beloved bike FLIPPING across the desert in
          wild arcs. He hits the earth with a painful skid, using the
          momentum to roll back onto his feet.
          He checks his stomach, the wound's of enina t,}g xnorA, staining
          his shirt bright red. No time for first aid as he turns just
          in time to see

                         TWO RIDERS
          Throwing a STEEL CHAIN to the other, pulling the line taut,
          ready to take him out. Approaching fast.

                         PRIEST

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          At the last second, DUCKS, grabbing onto. the chain, swinging
          himself around in a graceful arc and KICKING his legs into a
          split. WHAM! his feet SLAM the two cyclists off their bikes
          and into the dirt.
          He lands back on the ground in a crouch, the steel chain
          tight in his grip -- Ready for battle.
          And he gets it.

          THE OTHER FOUR RIDERS
          Circle Priest, surrounding him, the ROAR of their engines
          like massive power drills.

                         PRIEST
          Snaps the chain above his head, bullwhip style, LASHING out.
          The sound of metal shredding as it tangles in Rider #1's
          handlebars, the bike SWEEPING into the other, CRASHING in a
          tangled mess.
          With a SNARL the fallen riders LAUNCH at Priest. These
          vampires are different than the Nightshade tribe. Stronger,
          quicker. Squat bodies of clenched muscles and fangs.

          A BRUTAL FIGHT
          Spinning, twisting, kicking, gnashing. Bodies locked in deep
          combat as Priest fends off the ferocious attackers. War
          cries WHOOPING, the OTHERS TWO RIDERS continue to circle the
          gladiators, dust kicking from their wheels.

                         PRIEST
          Rips the BLAST HELMETS off his two attackers. With a
          SCREECH, their faces burn, bodies instantly SLACKENING in the
          harsh sun.
          Priest CRUNCHES a vampire in the ribs, knocking the creature
          off his bike. In a flash, he FLINGS.a helmet into the
          housing of the last cycle, the bike nosedives, sending the
          rider across the desert.
          Eyes brimming with renewed fury, Priest picks up the cycle,
          VROOOOMI! GUNNING the throttle, mod. ROCKETING towards the
          train...

          EXT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - SAME TIME

          Hicks and the Priestess are riding right beside the colossus,
          the sound incredible as the cars rattle across the tracks.
          Carefully, they pull up to the caboose.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         PRIESTESS
          (shouting to be heard)
          You ready?
          Hicks nods, maneuvering to the side of his bike and jumping
          to the Priestess's, his cycle crashing into the dirt as he
          LEAPS onto the back of the train.

                         PRIESTESS (CONTIB)
          I'm going for the engine. Find Lucy.
          (about to speed off, stops)
          Before he does.
          Hicks nods, knowing this'll probably be the last time he sees
          her.
          And with that, she throttles forward, disappearing.
          Alone, Hicks takes a deep breath, looks at --

          THE TRAIN CAR DOOR
          Who knows what horrors lie behind it? He pops a WAD OF
          ATOMIC CRAW in his mouth and pulls his six shooters.

                         HICKS
          My.tuxn now, Priest.
          BAMI He kicks the door in

          INT VAMPIRE TRAIN CAR - SAME
          Sunlight bursts into the darkened chamber, but only reaching
          4 so far, as if the sun itself were scared to enter.
          Hicks rolls in, guns at the ready. It takes a moment for his
          eyes to adjust but when they do he finds a series of OLD
          WOODEN COFFINS stacked atop one another like cargo.
          He quickly moves through the car, careful not to disturb
          anything. We FOLLOW with him as he exits, entering --

          INT. BLACK STEEL ENCLOSURE - CONTINUOUS

          Designed so one can move between the cars without exposure to
          the sun, making the train a world of eternal midnight.
          Carefully, Hicks opens the next compartment's door.,.

          INT. TRAIN CAR - CONTINUOUS

          It's pitch black.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          The only thing we can make out is a LARGE CAGE, what's inside
          impossible to see in the darkness, just a GIANT HULKING C
          SHADOW. Its steady, hefty breathing letting us know whatever
          it is, it's asleep.
          Hicks covers his nose from the bestial smell, the cage taking
          up so much room he is forced to press himself against the
          bars, his body just inches from the thing inside.

          THE TWITCH OF BLACK LEATHER WINGS
          Makes Hicks stop in his tracks, silently praying to whoever's
          listening.
          A long moment...and then the steady breathing begins again.
          Whew. Hicks continues through the cabin, finally making it
          to the door as --

          EXT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - DAY

          The Priestess, engine at full boil, makes her way up the
          train, eyes on the engine up ahead.

          ACROSS THE BODY OF THE TRAIN
          A long line of tiny SLATS open up, RIFLE BARRELS quickly
          emerging, snapping into place with a click. BLAM! BLAMI
          BLAM! The guns FIRE AWAY, bullets blasting all around the
          Priestess, missing her by millimeters.
          She flicks down a TOGGLE SWITCH, there's a mighty roar, a
          massive surge of power and WHOOSH! she ROCKETS forward. The
          bullets chewing up the dirt behind her!

                         PRIEST
          Seemingly from out of nowhere, motors up to the train car
          riding the vampire cycle. He grabs onto a gun barrel and
          SWINGS into an arc, lifting himself off the bike and -

          EXT. TRAIN ROOF - SAME TIME

          Lands on the roof of the train. Hard.

          EXT. BELOW THE TRAIN - SAME TIME

          The cycle quickly ripped apart as it falls under the
          juggernaut, getting crushed, sparks flying off the rails.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

          EXT. TRAIN ROOF - SAME TIME

          Priest collapses against the metal, the strain beginning to
          wear, he blinks up at the sky, close to passing out.
          Suddenly a FIGURE steps in front of him, blotting out the
          sun. Priest squints, unable to trust his eyes, he must be

                         HALLUCINATING --
          IT'S BLACK HAT. He looks down at Priest, bowing with a
          slight flourish.

                         BLACK HAT
          "And the third day He shall rise again.
          Priest can't believe it, seeing his long dead comrade, his
          face etched with shock, all he can do is ask --

                         PRIEST
          .How?
          Black Hat smiles, baring hi fangs.

                         BLACK HAT
          Oh ye of little faith.
          The understanding hits Priest immediately, crashing over him
          like a wave.

                         PRIEST
          .They turned you.

                         BLACK HAT
          No, Priest...I turned them.
          He smiles wider as we CROSSCUT TO:

          INT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - SAME TIME

          Hicks still hunting for Lucy, making his way to the next car.
          He slides open the door, stepping carefully inside,
          candlelight softly illuminating the space.
          He's greeted by a sight that makes his blood freeze:

          DOZENS OF OPEN COFFINS FILL THE CAR
          Long black boxes lined in orderly rows, flickering light
          bouncing warmly off their mahogany casings -- The sound of
          DEEP TORTURED BREATHING lets us know the OCCUPANTS are asleep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         HICKS

                         0
          (under his breath)
          Shit.
          Gritting his teeth, he walks between the rows, quiet as
          possible. The interiors of the coffins are dark, hard to see
          what's lying inside, just that horrible breathing sound.
          As Hicks moves past, his body brushes the wood, the space so
          very tight.
          WHAM! The train CATCHES the rail and the car shakes,
          KNOCKING HIM INTO A COFFIN! Jarring it.
          He stops. Holding his breath...but
          Nothing happens.
          A quick Hail Mary (the man becoming more of a convert with
          every step) and he continues on.
          He doesn't notice as behind hi a PX rises from one of
          the, coffins

                         CROSSCUT TO:

          EXT. TRAIN ROOF -SAME TIME

          Priest and Black Hat eye each other, landscape whipping past
          at a furious rate, the train blasting along the tracks.

                         BLACK HAT
          Lost souls abandoned by divinity. No
          belief, no voice to guide them through
          the wilderness. Sound familiar?
          Priest doesn't reply, warily eyeing him.

          BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
          Lack of faith. That's what I found in my
          new brethren And so it was I
          discovered my true calling -- To teach.
          To lead.

                         PRIEST
          By murdering innocents?

                         BLACK HAT
          By drawing a once great race back to
          their"nature. By helping them discover'
          the mastery within themselves.

          who?

                         BLACK HAT
          Me.
          Something in the distance catches Priest's eye, a BLACK SPEC
          on the horizon -- It's The Cities. His jaw tightens, he
          knows there isn't much time.

                         PRIEST
          So this is how you go about it? One by
          one killing every last remaining Priest?

                         BLACK HAT
          It was the only way. The Cities are
          defenseless now...no one left to stop us
          from entering our Eden. But I was kind --
          I gave every last one the choice I never
          had.

                         (SMILES)
          Now it's your turn.
          Almost imperceptibly the two make a shift in their postures,
          the tension between the two warming up. Two warriors
          steeling for a fight.

          BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
          it's better to be with your enemies than
          to be alone, Priest. Humanity had its
          chance.

                         (BEAT)
          It's time to make way for new blood.
          Priest lowers his head, when he raises it, his reply comes
          easy and without hesitation.

                         PRIEST
          Yours.

          WE HEAR A HUM
          Molecules and electrons bursting from their orbits, the roar
          of the train gently subsiding as if the universe itself wants
          to leave these two room to battle.
          And before anyone knows it, they're already mid-fight. The
          SLAM and COLLISION of bodies giving way to the graceful sweep
          and echo of Priest combat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          Then as combustibly fast as it started -- the tableau drops.
          They stand, wind whipping around them in lethal currents,
          Black Hat having to shout to be heard.

                         BLACK HAT
          They taught us God created man in His
          image. . .but they lied. Man created God
          in a image -- And so, like man, God is
          weak. Corrupt. Merciless.
          He wipes away a streak of blood from his cheek.

          BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
          Who do you fight for, Priest? The
          Order's collapsed. The Church nothing
          but a line of decrepit, ruined old men.
          Charlatans.

                         (SMILES)
          How do you think I'm getting into the
          cities?
          Priest's face drops.

                         PRIEST
          I don't believe you.

                         BLACK HAT
          Your faith has failed you Priest.

                         (BEAT)
          Join me. Join me and have the best of
          both worlds --Walk in the sun. Stalk in
          the night. Why pray to a God when you
          can BE one?

                         PRIEST
          With ferocious instinct, he launches forward, feet digging
          into the metal.
          The two bodies COLLIDE w th Mic impact. Rolling across the
          roof, bodies twisting to the edge before FLIPPING onto the
          next car.
          The warriors rise, locked in a furious coil.as WHOOSHI train
          car after train car passes beneath them. Each leaping at
          j ust the right moment to land onto the next.
          But Priest is,outmatched.
          As they hit the final car, Priest flies across the roof
          catching the edge with his hand just before he goes over, his
          body dangling over the side. Exhausted and bloodied.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          Black Hat calmly approaches, his foot dangerously close to
          Priest's hand. The landscape below-whipping past at an
          incredible speed.

                         BLACK HAT
          Your problem is you keep looking to God
          for-your power -- But I know the real
          truth.

                         (BEAT)
          You've been praying to an empty sky.
          And now he SWIPES his foot across the roof, knocking off
          Priest's hand as one would swat a bug. Priest falls below,
          getting caught under the train and quickly dragged under.

          BLACK HAT (CONT' D)
          But you know that now.

                         CROSSCUT TO:

          EXT. TRAIN - SAME TIME

          The Priestess, cycle at full throttle, racing beside the
          TRAIN ENGINE. Up close it's a real mechanical monster, black
          metal and heat fused into a superpowered nightmare. The hull
          completely covered. Impervious.

                         MASSIVE PISTONS
          Pump up and down furiously, moving so fast they blur, turning
          the-giant DRIVE WHEELS that power the locomotive. ANGRY
          BLASTS OF STEAM vent whi te hot from between the wheels, just
          missing the Priestess.
          She reaches into her pack and lugs out a CROWBAR, pulling up
          to the beast and managing to stick it between the pistons
          hoping to jam up the works.
          The machine chews it up like candy.

                         CROSSCUT TO:

          INT. TRAIN COFFIN CAR - SAME TIME

          Hicks is almost at the door, hand reaching for the handle.
          He hears a RUSTLING sound and turns to look behind him...
          But there's nothing, just the open coffins.
          Turning back, Hicks catches his breath:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          A VAMPIRE hangs upside down from the ceiling, blocking the
          door. Its red eyes snap in anticipation, a shiny BLACK
          PROBOSCIS darting from its mouth!
          Hicks SPITS a wad of ATOMIC CRAW at the creature. It
          RIEKSI dropping to the floor, writhing. The sick smell of
          cooked flesh filling the car.

          HICKS LOOKS BEHIND HIM
          DOZENS OF VAMPIRES ARE NOW AWAKE. Sitting up in their
          coffins, the foul creatures all blood-eyeing Hicks like the
          dinner he most surely is.

                         HICKS
          Shit.
          With a WAIL, the vampires quickly scramble from their coffins,
          sharp talons scratching at the wood, snapping the planks.
          Desperate, he wrenches open the door, darting into --

          INT. STEEL ENCLOSURE - CONTINUOUS

          and manages to SLAM the door behind him just in time as the
          hungry beings CRASH against itl

                         A
          He wedges a knife in the door-handle, bashing it with his
          revolver, jamming the door trapped shut.
          He turns to head to the next car but there's a THICK CHAIN
          AND PADLOCK wrapped around the door, aWILD-EYED FAMILIAR
          peering out from inside the door window. Hicks SHOOTS the
          padlock but no luck, it doesn't break.
          He's trapped.

          THE DOOR BEHIND HICKS BUCKLES ON ITS HINGES
          It'll hold. . .but not for long.

          EXT. UNDERNEATH THE TRAIN - SAME TIME

          Priest is still alive. Barely.
          He hangs in tatters, desperately clinging to the
          undercarriage, face and body punched with bruises and blood.
          Jaw set, he begins to move through the undercarriage, hand
          over hand, every movement sheer agony.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          INT. METAL ENCLOSURE - SAME TIME

          Hicks stares at the door as it starts to BREAK from its
          hinges. He trains his gun on it, a feeble gesture --- but it's
          all he's got left.
          Then there's a horrible SCREECH.

                         HICKS TURNS
          The WILD-EYED FAMILIAR charges, attacking from behind, having
          unlocked the chain and opened the door. He SCREAMS, sinking
          a KNIFE in Hicks' side!
          Hicks spins, slamming his attacker in the nose with a palm
          heel strike, knocking the Familiar out instantly.
          Hicks pulls the knife out, blood flowering across his shirt
          as the vampires continue to PUMMEL the door behind, him.
          He trips over the chain and staggers into --

          INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - CONTINUOUS

          Collapsing to the floor, he presses his body against the door
          to close it.

          HIS EYES SEARCH THE CAR
          It's bare. Absolutely nothing in here. A single candle
          burns: ,on the floor, dimly illuminating the room.
          Weakly, he crosses the space and goes to the next door. This
          one's got a THICK PADLOCK too,.

                         HICKS
          'Dam.
          He site on the floor, breathing hard, knowing this is as far
          as he goes.
          Gradually another sound becomes audible. Hicks listens,
          nervous. He holds his breath straining to hear.
          It's someone else's BREATHING.

          IN THE CORNER
          A HUNCHED FIGURE sits...its back to him. Hidden'in shadow.
          Hicks levels his gun, slowly moving towards the shape, the
          candlelight giving him a glimpse of its face.
          He can hardly believe it

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Lucy?
          it is.
           That's when he sees something. Glinting in the darkness,
          just below her lip.
          Something sharp.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. VAMPIRE TRAIN - SAME TIME


          THE STEAM WHISTLE BLASTS
          Howling across the wasteland, the train now racing even
          faster, furnace cranking out flame like Dante's inferno, the
          Priestess furiously keeping pace with the engine, desperately
          looking for a way in.
          There is none.
          She looks up ahead.

          THE SKYLINE,OF THE CITIES
          Smudged like a greasestain, looms large across the horizon,
          right in the train's path.
          She squints up to the sky, analyzing the sun, making a quick
          series of calculationsin her head. Trajectory. Timing.
          Then she looks at the train. Smiles.
          She flicks the Nitros Toggle one last time. Her bike ROCKETS
          past the train engine, speeding into a curtain of dust.
          Disappearing...

          INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - SAME TIME

          Hicks crouches beside Lucy, his gun trained on her.
          She site listlessly, her skin pale, eyes lost on the wall in
          front of her.

                         HICKS
          Lucy, my name is Sheriff Hicks...I'm here
          to take you home.
          No response. She seems almost catatonic. He reaches into
          his pocket, pulling out her photograph, showing it to her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          I'm here with your uncle.
          That gets her attention, she looks at Hicks -- And she looks
          scared.

          WHAP!1
          The car door outside finally starts to give freely, metal
          breaking open. The sound of SQUEALING vampires.
          Hicks runs to.the car door, in one quick motion, SCOOPING up
          the chain and WRAPPING it around the handle, TYING IT TIGHT
          just as --

                         A TALON
          Reaches through the opening, long bony fingers swiping at
          Hicks like switchblades as he falls backwards, pain shooting
          up his body.
          ANOTHER ARM breaks through the small window, clawing at the
          air, the door BANGING REPEATEDLY against the chain.
          Hicks places himself between Lucy and the door, not noticing
          as she eyes the blood soaking through his shirt.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Stay behind me. I'll hold `em off as
          long as I can
          BLAMI BL.AM! Hicks FIRES, bullets peppering the creatures as
          they HOWL -- but they keep at it, the thick chain stretched
          tight, ready to snap.

                         ONE VAMPIRE
          Manages to scramble through, it charges at Hicks, fangs
          glistening. BAMI With a twitch, it collapses in a heap, a
          well placed bullet between the eyes.

          EXT.-THE CITIES - SAME TIME

          A MASSIVE GATE, not, opened for decades slowly GRINDS open, a
          complex series of CHAINS and WINCHES scraping to life. The'
          Cities now open to the approaching vampire train.

          EXT. TRAIN SAME TIME

          The SCREAM of the whistle like victory as the locomotive
          approaches the city limits, sending up a giant plume of
          billowing steam.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          The sky above already starting to cloud black as --

          INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - SAME TIME

          Hicks continues to FIRE, the vampires seconds from entering
          the car.
          He turns to look back at Lucy. But she's gone.

                         HICKS
          Lucy?
          WHAM! A WOODEN. PLANK slams him over the head, knocking the
          gun from his hand. Woozy, he spins around to find Lucy
          standing over him, holding the plank above her head.
          He scoots back just as WHAM! the plank comes back down again,
          splintering apart across the floor.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Lucy, wait
          She doesn't, jabbing at him with the broken plank, he dodges
          it, barely, but she keeps coming.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)

                         :71
          Lucy, don't do this!
          The girl's just too fast. She keeps pushing him backwards
          until he's dangerously close to the vampire's clawing hands..
          Hick's closes his eyes, knowing this is it...

                         A FIST
          PUNCHES through a BOARDED UP HOLE in the floor (the one
          through which Lucy escaped before), wood splintering into
          tiny shards.
          Hicks takes advantage of the distraction and SLUGS Lucy,
          knocking her unconscious.
          He dives for his gun, scooping it up and leveling it at the
          hole, ready to fire at whatever's coming through...

                         IT'S PRIEST
          He sticks his head through the opening, having been drawn by
          the sound of gunfire. Hicks can't believe it.

                         PRIEST
          (reaching for Lucy)
          Give her to me! Hurry!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          Hicks thinks about it, unsure.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          -- They'11.get through the door any
          second! Give her to mei
          Screeching, ANOTHER VAMPIRE makes it through the opening,
          Hicks quickly taking him down in one crack shot.
          He picks Lucy up, handing her to Priest.
          Priest disappears with her, Hicks climbing down behind just
          as -- the chain finally SNAPS and the door BURSTS open with
          screeching vampires!
          Hicks BLASTS away but there's too many of them, they keep
          coming. He drops into the hole --

          EXT. UNDERNEATH THE TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          Landing in the undercarriage. Coming face to face with the
          speeding track, everything shaking like an earthquake.

                         A VAMPIRE
          Jabs its head through the hole, teeth chattering-- but the
          creature can't go any further, the sunlight already making
          its skin smoke.
          On his back, Hicks worms his way down,. following Priest.as
          they climb up a LADDER attached to the side of the train.

          EXT. TRAIN CONTINUOUS'

          They work their way up the side, making it to the roof,
          exhausted. Priest carrying the still unconscious Lucy.

                         HICKS
          We should jump!

                         PRIEST
          Not until we stop the trains
          But now Hicks isn't even looking at him, his attention caught
          up in the horrible sight waiting ahead of them.

                         HICKS

                         (SWALLOWS)
          Too late.

                         THE CITYSCAPE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          t Towers above as the train approaches, so close the smell of
          sulphur and carbon clogs their noses.
          But that's when something catches Hicks' eye...up ahead on
          the tracks --
          Someone stands. awaiting the train.
          IT'S THE PRIESTESS -- Standing defiant as the train barrels
          towards her. An ant in front of a battleship.
          She sees Hicks and Priest-on top of the train, Lucy with them.
          Taking one last look at Priest -- she smiles.
          And spreads her arms open.

                         ON PRIEST
          Horrified, realizing what she's going to do...and powerless
          to stop her.

                         PRIEST
          What happens next happens fast:
          Priest GRABS Hicks, folding his body around both he and Lucy,
          hands coming together in prayer, feet leaving the train as --
          E ERYTH ggas BLACK
          The sound of a heartbeat.A threshold. A zone of transition.
          A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see the TRAIN collide with the.
          Priestess. The massive grill of the engine CRUMPLING AROUND
          HER as if smashing into a building.
          She doesn't move.
          A BRIGHT FLASH -- one by one the train cars SLAM into each
          other, the cars JUMPING the rails.
          MMMM gQES BLACK
          A BRIGHT FLASH -- and now Priest is falling through the air, his
          body shielding Hicks and Lucy, train care skipping across the
          earth, careening through the air.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          And WHAM! we FUSE back into real time as train cars CRASH
          down, sheets of dust clouding the sky in a roiling storm of
          debris and shrapnel, until finally...it all comes to a stop.
          It's quiet.
          We move through the swirling sand until we find --

                         PRIEST
          He stands, bruised and bloody, staring at the sky. Watching.
          A dazed Hicks beside him, Lucy in his arms as she comes to.
          A HORRENDOUS SCREECH fills the air.
          Led by the Purebloods, HUNDREDS OF VAMPIRES fly out from
          within the broken cars, taking to the sky in a massive black
          swarm, tangling together in flowing shapes. Beautiful.
          Terrifying.
          Then in one horrible instant --
          They TURN as if guided by an unseen hand, flying towards the
          Cities. Sensing the blood that awaits.

                         HICKS

                         (HORRIFIED)
          They're gonna make it.
          The creatures arctowards the metropolis,the city within

                         THEIR REACH:
          Priest studies the sky and all at once...he knows.

                         PRIEST
          No, they're not.

                         THE SUN
          PUNCHES through the teeming mass.
          A few rays at first, but then more and more,-cracking through
          the black tide like shattered glass.
          Hicks' eyes, widen, witnessing an amazing eight as the
          vampires' bodies collectively BLACKEN and SHRIVEL the swarm
          withering... quickly becoming nothing more than husks.
          Floating black kites.
          Hicks and Priest stand, surrounded by the epic destruction,
          fire and smoke casting everything in a surreal haze.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         HICKS
          You knew they wouldn't make it.
          A long time before Priest answers.

                         PRIEST
          She knew.
          He turns to THE ENGINE -- its grinning teeth grill CAVED IN
          as if smashed by the very hand of God.

                         THE PRIESTESS
          Lies before it. Somehow not a scratch on her...But
          something's wrong -- something inside her broken, something
          elemental. She doesn't have much time.
          Priest kneels beside her, taking her hand. Trying to be
          strong for her.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          Do you want me to?

                         PRIESTESS

                         O
          Priest lowers his head. The following having been spoken by
          him all too often.

                         PRIEST
          "You shall wash me and I shall be made
          whiter than snow. Glory be to the Father
          and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit...
          The words are heavy, each harder than the next.

                         PRIEST (CONT'D)
          -- As it was in the beginning, is now and
          ever shall be. World without end."

                         (BEAT)
          Amen.

          IN THE DISTANCE
          A FIGURE escapes through the dust, lurching towards the
          Cities,-- It's Black Hat.

                         PRIEST
          sees him but chooses to stay with the Priestess, brushing the
          hair from her face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         PRIESTESS
          I wish we could've had more time.

                         PRIEST
          .Me too.
          She reaches up, placing her hand on his chest.

                         PRIESTESS
          Wherever it is we go -- we go together,
          right?
          She smiles weakly... but Priest can see she's scared.
          He gives her one last kiss, cradling her body, sand circling
          them as she draws her final breath.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE WASTELAND - DUSK

          The sun setting on the horizon.
          A nearby PYRE consumes the last of the Priestess' body as Priest
          saddles up on a vampire bike, the flames rising behind him.
          Hicks approaches, Lucy huddled in a blanket, shivering.
          The two men exchange a look, the snap and flash of the fire
          reflecting in their eyes.

                         HICKS
          When you're finished -- You know where to
          find me.
          A tense beat then
          Priest GUNS the engine. Hicks and Lucy watching as he blazes
          towards the Cities, the sky above the color of hellfire.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. THE CITIES NIGHT

          The sound of a CHOIR.
          The soaring, ethereal tones carrying us through the forest of
          BRICK SMOKESTACKS-- finally coming to rest on A GIANT CROSS
          atop a mosaic BASILLICA, the colored tiles black with ash.
          We're back in CLERGY CITY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          INT. CLERGY CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

          Evening mass. The place is packed, every pew filled with

          WORSHIPERS.

          CROSSCUT TO.,

          INT. CLERGY CHAMBER - SAME

          Shadows and light.
          A cabal of MONSIGNORS stand shrouded in white robes, awaiting
          to be anointed by ORELAS. A private ceremony.

                         CROSSCUT TO:

          INT. CATHEDRAL - SAME

          A LINE OF CHILDREN kneel before the altar, the MONSIGNOR
          raising the Host, offering communion.
          He suddenly stops, his expression dropping as

                         PRIEST
          Slowly makes his way down the aisle, bruised and bloodied,
          his very presence a direct affront to this place. A woman
          GASPS, somebody faints.

                         CROSSCUT TO:

          INT. CHAMBER - SAME

          Orelas dips his hand in water, touching a Monsignor's forehead.

                         ORELAS
          Ecces Agnes Dei, ecces qui tollit peccata
          mundi.

          THERE'S A LOUD CRASH
          Everyone turns to see the massive chamber doors BURSTING
          inwards! THE BODIES OF TWO GUARDS skidding across the marble
          floor.

          PRIEST ENTERS THE CHAMBER
          A true force of nature now, coming like the Fourth Horseman.
          Grief and betrayal stoking his anger higher, a blaze igniting
          behind his eyes.

                         BLACK HAT

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          Steps from the shadows. Deep wounds line his face, the cross
          tattoo now gouged and distorted with blood -- He smiles.

                         BLACK HAT
          I'm afraid you're too late, Priest.

                         THE MONSIGNORS
          Shed their robes, revealing fresh BITE MARKS on their necks.
          Orelas' new-found fangs glint in the candlelight.

                         ORELAS
          And why shouldn't we live forever?

                         (HISSES)
          We're God's very voice. His vessel!

                         PRIEST
          Stands shell shocked, the level of betrayal staggering.

          BLACK HAT ATTACKS
          SLAMMING.into him, the two warriors going at it in a brutal
          battle, the vampire raking his claws across Priest's face,
          drawing blood.

                         PRIEST
          Sends him sailing through the air, Black Hat crashing into a
          collection of CANDLE HOLDERS, an ancient TAPESTRY catching
          fire, flames quickly spreading to the other fabrics -- The
          chamber erupting in an orange blaze!

          THE MONSIGNORS SHRIEK
          Bodies contorting in grotesque shapes as they BECOME.
          Black Hat stands triumphant, flames rising behind him.

                         BLACK HAT
          With them I can start anew! You can't
          stop it --

                         (SMILES)
          Must be God's will.
          He flies across the room, BARRELING into Priest with
          everything he's got, DIGGING a hand into Priest's wound.

          BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
          "I looked and beheld a pale horse and His
          name that sat on him was Death" --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.
          Priest coughs up blood. Black Hat smiles, wrapping a hand
          around Priest's. throat, LIFTING him off the floor, SQUEEZING
          the life from him,

          BLACK HAT (CONT'D)
          "And all hell followed with him."
          He raises his head back, ready to sink his teeth. Priest too
          exhausted to fight back. This is it.
          Prom a b= --

          THE GIANT GOLD CROSS
          Breaks from the wall with a GROAN, PLUMMETING towards them.
          Black Hat stops, his eyes snapping upward.
          At the last second --

                         PRIEST
          WRENCHES himself from,Black Hat's grip, tumbling. across the
          floor.
           WHAPI The cross S LM onto Black Hat, pulverizing hi !

                         Â¢
          Chunks of glass and stone rain down around Priest, the
          chamber starting to COLLAPSE. Diving, he barely makes it
          out, the rotunda .CRASHING down behind him.,
          The Monsignors lunge but Priest manages to jam the doors
          shut, locking them in. They BASH against the door, SHRIEKING
          horribly, the chamber now an oven.
          Priest presses against the door, it SPLINTERS all around him,
          the terrible sound RISING until finally
          it stops.

                         PRIEST

                         (WHISPERS)
          Forgive me.
          He collapses, making the sign of the cross.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CLERGY CATHEDRAL - MOMENTS LATER

          Complete chaos.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          PEOPLE stream out of the massive doorway, stampeding down the
          stairs, the giant structure enveloped in smoke and flame.
          Priest looks up to find FATHER KOEPPEN. The old man staring
          .at him. A lost soul.

                         KOEPPEN
          Am I next?
          Priest approaches -- Koeppen closing his eyes, ready for the
          blow he knows is to come.
          But Priest only lifts the man's head, studying his neck.
          He's clean.
          And without a single word -- Priest just walks away.
          When Koeppen opens his eyes, he's a new man -- a man absolved.
          With renewed energy, he looks to the crowd around him. And
          for the first moment in a long time ...He believes.

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)

                         (CALLING OUT)
          People don't run! God is here for youl
          He wants you to STOPI Stop and ask
          yourself a question
          And the people DO stop, looking to him, the panic leaving
          their eyes...

                         KOEPPEN (CONT'D)
          Ask yourselves -- Where am I going?
          At this, Priest turns, the question catching him as well.
          And it's only now he realizes --
          He has no answer.

          The windmill.
          Its rusty blades scrape along, the metal catching the first
          rays of the day.
          AARON PACE is already up, working on rebuilding his house.
          He stops, gazing off in the distance.

          ON THE HORIZON
          A cycle. Two black specs riding it. Hicks and Lucy.
          Dropping his tools, he runs to meet it.

          INT. OUTPOST 10 - SEVERAL DAYS LATER - NIGHT

          Time has passed. The moon shines through an open doorway.
          Lucy lies in bed, Aaron spoon feeding her a warm broth. He
          smiles, Lucy reluctant to smile back, still uncomfortable
          with her teeth.
          But eventually -- for her father...she manages it.

                         HICKS
          Leans against the backwall watching. Lucy glances his
          way... then shyly looks away.

                         AARON
          I can't thank you enough for what you've
          done, sheriff.

                         HICKS
          Just make sure she keeps on the tea.
          It's a special brew -- lessens the
          bloodthirst...something my granddad
          taught me.
          Aaron nods hopefully, squeezing his. daughter's hand.

          A full moon.
          Hicks stands on the porch, enjoying the breeze as he pops a
          wad of chaw in his mouth.
          A MOVEMENT out in the darkness catches his attention.

          IN THE DISTANCE

                         A FIGURE
          Stands astride a motorcycle, shadowed in the moonlight.

          113.
          Hicks approaches, the wind kicking up, whistling through the
          emptiness. Even though he can't see him -- Hicks knows who
          it is.

                         HICKS
          It doesn't have to be like this.
          Priest just stands, staring.
          Hick's hand curls around the revolver.
          Priest looks to the cabin, the challenge hanging in the air

                         THEN
          He steps from the bike, advancing towards Hicks.
          Hicks pulls his gun, leveling it.
          Priest keeps coming, the wind blowing harder as he
          approaches. A feeling of inevitability.
          Hicks stands his ground, cocking his gun.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          D= I t- -make dQ this.

                         PRIEST
          Stares into his eyes and --
          Something passes between them something so strong and
          personal it transcends emotion.
          Hicks FIRES!
          But Priest is pone.
          Hicks looks around --
          There's no sign of him, not even the bike.

          Sitting peacefully on the bed together, just as he left them.
          Aaron holds up the cup, turning it over.

          All done.

          Nothing to worry about, just a coyote.
          Aaron smiles, happy enough to be with Lucy.

                         AARON
          Well ...we're all God's creatures.
          Hicks turns, ready to leave, but something on the table
          catches his eye

          THE DESERT RAT' S HOMEMADE CROSS
          He picks it up, turning it in his hand, the colored stones
          0 catching the moonlight...How the hell did it get there?

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          Don't forget your cross -- It's
          beautiful.
          A flicker of a smile crosses Hick's face, realizing.

                         HICKS

                         ACTUALLY --

                         (BEAT)
          I think it's for you...and Lucy.

          Alone in the darkness, Priest sits on his cycle, his hand
          clutching the WELL-WORN PHOTO OF THE PACE FAMILY.
          His eyes shift, gazing into the distance at the outpost, a
          warm glow emanating from within the cabin.
          He places the photo in his pocket. The wind making a high,
          lonely sound.

          Priest streaks into the night, bathed in moonlight,
          desolation opening around him.
          He disappears into the emptiness.

          The vampire train.
          A car lies half-buried in the sand, mangled cage within.

          A BLACK CLAW
          Emerges from inside, clamping onto metal, something dragging
          itself out into the moonlight.
          It's a PUREBLOOD.
          With a SCREECH it takes to the night sky, massive black wings
          fluttering, arcing towards the twinkling metropolis.

          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          SUPER: April 27, 1973
          All is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny
          Friday afternoon. Cars idle in the driveway awaiting
          the three o'clock onslaught of liberated children.
          Two faded yellow buses stand ready.

          The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL.
          A swarm of children pours out the door and down the
          broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward
          the cars and the buses.

          Moving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND,
          nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway..
          Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub-
          dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the
          stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a
          girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old,
          two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in
          school. The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM
          HAMMOND, also eleven, Robin's older sister.

                         ALEX
          C'mon, Robin.

                         ROBIN

                         (STUTTERING BADLY)
          W-w-where's D-d-daddy?

                         ALEX
          He's got a meeting at the high
          school. We're supposed to walk
          home with Kim...
          (sees Robin watching
          the young couple)
          She's too busy. Let's go
          by ourselves.

                         ROBIN
          N-n-n-no, Alex. Let's w-w-wait.

                         ALEX
          Why?
          Robin is staring at Nick. Alex looks, understands.
          He's angry.

                         ALEX

                         (CONTINUING)
          You're crazy, I'm not waiting.

                         CONTINUED :
          He strides away. Robin's eyes remain on Nick and Kim.
          Nick says something to Kurt. She shakes her head and
          pains toward Robin. Robin quickly turns away as they
          look at her.. When she glances back, Ki_m is walking
          towards her and Nick is bicycling away.

                         KIM
          Okay, let's go.
          The sisters start to walk across the lawn.

                         ROBIN
          Y-you 1-1-like him?

                         KIM
          Who?

                         ROBIN

                         (SMILES SHYLY)
          Y-you know.

                         KIM
          Nick? Oh, he's all right, I guess.
          They walk on in silence with Robin stealing glances at
          her big sister.

                         ROBIN

                         (FINALLY)
          Are y-y-you g-gonna m-in-marry him?

                         KIM
          Robin?
          Robin smiles and takes Kim's hand. They walk along the
          road, kicking rocks and swinging their bookbags. Sud-
          denly Kim halts.

                         KIM

                         (CONTINUING)
          Oh, damn!
          Robin looks up in surprise.

                         KIM

                         (CONTINUING)
          Debbie was gonna lend me her new
          record. Look, you go on home
          by yourself. Tell Mom I'll be
          a little late.
          Before Robin can reply, Kim is hurrying away.

                         (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED! (2)
          Robin watches her go, then moves off alone, breaking
          into a skip and playing imaginary hopscotch.
          As she turns off the main road into a side street,
          Robin passes a construction site. The empty skeleton
          of a half-finished apartment building looms up above
          the dark shade trees. Hearing VOICES, Robin stops to
          investigate.

                         ROBIN

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Alex?
          The VOICES continue. Robin moves closer, peering
          through the tall bushes surrounding the lot. She
          sees Nick playing in.the framework with three of his
          classmates. Robin recognizes JUDE CUNNINGHAM, and
          KELLY LYNCH as Kim's two best friends. The fourth
          child, WENDY RICHARDS, is a dark-haired girl, domin-
          eering and loud. As Robin watches, Wendy jumps
          up onto the floor of the building.

                         WENDY
          I want to play 'Murder.' Who's
          the killer?

                         NICK
          You, Wendy!

                         JUDE

                         (GIGGLING)
          you, Nick.

                         KELLY
          Yes, Nick!

                         WENDY

                         (LAUGHING)
          You'll never catch me. Hide your
          eyes, killer!
          As Nick turns his back, hiding his eyes against an ex-
          posed beam, the children scatter through the structure.
          Robin watches with mounting excitement as Nick finishes
          counting, and whirls around.

                         NICK
          The killer is coming for you!
          He moves into the building, chanting "Kill, kill.," in a
          low monotone. As he disappears from view, Robin cau-
          tiously edges out of the bushes and moves up to the
          building.

          NICK (O.S.
          The killer strikes!

                          (CONTINUED)

          Robin hears Jude's SQUEAL of LAUGHTER. Nick has caught
          her. Immediately Jude's VOICE TAKES UP the "kill"
          chant in unison with Nick.

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY 2

          Robin climbs up onto the floor and peers into the dark,
          gloomy structure. Suddenly, she hears a SHRIEK. Ter-
          rified, she backs against a wall. LAUGHTER FOLLOWS im-
          mediately and Robin hears Kelly's VOICE TAKING UP the
          chant. As the three "killers" move through the vast
          structure searching for Wendy, "KILL, KILT" ECHOES off
          the walls and hardwood floors.
          Robin cautiously steps out of the doorway into the im-
          mense unfinished lobby. Ominous shadows slash across
          the floor as the excited girl listens to the relentless
          CHANTING of the children.
          Robin pushes on a makeshift wooden door. It slips off
          its temporary hinges, crashing down to the floor. The
          NOISE is like a rifle shot; suddenly, there is ABSOLUTE
          SILENCE in the structure.
          Petrified, Robin crouches behind a wall, waiting. The
          CHANTING quickly RESUMES and she breathes a long sigh
          of relief.
          Robin moves through a dark corridor, hugging the walls.
          Flushed with excitement, she imagines herself a "killer"
          searching for Wendy. As she moves past an empty room,
          she hears a SOFT GIGGLE. Robin stops and listens care-
          fully. Once again she hears the GIGGLE, LOUDER this
          time, coming from nearby.
          Stepping to a doorway, she leans around the corner and
          peers inside. In the darkness she can see nothing.
          Gathering her courage, she quietly slips into the room.
          The room appears empty but a closet door is slightly
          ajar. As Robin approaches, she hears a FAINT GASP from
          behind her. Whirling around, she sees Wendy crouched
          behind a cardboard box in the corner.

                         WENDY

                         (HISSING)
          You better not tell!
          Before Robin can react, she hears a THUD from above.
          Looking up, she sees Nick's head appear through an
          opening in the ceiling. Seeing Robin, then Wendy
          standing in the corner, he howls in triumph.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Here, killers, here!
          Nick's head disappears from the opening and Robin hears
          the POUNDING of RUNNING FEET.

                         WENDY

                         (MALICIOUSLY)
          Now you've done it, you idiot!
          The CHANTING GROWS LOUDER as the "killers" rush towards
          the room. Trapped, Wendy looks frantically for an es-
          cape but finds nothing. Turning around suddenly, she
          grins at Robin, a cruel, hard expression on her face.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING; SLOWLY)
          Kill, kill, kill...
          Picking up the chant, Wendy begins to advance on Robin.
          Terrified, Robin turns and rushes out of the room,
          bowling over Nick in the doorway. Delighted that the
          game is continuing with a new victim, he follows Wendy
          in pursuit of Robin.
          Robin flees down the long, dark corridor, "KILL, KILL
          ECHOING in her wake. As she rounds a corner, Jude ap-
          pears, looming up in front of her. Robin screams and
          sprints in the opposite direction. Kelly leaps out of
          a doorway and grabs for her, but Robin, swinging out
          blindly, escapes the "killer."

          INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY 3

          Darting into the large room, Robin collapses against a
          wall, gasping for breath. As her eyes adjusts to the
          darkness, she spies a rickety ladder extending through
          a hole in the floor to the basement below. Stacked up-
          right near the opening are several sheets of window
          glass. Before Robin can make a move towards the lad-
          der, she hears a horrible SCREECH and Wendy appears in
          the doorway, a vicious look on her face.

                         WENDY
          Killers, here!
          Wendy advances. Terrified, Robin begins to back away.

                         ROBIN
          N-n-n-no!

                         CONTINUED:
          Nick, Jude and Kelly appear in the doorway, chanting
          "Kill, kill." Moving quickly, Robin grabs the ladder
          and starts down into the basement, careful not to knock
          over the sheets of glass stacked near the opening.
          Peering into the pitch-black basement, Robin hesitates.
          But as Wendy and her fellow "killers" close in on her,
          Robin continues down the ladder. Wendy rushes up and
          grabs the ladder.

                         ROBIN

                         (CONTINUING)
          P-p-please!
          Wendy grins and shakes the ladder. The chanting is
          deafening. Robin hugs the wooden slats. Wendy shakes
          even harder. Robin screams. Nick moves around Wendy
          to get a better look. He accidentally bumps the glass
          stacked next to the opening. The sudden movement is
          just enough to dislodge a razor-sharp pane of glass and
          send it hurtling down directly at Robin.
          The girl's last scream catches in her throat as the
          glass slices through her neck. She is instantly
          decapitated.
          Horrified, Wendy watches the glass and the body crash
          to the concrete basement floor. Kelly screams. Jude
          sobs loudly. Nick can only stare in shock. Finally,
          he manages to speak.

                         NICK

                         (WHISPERING HOARSELY)
          We gotta get somebody quick!
          Nick starts to go. Wendy instantly whirls, grabs his
          arm.

                         WENDY
          Are you crazy? They'll put us in
          jail!
          Confused, Nick cannot reply. The other girls grow
          silent.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING)
          If we tell anyone, they'll say
          it's our fault. Who'd believe it
          was an accident?
          Nick starts to protest.

          She looks at each of them. They are still too numb to
          respond.

          Kelly looks from Wendy to the mangled body and begins
          to whimper.

          Wendy turns to Nick. At first he appears defiant, ready
          to object, but he wilts under her withering gaze.

          With a final glance down at Robin's mutiliated body,
          Wendy quickly ushers her shocked friends out of the
          room.
          As their FOOTSTEPS ECHO away across the hardwood floor,
          there is a terrible silence. Then, starting very
          quietly, more FOOTSTEPS are HEARD, this time a single
          person approaching the ladder from above. The FOOT-
          STEPS STOP and a deep, black shadow falls across the
          ladder; HEAVY BREATHING punctuates the oppressive
          quiet, growing louder and more anguished.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STORAGE ROOM - DUSK

          We slowly TILT UP TO the tortured features of RAYMOND
          HAMMOND, Robin's father. A handsome, dark-haired man
          in his late thirties, he teaches history at George
          Winston High School.
          Wracked with grief, he stands near the opening in the
          floor and watches as two Paramedics bring up the body
          of his daughter from the dark basement.
          A young Policeman standing nearby raises the white
          sheet covering Robin's remains. Hammond steps up
          and gazes at his daughter's decapitated body. A
          look of absolute horror and revulsion freezes
          on his face; what he sees he will never forget.
          Paralyzed, Hammond barely hears the CAR PULLING UP
          in front of the construction site. He turns and
          looks out the window.

          EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DUSK 5

          A Police Officer is getting out of his car. Walking
          around to the passenger side, he opens the door
          for an attractive blonde woman in her mid-thirties.
          VIVIAN HANMOND, Robin's mother, appears pale and
          haggard as she steps out of the car. Kim and Alex
          slowly climb out of the back, With the Police Officer
          escorting her, Vivian and her children move toward
          the skeleton of a building.
          Catching sight of her husband framed in a lower window,
          Vivian suddenly breaks. away from the Police Officer and
          runs inside the building.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. STORAGE ROOM - DUSK

          Hammond moves quickly to the door, grabbing his
          hysterical wife as she bursts into the room.

                         HA:MMIOND

                         (SOBBING WILDLY)
          Where is she? Where is Robin?
          Seeing the covered figure lying on a stretcher, Vivian
          moans in anguish.
          Struggling furiously, she strains to break her hus-
          band's hold, but he is too powerful.. They are both
          in tears, shaking with grief, when Kim and Alex step
          into the doorway.

          (angrily,

                         TO VIVIAN)
          Why did you bring them here?
          Vivian collapses, burying her head in his shoulder
          and sobbing furiously, but Hammond pushes her out of
          the room.

                         (CONTINUING)
          Kim! Alex! Stay out in the
          hallway!
          Kim stumbles out into the corridor and begins to
          cry softly. Alex takes his mother's hand and tries
          comfort her.
          The Paramedics pick up the stretcher and maneuver it
          out of the room. As they pass through the doorway into
          the corridor, a corner of the sheet slips off Robin's
          corpse. Before a Paramedic can replace it, the de-
          capitated torso is briefly glimpsed by the family.
          Alex is shocked. Kim doesn't appear to realize what
          she sees. But Vivian's horror wells up in her
          throat, bursting out in a deranged scream.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Another SCREAM, as throbbing DISCO MUSIC pulsates from
          a large portable RADIO sitting on a dresser.

          SUPER: APRIL 27, 1980.
          A young woman with long, golden brown hair and a trim
          figure is slipping into a pair of tight jeans. Pull-
          ing on a halter top, she sways to the MUSIC.

          Kim! Turn that music down. You're
          driving me crazy!
          Turning around at the SOUND of her mother's VOICE, Kim
          Hammond reaches for the volume control Now eighteen,
          she is a strikingly beautiful girl with an open,
          innocent quality.

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Okay, Mom!
          Kim quickly finishes dressing, whirling around the room
          to the pounding disco rhythm. Giving her hair a few
          final strokes with a brush, she gazes at a photograph
          of a young man stuck in her mirror. On the picture
          is written: "To Kim, the best on the floor... dancing,
          that is! Love, Nick."
          Kim glances at another photograph stuck in her mirror.
          This one shows her sister, Robin, taken a few days be-
          fore the accident. Her sadness passes as quickly as it
          came. Gathering her textbooks, she switches OFF the
          RADIO and exits.

          8 INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Raymond and Vivian Hammond are just finishing break-
          fast. The years have favored him; except for a touch
          of gray around the temples and a few extra pounds, he
          looks much the same way as we remember him. Vivian,
          however, wears the strain of the past seven years
          in her gaunt, drawn features and high-strung manner.
          Thumbing through his morning newspaper, Hammond steals
          quick glances at his wife. She does not look up at
          him, but stares at the table, toying with her spoon.

          I'll tell you, Vi, I'm thinking
          of starting up an armed robbery
          course at the high school..
          I've got a feeling it'd be
          popular...
          He smiles at his joke, looks at her. She doesn't seem
          to have heard him.

          hurries after his wife. Going out through the swinging
          door, he bumps into a young man just entering.

          shakes his head, then begins to rummage through the
          Pantry, pulling out a Hostess viTikie. ?lopping
          down at the table, he flips open his electronics book
          and begins to read. Munching on his Twinkie, he

          9 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Hammond and Vivian are standing by the fireplace. His
          hand is on her shoulder. She faces the mantel, her
          back to him. On the mantel is a small shrine to the
          memory oftheir dead daughter; a framed photograph,
          fresh roses, two candles and a lock of her hair in a
          glass case.

                         HAMMOND
          Trust me.
          Vivian does not move. Finally, after a long pause,
          she turns toward her husband. Her eyes filled with
          tears, she nods.

          10 INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY 10

          Hammond is driving. Vivian stares blankly out the win-
          dow at the grimy city streets. Sitting in the back,
          Kim and Alex exchange uncertain glances. A tense si-
          lence pervades.

          The Hammonds' car pulls up in front of a towering

          Vivian is already reaching for the door handle,

          Alex jumps out of the car and opens the door for his
          mother. Taking her arm, he helps her out. Kim leans
          over in the back seat.

                         KIM
          See you later,'Mom.
          Vivian gives her a thin smile. Hammond takes her arm
          and leads her into the imposing building.

          Hammond and Vivian cross the room. Though she offers
          no resistance, it appears he is pulling her along.
          They hurry into an elevator after an elderly CLEANING
          WOMAN carrying a mop and a bucket.

          15 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 15

          They stand in silence. The Cleaning Woman puffs on a
          cigarette, blithely ignoring the NO SMOKING sign posted
          on the wall. Vivian nervously reaches into her purse
          and removes a bottle of Valium. Quickly popping two
          pills into her mouth, she swallows with difficulty and
          snaps her purse shut. Hammond says nothing.
          Just as the elevator doors slide open, the Cleaning Wo-
          man touches Vivian on the shoulder, causing her to jump
          in fright.

                         CLEANING WOMAN
          Could I have one of those? My
          nerves are shot this morning.
          With a terrified glance back at the woman, Vivian
          rushes out of the elevator. Hammond follows.

          16 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 16

          Hammond and Vivian move down the long, empty hallway.
          As they round a corner, a figure is visible unlocking
          a door.

                         HAI` IOND

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Dr. Fairchild!
          DR. RUPERT FAIRCHILD straightens up and turns around.
          He's a. portly man in his fifties, trying to disguise
          his girth with careful tailoring.

          17 INT. OFFICE - DAY 17

          Fairchild bustles about the reception area, turning on
          lights, checking his messages and appointment calendar.
          Fairchild is obsessively neat, the office reflects him.

                         HAIIOND
          We appreciate your seeing... us.
          I know how busy you must be.
          Vivian is staring at a painting of a young girl playing
          with a kitten. Catching Fairchild's eye, Hammond nods
          toward the outer door. Vivian does not notice the
          gesture.

                         17 CONTINUED: 17
          Fairchild nods in return. Stepping over to his inner
          office, he opens the door.

                         FAIRCHILD
          Have a seat, Vivian. I'll be
          right in.
          She slowly crosses the room, turning suddenly in the
          doorway.

                         VIVIAN

                         (TO HAMMOND)
          Don't forget we're going to the
          cemetery this afternoon. I want
          Robin to have her flowers.
          Hammond moves over to his wife. Taking her by the
          shoulders, he kisses her lightly on the forehead.

                         HAMMOND
          I won't forget.
          Vivian looks from Hammond to Fairchild, who smiles.
          She enters the office, leaving the door open. Hammond
          shakes hands with Fairchild, and for Vivian's benefit
          adds...
          HAï¿½I`i IOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          Thank you, Doctor.
          Hammond exits.

          18 , INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 18

          Hammond leans against the wall outside Fairchild's of-
          fice. He glances at his watch. The door opens and
          Fairchild steps out, holding a container. Hammond
          walks with him down the corridor towards the water
          fountain.

          H.ANMOND
          She's at it again.

                         FAIRCHILD

                         (NODS)
          Today's the date?

                         HAIM BOND
          Seven years ago today Robin was
          killed.
          Fairchild looks up from filling his container with
          water.

          This would have been her first prom.

                         FAIRCHILD
          Pardon?

                         HAKMOND
          Tonight's the Junior-Senior Prom
          at our high school. Robin would
          have been sixteen, She and Alex.

                         FAIRCHILD
          The twins... How is Alex?

                         HAIIOND
          Fine. I just thank God he was too
          young to really understand what
          happened to his sister.

                         FAIRCHILD
          And your older daughter?

                         HANMOND

                         (SMILES)
          Kimmy's my princess. Sometimes she'll
          get depressed for a while... but it
          never lasts long. Young people seem
          so much more... resilient.
          They walk back to the office.

                         FAIRCHILD
          (looking up at Hammond)
          And yourself? No scars?

                         HATIOND
          (after a pause)
          I've learned to live them..
          Vivian seems worse this time.

                         FAIRCHILD

                         (NODS)
          The persistence of Vivian's trauma.
          I wonder if there isn't something
          more serious at work here?

                         HAMOND
          Something more serious than her
          daughter's death?

          19 INT. OFFICE - DAY 19

          Vivian fidgets in her chair. She seems very small and
          vulnerable in the large, somber office.

          20 INT. CAR (MOVING) DAY 20

          Alex is seated opposite his father in the front seat.
          Kim is in back. Easy listening MUSIC PLAYS softly on
          the car RADIO. Alex fiddles with the tuning dial,
          searching for music more to his tastes. Lost in
          thought, Hammond does not see the young girl skipping
          through the pedestrian crossing.

                         KIM

                         (SCREAMS)
          Daddy!
          Hammond slams on the brakes, throwing Alex against
          the dashboard.

          21 EXT. STREET - DAY 21

          The CAR SCREECHES to a halt inches away from the terri-
          fied child who stands frozen in the middle of the
          crossing. After a moment, realizing she is safe, the
          girl giggles nervously and skips away.

          22 INT. CAR - DAY 22

          Hammond lets out a sigh and turns to his children.

                         HAMMOND
          You all right?
          They both nod. Alex massages his wrist. Hammond
          slips the car into gear and cautiously continues
          driving.

                         KIM
          You're worried about Mom?

                         HALMOND
          I was...
          He is interrupted by DISCO MUSIC ON the RADIO. Play-
          ing with the tuning dial, Alex quickly tries to pass
          over the music.

                         KIM
          Hey, keep that!
          Alex groans but does as she asks.

                         ALEX
          Disco sucks!

                         (DRYLY)
          That's much better.
          The car pulls into the Winston High School parking lot.
          They pile out.

          23 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 23

           Hammond, Kim and Alex walk through the empty lot
           towards the school. Suddenly, we HEAR a loud GRATING
          SOUND coming from nearby. The sudden noise startles
          Kim and she huddles against her father.
          A seedy little middle-aged man with a stubble of gray
          beard appears from behind a row of bushes, brandishing
          a pair of electric hedge clippers.

                         HANMMMOND
          Good morning, Mr. Sykes.
          SANFORD SYKES, the newly-hired custodian, bares his
          yellow teeth in a crooked grin and waves the whirring
          blades in salute. Kim shudders and stays close to
          her father as they walk on.

                         KIM
          He's creepy.

                         ALEX
          I heard he's wacko.

                         HAIIOND
          The man is not... wacko.

          Kelly says he's a pervert, spying
          on the girls undressing in the
          locker room.

                         HAIIOND
          Sykes may have some problems, but
          he's no Peeping Tom. He's been
          thoroughly checked out.

          You're early today. Plenty of
          time to study with no one to
          bother you.
          Kim reaches up.and kisses her father on the cheek.
          Pulling out a fashion magazine, she rushes off, call-
          ing back over her shoulder.

                         KIM
          I'.ve got to decide on my hair

          I'm building an atomic bomb in
          shop.
          Smiling, he moves inside. Hammond shakes his head
          and hurries off.

          24 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 24

          Hammond moves through the empty hallway, stopping at
          a door which reads: PRINCIPAL: RAYMOND HAMMOND. He
          is fumbling for his key when he sees through the
          frosted glass a figure moving around in his office.
          Reaching for the doorknob, he very quietly opens the
          door.

          25 INT. OFFICE DAY 25

          As the door slowly swings open, Hammond sees the outer
          office covered with pieces of paper; sheets are
          scattered across desks and chairs and over most of
          the floor. Stepping inside, Hammond spies a WOMAN
          bending over, frantically picking up paper from the
          floor.
          He slams the door. At the sudden SOUND, the startled
          Woman whirls around, still squatting, and falls on her
          rear.

                         HAMMIOND
          Who are you?

          Hammond tosses his briefcase onto the desk and drops
          into his chair. He stares at the telephone for a long
          moment, drumming his finger on the desk.

          27 INT. BEDROOM - DAY 27

          A pink TELEPHONE RINGS. The plush bedroom is empty;
          suddenly Wendy Richards rushes in. Now eighteen, Wendy
          is a raven-haired beauty with a full figure, accentua-
          ted by a low-cut black blouse and tight designer jeans.
          Tossing her books onto the bed, she eagerly grabs the
          receiver.

          Nick?
          A long pause, followed by HEAVY BREATHING. Wendy is
          about to respond when the inhuman VOICE speaks in an
          eerie, androgynous stutter.

                         TELEPHONE VOICE
          W-Wendy? T-t-tonight it's m-m-my
          t-turn!
          Wendy's shock quickly turns to anger.

                         WENDY
          Screw you, Lou!
          Wendy slams the receiver into its cradle. Grabbing her
          books, she storms out of her bedroom.

          28 INT. FRONT HALL - DAY 28

          Wendy hurries do-in the ornate staircase.
          Waiting at the bottom holding the girl's sweater is
          MAUDE, the Richards' elderly housekeeper.

                         MAUDE
          You be home for dinner, Wendy?
          Wendy angrily grabs her sweater from the woman.

          The expansive residence sits back off the road in this
          upper-middle-class suburb. Wendy climbs into her
          white Mustang and starts the engine. TIRES SQUEALING,
          she ROARS out of the driveway with the RADIO BLASTING.

          30 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 30

          Kelly Lynch is just finishing breakfast when the
          TELEPHONE RINGS. The petite blonde eighteen-year-old

          K-K-Kelly? T-tonight it's m-m-ï¿½IZ
          Horrified, Kelly drops the phone. The DOORBELL RINGS.
          Frightened, she gasps, hugging the wall. The DOORBELL
          RINGS again. Very slowly she moves out of the kitchen.

          31 INT. HALL - DAY 31

          Kelly cautiously approaches the front door. Peering
          through a crack in the drapes, she sees a dark figure
          huddled near the door. With the latch secured, she
          takes a deep breath and opens the door.

                         KELLY
          Yes?

          DREW (O.S.)
          Christ, Kelly, c'mon! We're late!
          Relief floods across her face. Kelly quickly unfastens
          the latch.

                         KELLY
          Oh, Drew, thank God!
          She throws herself into the arms of the pleasantly sur-
          prised DREW SHINNICK, a muscular blond athlete.

                         DREW
          (holding her tightly)
          I'm glad to see you, too.

          She looks up at him.

                         KELLY
          Drew, this horrible -voice...

                         DREW
          Nightmare?

                         KELLY
          On the telephone. It sounded so
          evil!

                         DREW

                         (LAUGHING)
          What'd you get, a heavy breather?

                         KELLY
          Worse than that...

                         DREW

                         (INTERRUPTS)
          Turned you on did he? Maybe I
          should try that!
          She breaks from his grasp.

                         KELLY
          'm serious!
          Drew makes a grab for her but she avoids him, hurries
          inside. He sighs and leans against the doorjamb to
          wait.

                         DREW
          So am I.,.

          32 INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY 32

          Drew is driving, his-arm around Kelly. She still
          appears shaken by the telephone call. The RADIO is ON.
          His right hand slowly descends towards her breast.
          She swats it away. The hand moves to her back, slid-
          ing down. She leans back, pinning his arm against the
          seat.
          The car stops at a light and Drew is instantly on Kelly,
          biting her neck and kissing her hard on the mouth. She
          pushes him back.

                         KELLY

                         (ANGRY)
          I thought we were late.

                         KELLY
          Really?
          Drew HONKS the HORN at another driver.

                         DREW
          Hell, you should be glad. A lot
          of girls would love to have
          someone steady like me.
          His irrepressible right hand starts up her leg.

                         KELLY

                         (MOCK-SWEETLY)
          Steady? You mean persistent,
          don't you, darling?
          Grabbing his hand, she holds it firmly in her lap,
          which doesn't bother Drew at all.

          33 INT. HALL - DAY

          Jude Cunningham is leaving her house when the TELE-
          PHONE RINGS. The chubby, brown-haired girl rushes
          back into the hallway.
          A plump, middle-aged woman hurries out of the kitchen,
          wiping her hands on an apron. MRS. CUNNINGHAM
          eagerly watches her daughter snap up the receiver.
          The pause, the HEAVY BREATHING and the strange,
          terrifying voice.

                         TELEPHONE VOICE
          J-Jude? T-t-tonight it's my-my
          t-t-turn!
          A disappointed Jude slowly replaces the receiver. Mrs.
          Cunningham looks on sympathetically.
          Still no date?

                         JUDE
          (shakes her head)
          Getting closer, though.

                         (SMILES)
          An obscene call... and not very
          obscene at that!
          Mrs. Cunningham starts to say something.

                         JUDE

                         (CONTINUING)
          Sorry, Mom, gotta run.
          Giving her mother a quick peck on the cheek, Jude
          exits.

          34 EXT. CUNNINGHAM'S HOUSE - DAY

          The small house appears almost identical to the other
          dwellings in this lower-middle-class neighborhood. Jude
          pulls an apple from her large purse, munching while
          she walks to the bus stop.
          A gaudily-painted van pulls up alongside her. The win-
          dow slowly rolls down and a young curly-haired GUY
          wearing glasses sticks out his head.

                         GUY
          Hey, beautiful, need a lift?
          Jude continues walking, the van moving slowly alongside
          her.

                         JUDE
          No thanks.

                         GUY
          C'mon, I won't bite.
          Jude chomps down hard on her apple.

                         JUDE
          So who are you?
          TheGuy leans further out the window.

                         GUY
          Seymour Stone but..
          He's cut short as the van bounces up onto the sidewalk.
          Jude shrieks. The flustered boy steers the van quickly
          back onto the road.

          Jude laughs, almost choking on her apple.

                         JUDE
          I can see why... How old are you,
          Slick?

                         GUY (SLICK)
          Old enough...

                         JUDE
          I've heard about guys like you...
          running over girls on the sidewalk...

                         SLICK
          Just some girls... If they're good
          lookin' I give 'em a ride.

                         (SMILING)
          Can you stop that thing?
          Slick jams on the brakes. The van jerks to a halt.
          He opens the passenger door.

                         JUDE

                         (CONTINUING)

          She climbs inside.

          35 INT. VAN (MOVING- DAY 35

          The interior is decked out in plush red carpet with a
          bed in back, a stereo cassette deck, and a small fridge.
          MUSIC is PLAYING. Jude looks around.

                         JUDE
          Looks like a cheap motel.

                         SLICK
          Cheap?... that's a two hundred
          dollar waterbed there...
          Jude turns around for a look.

          You think this is the time to study?
          She grabs the book, gives it to him. He places it on
          the fold-down table between them, flips it open. The
          inside is hollowed out into a container. It contains
          nearly a hundred neatly rolled joints.

                         SLICK
          Straight to Winston High?

          36 EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT DAY

          The van weaves through the parked cars, passing up
          several vacant spots. It finally SCREECHES to a halt
          at the far end of the lot near some high bluffs over-
          looking a lake.

          37 INT. VAN

          The air is thick with smoke.

          back room. He's Nick McBride. His father pulls open
          the front door.

          McBride steps out into the hallway. Nick grabs his
          books and follows. The TELEPHONE RINGS. Nick hesi-

          40 INT. SCHOOL SHOP - DAY 40

          Alex is alone in the large room. ROCK MUSIC BOOMS out
          of two huge SPEAKERS suspended from the ceiling. Alex
          sits behind a console, flipping switches and turning
          dials, electronically distorting the music.
          A wall TELEPHONE RINGS.. Caught up in his own manufac-
          tured sounds, Alex ignores it. After several more
          RINGS, he reluctantly leaves the console and answers
          the phone.

                         ALEX
          Hello... what?...
          He listens, expressionless, then hangs up. He flips
          a switch on the console and the MUSIC STOPS. He sits
          there a moment, thinking. Then he turns out the lights
          and exits.

          Kim walks down the long deserted corridor. She hears
          FOOTSTEPS. She turns. No one. Shaking her head, she
          continues walking.
          The FOOTSTEPS return, louder. Kim begins to hurry.
          She rounds a corner and slips against the wall, waiting.
          Silence. With a deep breath, she moves on to her
          locker.
          Kim quickly twists the dial on the combination lock and
          yanks open the door. Grabbing several books she slams
          the door shut.
          A mop HANDLE CRASHES into the locker, missing her head
          by inches. The SHARP REPORT echoes down the corridor.
          Terrified, Kim jumps back, spins around. Sykes is
          standing there.

                         SYKES
          S-s-sorry, Missy. You hurt?
          Her heart pounding wildly, Kim rushes into the gym.
          Sykes picks up his mop.

          42, INT. DAY 42

          Kim runs into the huge deserted gym, glancing frantical-
          ly over her shoulder. Her FOOTSTEPS CLATTER across the
          hardwood floor. She stops, waits to recover her breath.
          The room glows tgith a crystalline light sparkling off
          the silver decorations put up for the Prom. Stretched
          across the bleachers is a banner reading: "DISCO

          MADNESS."
          Gazing around, Kim feels the excitement of anticipation.
          Imagining herself in Nick's arms, she begins to dance,
          whirling through the gym to the music in her head.
          Suddenly, someone is clapping, slowly.

          WENDY (O.S.)
          Bravo...
          Kim stops abruptly. Standing onstage, watching her, is
          Wendy.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING)
          Practicing for tonight?

                         KIM
          Yes, as a matter of fact... I was
          just...

                         WENDY
          Thinking about Nick, maybe?

                         KIM
          That's my business.

                         WENDY
          You wish! Nick is King of the
          Prom, you happen to be Queen of
          the Prom... that's all there is to
          it, Hammond... As far as anything
          else... Nick is mine...

                         KIM
          You really ought to tell him that.

                         WENDY
          I'm telling you, okay? Stay away
          from Nick!

                         KIM
          You and Nick haven't been together
          in ages.

                         WENDY

                         WENDY
          It's not who you go with, honey...
          it's who takes you home.

                         KIM
          I'll try and remember that.

          43 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 43

          The corridor is packed with students -- flirting,
          gossiping, fighting, a few even studying. We PICK UP
          Kim and VICKI CANTRELL, eighteen, moving down the crowd-
          ed hallway through the various conversations.

                         KIM

          Kim. and Vicki excitedly hug Jude. A big, bushy-haired
          youth with a stubble of beard strolls by, smirking when
          he sees the girls embracing. LOU PERANO, a twenty-year-
          old high school junior, stops and stares.

                         LOU
          I knew there was some reason Kim
          wouldn't go out with me. She likes

          Let's go.
          They head down the hallway to their lockers. Lou tags
          along.

                         LOU
          You girls get bored with each
          other, I'm always around, you know?
          They pass Kelly and Drew huddled at her locker. His
          hands rest on her shoulders. They are talking intently.

                         VICKI
          Poor girl must be exhausted. Look
          how he has to hold her up...

                         WITH WENDY)
          Uh oh.
          Kim stops suddenly and turns to look. Lou bumps into
          her, his hand purposely grazing her rear.

                         KIM
          Go play with yourself, Lou.

                         LOU
          I'm saving it for you.
          Kim sighs with disgust and turns around as Nick walks
          up talking to Wendy.

          We'll talk about it later, lover.

          Kim does not turn back. Walking next to her, Vicki
          watches her friend curiously. Kim giggles. A sneaky
          smile creeps across her face.

          quick smile and disappears around a corner to the hoots
          of Vicki and Jude.

          44 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 44

          A tall dark figure walks quickly down a concrete cor-

          The door edges open. Raymond Hammond appears. Prop-
          ping the door open with his shoulder, he starts down
          across the narrow gallery to the pool below.

          46 INT. POOL 46

          A class of senior male students occupies the water,
          among them Nick McBride and Drew Shinnick. With no
          Phys. Ed. instructor in sight, it's a general goof-off
          period.
          Nick walks out onto the diving board. Drew is treading
          water below him.

          47 ANGLE ON HAMMOND 47

          48 INT. POOL 48

          Nick launches himself out over Drew in an apparent
          belly-flop. At the last moment, he tucks in and hits
          the water in a flipped over cannonball. He surfaces to
          a chorus of whistles and cheers. It was a close shave.

                         DREW
          You wanta take care of yourself,

          The door is easing shut. Hammond is nowhere to be seen.

          50 INT. GYM - DAY 50

          A side door opens. Hammond steps in, gazes around.
          The gym is empty, silent. He walks to the stage steps,
          climbs up, pushes through the thick curtain.

          51 INT. GYM - BACKSTAGE 51

          It's a dark cluttered area broken up by tall partitions,
          discarded flats from old student productions, banks of
          lights.
          Hammond crosses to a rear door, tries it. It's locked.
          He turns back. As he does so there's a sudden WHIRRING
          SOUND. A row of spotlights flashes on right in front
          of him, almost blinding him. He tries to shield his
          eyes.

          He spins around. Another bank of lights flares at
          him. He staggers downstage. The curtains begin to
          swing open. Startled, he jumps away from them. His
          foot lands on a package of photo-flood bulbs.. There's
          a LOUD POP. Then a VOICE.

          ALEX (O.S.)
          Who's there?
          Hammond, shaken, looks across to the far wing. There's
          an elevated platform where the electronic control panel
          is located. Alex peers down.

                         HAMMOND
          Alex?... What the hell're you
          doing?

                         ALEX

          together.

          He turns, climbs down the stage steps and starts back
          across the gym. At the other end of the floor a door
          opens, Sykes looks in. Hammond sees him.

          HA, MOND

          52 INT. CLASSROOM (LAB) - DAY 52

          First period biology class features MONTY WELLER, a
          tall, thin Englishman in his late thirties. This stuf-
          fy, dour science teacher drones on about the joys of ex-
          ploring frog vertebrae while most of his class naps,
          daydreams or passes notes.
          Seated in the back near the door, Jude is furtively
          opening a handwritten note. She quickly reads it.
          Stifling a giggle, she looks up to see Kim and Vicki
          across the aisle, eagerly awaiting her reply. Jude
          tears out part of a page from her biology book and
          scrawls her answer. Folding the note, she taps the boy
          next to her and motions for him to pass it on.
          Vicki grabs the note from the boy. Quickly scanning
          it, she nods, impressed. Kim reads it and mouths the
          word "Wow" to Jude who blushes happily.
          Glancing out into the hallway, Jude notices Slick walk-
          ing past. Seeing her in class, he stops and waves.
          Jude frantically tries to motion him away. Their backs
          to the door, Kim and Vicki watch with curiosity as Jude
          gestures in their direction. Seeing her friends
          watching her, Jude smiles and tries to ignore Slick.
          Not to be denied, he exaggeratedly mimes Weller, nose
          to his textbook, lecturing on, oblivious to his class.
          Jude laughs in spite of herself. Kim and Vicki turn
          around.
          Glancing out the door, the two girls stare in disbelief
          at the small weird curly-haired boy doing a perfect im-
          itation of the eminently boring Weller. Their surprise
          turns to hilarity as they realize this boy must be
          Jude's prom date. Kim holds up the note, raising her

          and Vicki can barely contain their laughter. They do
          not notice Mr. Weller eyeing them suspiciously as he
          rattles on about frog intestines. Slick mouths the
          words, "See you at lunch.., in the van." Jude nods and
          smiles.
          With a final bow and a wave, he exits.
          Kim suddenly looks up to find a red-faced Mr. Weller
          looming above her.

                         WELLER
          Miss Hammond!
          Wide-eyed, Kim desperately tries to crush the note in
          her hand.

          Kim swallows and steals a quick glance at her friends.
          Vicki winces. Jude tries to disappear beneath her, seat.

          The classroom erupts into laughter as the BELL RINGS,
          signaling the end of the class. Still laughing, stu-
          dents gather their books and shuffle out, several giv-

          He spins on his heel and marches back to his desk. The
          three girls hurriedly exit.

          53 INT. ROOM (SCHOOL) - DAY 53

          A hand is flipping through the pages of the Winston
          High yearbook, the back pages where the individual
          photographs of graduating students are placed. The
          hand stops, moves across an open page to a smiling head
          shot of Nick McBride.
          The hand rips the picture from the page, sets it down
          on a plain wooden desk alongside three other pictures
          -with similar torn edges. The other pictures are of
          Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch, and Wendy Richards.
          The yearbook is slammed shut.

          54 INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 54

          Kim, Jude and Vicki enter the crowded room. MUSIC from
          several portable RADIOS can be HEARD above the clamor
          as the girls move into the long lunch line. Kim spots
          Alex seated nearby and waves to him.

          Here comes the incredible hunk
          himself.
          Jude looks up to see Slick slowly making his way down
          the line towards them. He is carrying a tray piled
          high with snack food: potato chips, cookies, candy.
          Jude smiles as he passes her, grinning.

                         KIM
          Looks like a party.

                         JUDE
          Yeah -- I don't think he's gonna
          be too good for my diet...
          Slick moves down the lunch line. Suddenly he is bumped
          from behind, sending the tray and the snacks flying
          across the room. Looking around, Slick jumps back,
          startled by a tall figure wearing a dark ski mask.

          Lou and his friends shove ahead in the line until he is
          standing behind Kim. Lou nuzzles Kim's neck.

          Startled, Kim spins around. Her fear quickly becomes
          anger.

                         KIM
          It's an improvement!
          She turns her back to him.

                         FACE HIM)
          Have a taste.
          He kisses her hard on the mouth. Swinging at him, Kim
          breaks away. Laughing, Lou grabs her wrists and rough-
          ly pulls her to him. Alex instantly jumps to his feet.

                         LOU

                         (CONTINUING;
          holding Kim close)
          Be nice...
          Alex leaps over the metal railing separating the line
          from the tables. Crashing into Lou, he drives the
          larger boy back into the salad counter, sending food
          and utensils flying. As they tumble off the counter
          onto the floor, Alex gets in several furious punches
          before Lou's gang can pry him loose.
          Two of the gang pin Alex against the counter. Wiping
          blood from his mouth, Lou grins maliciously and slugs
          Alex in the stomach. The boy groans and doubles over.
          Lou grabs Alex's hair and slams his head back against
          the glass shield of the counter.
          As Lou rears back to throw another punch, his two
          friends suddenly release Alex and scatter. The boy
          crumples to the floor. Lou turns around to see two
          MALE TEACHERS rapidly approaching. The larger teacher
          grabs Lou.

                         TEACHER
          This time you're out, Perano.
          Lou points to Alex who is being helped up from the
          floor.

          Alex nods, leaning on the other teacher for support.

          That's not true! Alex was trying
          to help me.
          The teacher looks from Kim to Lou to Alex.

          You'd better come along to your
          father's office.

          a warning?
          Several students laugh. The two Teachers march Lou and
          Alex through the silent cafeteria. Lou swaggers bask-
          ing in the attention. Alex walks with his head bowed.
          They exit.

          Lou and Alex accompany the teachers down the corridor
          toward the principal's office. Nick and Wendy approach
          from the opposite direction, talking heatedly.

          Hammond is talking on the telephone. He appears agi-
          tated, running his fingers through his hair and tugging
          at the knot in his loosened tie.

          The door opens and Adele Cooper's head peers around the
          corner. Seeing Hammond talking on the phone, she nods
          toward the outer office. Hammond gestures for her to
          wait. She persists until he angrily takes the receiver
          from his ear and covers the mouthpiece.

          That I'll play favorites? That
          I'll go easy on Alex because he's
          my son?
          (pauses, waiting for
          Lou to back down and

                         LOOK AWAY)
          Damn right I will! You're a
          disgrace to this school and this
          community...

                         (RECOVERS SOMEWHAT)
          You're suspended --
          indefinitely! Now get out!

                         LOU

                         (SNEERS)
          What about your son?

                         HAMMOND

                         (ICILY)
          If you're not off school grounds
          in five minutes, I'll have you
          arrested for trespassing.
          Lou stalks to the door. Opening it, he turns to Alex.

                         LOU
          See you around.
          He exits, slamming the door.

                         HAMMOND

                         (WITHOUT LOOKING

                         AT ALEX)
          Have the nurse take a look at you,
          then get back here.
          Alex exits. Hammond angrily grabs Lou's ski mask and
          hurls it at the trash can_

          57 EXT. FRONT LAWN - DAY 57

          Kim and Vicki are sprawled on the grass eating lunch.
          Lou storms down the front steps. Pausing at the bottom,
          he turns, strolls over to Kim.

                         LOU
          Watch for me, little girl. You
          know I'm just a kiss away.
          Lou laughs and walks off toward the parking lot. Kim
          shudders.
          Wendy's white Mustang slides up to the curb. The pass-
          enger window rolls down and Lou leans over to look in-
          side. After a moment he climbs in and the MUSTANG
          PEELS out of the lot, leaving twin black tread marks in
          its wake.

                         KIM
          What a pair!

                         VICKI
          Made for each other!
          Kim opens a carton of yogurt.

                         KIM
          You wearing that green gown tonight?

                         VICKI
          You kidding? That was last year.
          This year... red silk!
          (smiles and runs her
          hand from her neck
          to her waist)
          Cut to here! ...

          NICK (O.S.)
          Cut to where?
          Kim and Vicki turn to see Nick ambling across the lawn
          toward them.

                         VICKI

                         (MOCK-SEDUCTIVELY)

          On the prowl!

          58 EXT. STREET - DAY

          Wendy's white Mustang streaks through traffic, dodging
          in and out of lanes, running yellows, burning around
          corners.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59 INT. MUSTANG 59

          Lou sits pinned to the passenger seat, eyes wide,
          staring straight ahead as if he can't quite believe
          this trip. His bravado seems to have left him. He
          glances over at Wendy in the driver's seat. She's
          puffing on a cigarette, handling the wheel almost
          casually. She's in control,

          60 EXT. DRIVE-IN 60

          The Mustang suddenly slows down and makes a hard left
          turn, narrowly beating a horn-honking oncoming van.
          The big white car bounces up over the curb and sweeps
          into the end slot at a sprawling fast-food drive-in.

          61 INT. MUSTANG 61

          Lou's still pinned to his seat. Wendy shuts off the
          engine, looks at him. He looks at her, lets out a
          long deep breath.
          A cute little CAR-HOP in a cut-off costume and roller
          skates glides over. She leans into Wendy's window,
          talks through a wad of gum.

                         CAR-HOP
          Ready to order?

                         WENDY

                         (TO LOU)
          What do you want?
          Lou's shifting around in his seat, pulling himself
          together.

                         LOU
          I'm uh... a little short on cash..

                         WENDY
          You can owe me.

                         LOU
          Yeah? Okay then, a couple of
          burgers, a large fries... what
          kind of beer you got?

                         CAR- HOP
          C'mon man, this is a drive-in not
          a bar.

                         LOU
          All right, all right... don't get
          nervous... Gimme a coke...

          She'll have the same.

                         WENDY
          A small diet cola.

                         WENDY
          That ' sit.
          The Car-hop shrugs, wheels away. Wendy turns to Lou.

                         WENDY
          I'll buy you one for Christmas,
          all right? Now, how do I know
          you're serious?

                         LOU
          Whatta you mean, serious? I hate
          that school, Hammond and his
          asshole family...

                         WENDY
          I don't want anyone hurt... not
          badly.

                         LOU
          You got it... anything your little
          heart desires...

                         WENDY
          Lou, shouldn't we go over this.
          Lou puts his finger to her mouth, silencing her.

                         LOU
          I'll take care of it, Scout's
          honor... Don't worry about it...

                         (CONTINUED)

          He caresses her cheek and lips, then kisses her. At
          first reluctant, Wendy quickly takes over. When they
          finally break from their passionate clinch, he is
          gasping.

                         LOU

                         (CONTINUING)
          Jesus Christ!

                         WENDY
          Don't worry about it..
          She unbuttons his shirt and begins to kiss and lick his
          chest. Slowly she works her way down. Lou begins to
          writhe. Wendy's head disappears from VIEW. Lou's eyes
          snap open in surprise.
          Wendy groans.

                         WEND Y
          Damn stick shift!
          Lou starts to protest, then dissolves.

          62,. INT. MUSTANG - DAY 62

          The Car-hop wheels up to the Mustang carrying a tray
          loaded with food. She leans over and peers inside.
          Wendy is behind the wheel, perfectly composed. A mind-
          blown Lou is hurriedly doing up his belt, tucking in
          his shirt. He glances at the Car-hop then turns away
          to finish the job.

                         CAR-HOP
          Enjoy your meal.

          63 EXT. LAKE-SIDE BLUFFS - DAY 63

          A WIDE VIEW; high weather-worn bluffs tumbling down to
          a strip of beach and the calm blue waters of the lake.
          Above the bluffs there's a narrow shaded park and then
          the buildings and parking lots of Winston High.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         63 CONTINUED:
          Nick and Kim walk slowly along the rim of the bluffs.
          Nick has his arm around her. She leans into him.

                         KIM
          I am excited, it's just... in some
          ways it's such an awful day... It's
          Robin's day...

          64 EXT. BLUFFS CLOSER ANGLE 64


                         KIM
          My mother's all upset, as usual.
          My father too... he doesn't show
          it so much... It's hard to get
          over something like that. Robin
          would have been a junior, like
          Alex. This would've been her first
          prom... I guess that's'why it seems
          so much worse this year...
          She stops, turns and faces Nick. It's hard for him to
          meet her gaze.

                         KIM

                         (CONTINUING)
          The Queen of the Prom is determined
          not to let it get to her... She
          must maintain her... whatever, at all
          costs..
          She tries a weak smile. Nick stares at her, then sud-
          denly takes her, pulls her to him, embraces her. She's
          caught by surprise, but she responds.
          She smiles.

                         KIN
          I love you too.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Di.

                         NICK
          I'm... I want you to know that...
          Robin's death... I remember it and
          I've always been... so sorry
          about it...
          Kim looks puzzled.

                         NICK

                         (CONTINUING)
          I mean... I know what you're
          feeling... I've...
          (looks at her)
          :Listen I...
          Across the school parking lot a CAR HORN BLARES, inter-
          rupts Nick. Kim reacts.

                         KIM
          That's my father... I've got to go,
          Okay?

                         NICK
          Yeah... I'll see you later.
          She hesitates a moment, then kisses him quickly, turns
          and goes. Nick looks shaken up. He stares after her
          as she hurries away.
          Behind Nick, in the other corner of the parking lot, a
          metal door slides open, loud RAUNCHY ROCK and ROLL sud-
          denly infests the air. Nick turns, sees Jude climbing
          out of Slick's van. Jude looks about as stoned as she
          can get. She spots Nick, waves.

                         JUDE
          Hey, Nick!
          Nick turns and heads the other way.

          65 EXT. CEMETERY - HAMMOND PLOT - DAY 65

          There's a small marble headstone inset with the carved
          face of an angel and the inscription "Robin Anne Hammond
          1964 - 1973 Too Soon Taken From Us."
          Kneeling beside the grave is Vivian Hammond. She's ar-
          ranging a large bouquet of mixed flowers, fussing with
          them, trying for some kind of impossible perfection.

          HP`ï¿½MOND (0. S.

          She doesn't react, she keeps playing with the flowers.
          Hammond moves in behind her, puts his hands on her
          shoulders. She looks at him.

                         HAMMOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          We have to get back.
          She stands, with her husband's support. Kim and Alex
          are standing quietly at the foot of the grave. Vivian
          looks at them both. Her eyes hold a terrible rage, a
          terrible sadness. Hammond carefully guides her away.
          Kim has a flower of her own, a white rose, which she
          drops on her sister's grave. She turns, meets Alex's
          stare, moves off after her parents. Alex remains a mo-
          ment longer, then. he, too, goes.

          66 EXT. TENNIS COURTS DAY

          During the afternoon phys. ed. class, the girls play
          tennis: Kim with Kelly and Vicki with Jude. Sykes
          lingers nearby, watching the girls. Their instructor
          is Miss HENRI-ANNE BENTON, a stocky woman in her late
          thirties with teased, lacquered hair. A product of
          genteel Southern womanhood, Henri-Anne stalks the
          courts in her baggy Bermuda shorts, constantly blowing
          a silver whistle hanging from her neck.
          A very stoned, giggling Jude runs Vicki ragged, hitting
          balls over the fence, straight up in the air and occa-
          sionally even back over her head. Each time a ball
          flies over the fence, Vicki runs to retrieve it to the
          delight of Sykes.
          At one point, Vicki bends over to pick up a ball under
          Sykes' appreciative gaze. The shrill WHISTLE inter-
          rupts her as Henri-Anne rushes over.

                         HENRI-ANNE

                         (SOUTHERN ACCENT)
          No, no, Miss Cantrell! Never bend
          from the waist... Squat!

                         (DEMONSTRATES)
          Always squat to retrieve.
          Otherwise, you look like the broad
          side of a barn!
          (glares at Sykes)
          Isn't that so, Mr. Sykes?
          Embarrassed, the custodian scuttles away to the girls'
          Laughter.

          That's enough for today, ladies.
          We don't want you all worn out for
          the ball tonight.
          Kim, Jude and Kelly gather'around with the other girls.

                         JUDE

          Shhh!
          Kelly takes Jude aside as Kim and Vicki approach Henri
          Anne.

          Positive. I heard her say she's
          had the hots for him since they
          met!

                         KIM
          She said that?

          Well, not exactly.

                         HENRI-ANNE
          Oh, Kim. You'll be in the gym
          promptly at three-fifteen for
          rehearsal?

                         KIM
          Well, actually no, Miss Benton.
          can't make it... You know Mr.
          Weller?

          We're... acquainted.

                         VICKI

                         (BLURTS OUT)
          He's got a crush on Kim!

          Kim stares in amazement aL Vicki;

                         HENRI --ANNE
          (staring at Kim)
          He has what?
          Kim, wide-eyed, can only look at Vicki.

                         VICKI
          He keeps making Kim stay after
          school in detention study hall for
          no reason... Just so he can be
          near her.

                         HENRI-ANNE
          That's horrible!
          Kim gulps.

                         HENRI-ANNE

                         (CONTINUING)
          You mean to tell me that awful man
          A girl half his age!
          (a very slight

                         SMILE)
          So you have detention this
          afternoon?
          Kim nods meekly. Lost in thought, Henri-Anne fondles a
          tennis ball, a curious smile playing across her face.

                         HENRI-ANNE

                         (CONTINUING;

                         FINALLY)
          Leave everything to me...
          She hurries away. Kim turns on Vicki and starts to
          protest.

                         VICKI

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          It worked, didn't it?

          67 EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY 67

          Kim and Vicki, and behind them, Jude and Kelly are
          walking back to the gym and the dressing rooms from the
          tennis courts. Vicki's in high spirits and Jude still
          can't stop giggling.
          Vicki spots old Sykes heading out toward the playing
          field. She calls out to him.

          Vicki, don't...

                         VICKI
          Oh, Mr. Sykes...
          Sykes stops, turns around.

                         VICKI

                         (CONTINUING)
          This is just for you...
          She turns, bends over, quickly yanks down her shorts
          and moons him. There's a squeal of laughter from Jude
          and from Kelly. Vicki whips her shorts back up and
          runs to the gym door, the other girls in pursuit.
          Kim looks back at Sykes. He's just standing in the
          field, not moving. There's a look in his eyes.

          68 INT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM - DAY 68

           Kim and Kelly are undressing. Three girls pass them
          headin g for the showers.

                         KELLY
          I'm not like the others, Kim.
          Drew needs somebody like Vicki
          who'll give him what he wants.

                         KIM

                         (LAUGHS)
          Vicki's sex life is more talk than
          action. Besides, Drew wants you.

                         KELLY
          I'm afraid if I don't make it with
          him he'll find somebody who will.

                         KIM

                         (SHRUGS)
          Let him.

                         KELLY
          I'd die if he did...
          The girls wrap towels around themselves and walk to-
          wards the showers.

          69 INTT. SHIER AREA - DAY 69
          A girl (MELANIE) is leaving as Kim and'Kelly enter.
          Wendy is standing in front of a mirror drying her hair.
          Kim ignores her and Wendy returns the compliment.

                         MELANIE
          See you outside, Wendy.

                         WENDY
          Just be a minute...
          Kim and Kelly hang up their towels and step into the
          showers.

                         KELLY
          What about you and Nick?

                         KIM
          What about us?
          Wendy finishes brushing her hair, shoots Kim.a dark
          look, exits.

                         KELLY
          What.happened when he asked you?
          Kim smiles.

                         KIM
          Maybe I asked him...
          Kelly looks at her friend.

          70 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 70

          Wendy finishes buttoning her blouse. She's pulling on
          her jeans when she hears a SCUFFLING SOUND.

                         WENDY
          I'll be right there, Melanie.
          No answer. Curious, Wendy moves around the lockers,
          investigating. The room appears empty.
          There's a sudden LOUD CREAKING. Wendy whirls around.
          A locker door is swinging slowly open.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING)
          Melanie?...
          Still no answer. Shaking her head, Wendy returns to
          her locker.

                         70 CONTINUED: 70
          She's about to shut it when she sees something, a pic-
          ture, taped to the side of the door. It's her photo,
          torn from the School Yearbook. She rips it from the
          door, looks at it.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING)
          What's this for, Melanie?
          Her voice echoes through the empty room. She gazes
          around, fear creeping into her face. She quickly
          finishes dressing, grabs her books, turns to leave.
          Suddenly she screams.

          71 INT. SHOWER AREA 71

          Wendy's SCREAM is all but DROWNED OUT by the SHOWERS.
          Rinsing off, Kim and Kelly hear nothing.

                         KELLY
          I think I'll let Drew do it.
          The door to the locker roor slowly opens behind them.

                         KIM
          Let him?
          She looks at Kelly. Neither girl hears the SQUISH of
          RUBBER SOLES moving across the wet tile floor.
          Suddenly there are LOUD VOICES. Melanie comes through
          from the locker room, laughing. Behind her, Wendy's
          ANGRY WORDS are AUDIBLE.

          WENDY (O.S.)
          If you ever try anything like that
          again, you cow!
          Melanie thinks it's hilarious.

                         MELANIE
          (to Kim and Kelly)
          You should've seen her jump...
          Nadia Comenici never did better...
          Wendy storms in. She's got the photo in her hand. She
          waves it at Kim and Kelly.

                         WENDY
          What's this supposed to mean?

                         (SARCASTIC)
          I know it's not much of a picture,
          Wendy, but you didn't have to go
          that far...
          Wendy is furious.

                         WENDY
          I didn't!
          She turns, glares at Melanie.

                         MELANIE
          Don't look at me...

                         WENDY
          You're all... children...
          She storms out. Melanie looks at Kim and Kelly,
          shrugs, follows Wendy. A DOOR SLAMS in the locker
          room.
          Kim and Kelly look at each other, laugh, turn their
          faces back to the steaming water. Neither one hears
          the SOUND across the room, a HARSH RHYTHMIC HEAVY

          BREATHING.
          Kelly bends her head away from the water, clears her
          eyes., She squints out through the steam at the big
          wall mirror across the room. She sees something. She
          steps back into Kim, her eyes wide with fear.

                         KIM
          Watch it...
          Kelly covers her breasts with her arms, presses against
          the wall, terrified.
          Suddenly there's an EXPLOSION of SOUND. Kim screams,
          jumps back, stares. There's a jagged hole in the cen-
          ter of the mirror, huge cracks radiating from it,
          spidering across its surface.
          For a moment no one moves. Splinters of GLASS TRICKLE
          down to the floor. There's no other sound. Kim grabs
          for her towel, steps out of the shower, looks. There's
          no one. She heads for the locker room door. Kelly
          runs after her.

          72 INT. LOCKER ROOM 72

          Kim rushes into the room, Kelly right behind her.
          There's no one. Kelly is quivering. She clutches at
          Kim's arm. Kim looks at her.

                         KIM
          What did you see?
          Kelly just shakes her head.

                         KELLY
          Just... just... a shadow or.,.
          Kim heads for the exit door across the room. Kelly
          stays with her.

          73 EXT. SCHOOL 73

          Kim opens the outside door, peers down the walkway to
          the tennis courts, playing fields. There's no sign of
          anyone. She closes the door.

          74 INT. LOCKER ROOM 74

          Kim turns back.to Kelly who's started to cry.

                         KELLY
          Someone was there! Someone was...
          in there...
          Kim is taking charge. She moves cautiously back to the
          shower room door, opens it, looks in. She gasps.

                         KELLY

                         (CONTINUING)
          What? What!s wrong?
          Kelly's on the edge of hysteria. She runs over to Kim.
          They both look.

          75 KIM'S AND KELLY'S POV 75
          What the girls see is the mirror. Something has
          changed. A long wedge of glass has been lifted out o
          it.

          76 BACK TO SCENE 76
          Kim shuts the door, presses against it, stares at
          Kelly.

          77 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 77

          Kim walks quickly down a long school corridor and turns
          into her father's office.

          Kim enters. Adele Cooper is seated behind the secre-
          tary's desk thumbing through a fashion magazine.

                         KIM

          Is he here?

                         ADELE
          No, he's not. He said he'd be
          back but...
          She trails off. Kim is obviously upset.

                         ADELE

                         (CONTINUING)
          What's urrong?

                         KIM
          Oh... There was... Somebody broke
          a mirror in the shower room...
          There was somebody in there...

                         ADELE
          A mirror? Seven years bad luck...
          She tries to smile. Kim just looks at her.

          79 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 79

          Kim turns a corner, heading for class, and almost runs
          into Sykes, cleaning the floor. Sykes turns. For a
          moment their eyes lock. Then Kim hurries away, almost
          running. Sykes stares after her.

          80 INT. HALLWAY (WELLER'S CLASSROOM) - DAY 80

           Kim comes down the hallway and stops at the door.
           There's a piece of paper with a hastily scrawled mes-
           sage taped there. It heads: "Detention Postponed
           Until Monday -- EMERGENCY! Weller."

           VICKI (O.S.)
          Did it work?
          Kim is startled, turns. Vicki and Jude and approach-
          ing. Vicki hurries to the door, reads the note.

          She lets out a whoop, embraces Jude. Kim stands back,
          somehow less impressed.

          81 INT. GYM - DAY 81

          Several students are putting last-minute touches on the
          decor as Kim comes in. Huge speakers are being hoisted
          on pulleys to hang from the ceiling. A vast, raised
          platform covers much of the gym floor, its plexiglass
          surface designed to be illuminated from below. Perched
          on a ladder, Weller is hanging shimmering silver strips
          while Henri-Anne Benton supervises from the disco
          floor.

                         HENRI-ANNE
          Careful, Monty... A little
          higher...
          (sees Kim and

                         SMILES)
          I'm glad you could make it!

          Something came up...
          (looks at Weller)
          'Afternoon, Mr. Weller.

                         WELLER

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          Oh, hello, Miss... Hammond. I was
          just... uh...
          Henri-Anne mercifully interrupts him.

                         HENRI-ANNE
          Let's get started.

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Nick!
          Nick pokes his head out of the sound booth set on a
          platform near the stage.

                         HENRI-ANNE

                         (CONTINUING)
          Onstage! Tell Alex we're ready.
          Alex emerges from the booth. DAVY MATLOCK, a pudgy,

          Alex groans. Kim smiles as Nick joins her. She takes
          his hand, clutches it. They start to walk away, talk-
          ing quietly. Nick puts his arm around her.

          Henri-Anne takes Kim to one of the wings of the dark
          cluttered area.

          Nick?
          Nick silently creeps from behind a partition and moves
          up directly behind Henri-Anne. He mimes choking her, a
          crazed expression on his face. Kim has to laugh at his
          clowning.

          not see Wendy and Lou lurking there, watching her.

          Hearing GRUNTS and GROANS from behind the desk, Kim
          steps around and sees Adele Cooper stretched across the
          floor. The secretary is practicing her "Rainbow" exer-

          Adele twists her head around to look at Kim. Her
          "Rainbow" collapses. Spinning around, Adele sits

          taped to her locker door, her picture, ripped out of
          the Winston High Yearbook. She looks at it, reaches up
          and pulls it off the door. She winces, looks at her
          finger. It's bleeding. She looks at the picture.
          There's a tiny sliver of glass embedded in it.

          you home.

                         KIM
          Your secretary?

          Hammond angrily jerks the axe from the stump.

          No. How is she?

                         HAMMOND

                         (SIGHS)
          One minute she's depressed, the
          next she's bubbling over like a
          child... She wants to go with me
          tonight.

                         KIM
          Great!

                         HAMMOND
          I'm not so sure.

                         KIM
          I think getting dressed up and
          going out might be good for her.

          HA",24OND
          She's had a bad day, Kim. I'm not
          sure she can handle it... See if
          you can talk to her.
          Hammond picks up the axe and sends it crashing into the
          stump.

          89 INT. KITCHEN - DUSK 89

          Kim enters from the backyard. Looking around, she no-
          tices that nothing is being prepared for dinner.
          Curious, she moves toward the living room.

          90 INT. LIVING ROOM - DUSK 90

          Vivian is arranging fresh roses on the mantel shrine
          when Kim enters. The girl stands for several seconds
          watching her mother before she speaks.

                         KIM

          Hello, Robin. Don't eat anything.
          Dinner's almost ready.
          Disturbed, Kim frowns and slowly crosses the room to
          her mother.

                         KIM
          Nothing's cooking, Mom. You
          must've forgotten.
          Slipping out of her reverie, Vivian turns around to
          face Kim.

                         VIVIAN
          Oh.. I don't know what I was
          thinking.

                         KIM

                         (SMILES)
          It doesn't matter.

                         (EXCITEDLY)
          Have you seen the new satin
          pantsuit I'm wearing?
          Vivian smiles at her daughter. Kim studies her for a
          long moment, then leans over and kisses her on the
          cheek.

                         KIM
          You'll be beautiful.

          91 INT. HALLWAY - HAMMONDS' HOUSE - DUSK

          As Kim walks down the hallway, she notices that Alex's
          door is closed. She enters her bedroom.

          92 INT. BEDROOM - DUSK 92

          Kim crosses the room and switches ON her RADIO. ROCK
          MUSIC is HEARD as she tosses her books onto the desk
          and moves to the closet. She carefully pulls out her
          prom dress, a mid-length, off-the-shoulder gown in a
          white, clinging material. Holding it up against her
          body, she inspects the gown in the full-length mirror
          on the closet door. Watching her reflection, Kim
          twirls around, hugging the gowm to her body. Satis-
          fied, she gently lays the go%.m on her bed.

          Kim begins to undress. Outside, the twilight shadows
          deepen.
          THROUGH the VINDOM, a slight movement is SEAN among the
          trees; suddenly, a dark figure becomes VISIBLE, ap-
          proaching.the window. Kim does not notice the figure
          as she finishes undressing. She wraps herself in a
          robe and sits at her dressing table.
          Putting her hair up, she does not see the shadowy
          figure peering inside. When Kim stands up, the figure
          slips away from the window. As she crosses the room,
          the face reappears, hidden by the shadows, watching her
          enter the bathroom.

          93 INT. BEDROOM - DUSK 93

          Wearing only a bra and panties, Wendy is sprawled
          across her bed, talking on the telephone. A black silk
          gown is draped across her legs.

                         WENDY
          (into the receiver)
          What I'm wearing now?... Oh,

          stroking the gown)
          You'll find out soon enough.

          Now, are we all set?... It better.
          I don't want her to ever forget
          tonight!... Okay, 'bye.
          Wendy hangs up the receiver and glances at her night
          table. A photograph of a grinning Nick McBride stares
          back. Wendy smiles and caresses her gown.

          94 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 94

          Seated at her dressing table, Kim puts the final touch-
          es on her makeup. Her hair is swept up and back, fall-
          ing in soft waves to her shoulders. Wearing the rav-
          ishing white gown, she looks older and very beautiful.
          Vivian's VOICE is HEARD from down the hall.

          VIVIAN (O.S.)
          Kim!
          Vivian comes in looking anxious and flustered. She's
          dressed in an elegant black satin pantsuit. Kim turns,
          looks at her.

          Vivian doesn't seem to hear her. She's rummaging
          through her purse.

                         VIVIAN
          Kim, have you got any of my
          makeup?

          you...
          Vivian's very wound up.

                         VIVIAN
          It was on my dressing table, I set
          it aside...
          She's looking around Kim's room as if she expects to
          see it.

          She heads for the door, stops, looks fully at Kim for
          the first time.

          95 INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT 95

          Hammond stands in front of a hall mirror, straightening
          his bow tie. He seems agitated, nervous. He turns as
          Vivian starts down the stairs. He looks surprised at
          her outfit. There's a certain similarity between it
          and his own formal suit.

                         HAMIM0ND
          My God, we're going to look like
          twins.
          Vivian stops dead, looks at him. Hammond forces a
          smile.

                         HAMMOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          I'm joking, Vi, it's beautiful.._
          C'mon...
          She hesitates, then comes down to him.

                         VIVIAN
          I told you I'd bought it.

                         HAMMOND
          Of course you did.
          He opens the door for her. She pauses to check herself
          in the mirror.

                         HAMMOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          we've got to go.
          He puts an arm around her, kisses her gently on the
          cheek. She just stares at herself in the mirror.

          96 EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 96

          Hammond takes Vivian's arm as they step outside, walk
          toward the car in the driveway.

          97 INT. PARKED CAR - POV 97

          Someone is watching Hammond and Vivian from a car
          parked across and just down the street. A shadow moves
          in the foreground, in the front seat of the car.

          98 EXT. HOUSE 98

          Hammond guides his wife to their family car, opens the
          passenger door for her_ He looks past her, down the
          street, sees a car parked there.

          A streetlight reflecting off its windshield prevents
          him from seeing inside. Vivian interrupts his
          speculations.

                         VIVIAN
          I'm going back to change.
          She turns back to the house. Hammond holds on to her

          Hammond takes Vivian by the shoulders, faces her.

                         HAMMON D
          Vi.. this is a big night for the
          school, it's a big night for me...
          I know how you're feeling... I
          understand... It's difficult for
          all of us... But we've got to make
          a special effort, Vi... We can't
          let the... terrible memories of
          this day affect us... That may
          seem cold and... insensitive to
          you, but it's the way it has to
          be..

          gaze.

          Whirling around, she sees Alex. Standing up, she pir-

          flower on her gown, she playfully dabs perfume on his
          neck. He pulls back, pricking himself on the pin.

                         ALEX
          Hey!

                         KIM
          You shouldn't have pulled away...
          The DOORBELL RINGS.

                         KIM

                         (CONTINUING)
          It's him!

                         ALE 
          er's face is revealed. It is the nine-year-old Alex.
          Kim cradles the killer on the ground. She turns his
          head toward the light. We SEE his face full-on.

                         VIVIA N
          Robin!
          She rushes forward, lunging for the body. Hammond
          grabs her, restraining her.
          Alex's dark eyes stare back unseeing at his family.
          His resemblance to his dead twin sister is uncanny.
          His hair falls onto his forehead in bangs, as Robin's
          had done seven years before. His makeup has been slop-
          pily applied. The rouged cheeks and the smudged red
          lips amplify the grotesque impersonation.
          Kim strokes her brother's hair. Hammond presses his
          hysterical wife to him. The onlookers slowly close in.
          We SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM Alex's face TO a photograph of
          the Hammond family taken seven years earlier. We MOVE
          IN CLOSE ON the twins. Alex and Robin are smiling.

          FADE OUT.

               With the sound of wind, of sand gritting against glass:

               FADE UP ON:

               A howling dust storm battering the doors and walls of a tiny 
               woodplank church.

               Inside, huddled together against the rage outside, are a 
               small group of people. All in black, mostly elderly, they 
               kneel in prayer.

               Before them, on the cramped altar, lies a man. Dressed in 
               the uniform of a general, surrounded by the silk softness of 
               his casket.

               He's an old man, far from the crump of battles, consumed now 
               with stillness, listening to the prayers of old people. Of 
               desert wind, moaning through thin wood.

               The candle beside his head flickers and wanes in the ceaseless 
               gusts, strains for life, then goes out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

               It's not the best part of town and probably never was. A 
               place of seedy, anonymous brick flophouses shackled by rusting 
               fire escapes, lying on an alley unique only for its bad 
               drainage. It's here, in the dim, flinty light, that a figure 
               enters.

               Wearing a long coat and, despite the night, sunglasses, he 
               pauses on the slimy asphalt and gazes up the sides of the 
               flophouses, to their yellowish windows and competing Mexican 
               radio stations. One window, dark and quiet on the third floor, 
               catches his gaze.

               There's a metal hand railing in the alley that the long-coated 
               figure effortlessly pops up onto. Sunglasses focused on the 
               window, he lowers himself into a motionless crouch, a perch, 
               on the railing with the ease of a crow. Or a gargoyle.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Dawn is a muddled, limp thing that does nothing to improve 
               the alley. The figure is still there, a motionless gargoyle 
               perched on the railing. Watching the window.

               The shadows shorten, the air grows warmer, and now there's 
               movement behind the window.

               The sunglassed gargoyle drops down off the railing, jumps up 
               to the first rung of the fire escape, and begins climbing.

               BEHIND THE THIRD FLOOR WINDOW

               Is a room as grim as we expect. Lumpy iron bed, sink that's 
               been pissed into one too many times, and SIMON; a man in a 
               tight sweater and dark sunglasses, busily emptying his pockets 
               on the ruined dresser: loose change, a town paper's obituary 
               column.

               Simon's sunglassed eyes look up suddenly, his body 
               stifffening. He whips around to face the window just as it 
               EXPLODES into fragments.

               The gargoyle LEAPS into the room on the trail of glass. Simon 
               spins and THROWS himself against the intruder. The two 
               STRUGGLE savagely across the room, SMASHING chairs.

               Simon manages a grip on the gargoyle's face and POUNDS the 
               back of his skull against the wall. The gargoyle gets his 
               locked fists up and SWINGS them like a war club, SMACKING 
               Simon's face and SPRAWLING him backwards onto the bed.

               The two, across the room for each other, pause.

                                     GARGOYLE
                         Where is it?

               Simon's climbed to his feet, the two men in sunglasses now 
               walking slow circles around each other.

                                     SIMON
                         Leave me alone.

                                     GARGOYLE
                         You've found it, haven't you?

                                     SIMON
                         Fuck you.

               The gargoyle drops his head and DRIVES himself into Simon, 
               who HAMMERS the gargoyle with his fists. Blood SMEARS.

               The gargoyle's gotten free a knife that he JAMS into Simon's 
               leg. Pressing home his advantage, the gargoyle SLAMS Simon 
               up against the wall. He TEARS open Simon's shirt, digging 
               his fingers into the chest, RIPPING the skin aside, the first 
               plunging deep, CRACKING the sternum bone, pushing even 
               further, toward the blood gouged pumping beneath --

               -- Simon PLOWS his knee up between the gargoyle's legs. Over 
               and over. Till the grip loosens and Simon SHOVES him to one 
               side, using the momentum and drives to SWING the body around 
               and at the shattered window. The gargoyle SMACKS the frame 
               and COLLAPSES, his head CRACKING on the sill and FORCING a 
               shard of glass through his neck.

               Simon moves to the window and brushes aside the gargoyle's 
               sunglasses, revealing two totally empty eye sockets. Pushing 
               his thumbs into them, Simon uses the leverage to lift the 
               gargoyle off the sill and push his body out the window.

               The gargoyle bounces once on the fire escape, then spread-
               eagles thirty feet to the asphalt.

               Somebody turns up their Mexican radio station.

               The gargoyle's a wreck.

               But he manages, slowly -- his shattered remains arguing every 
               inch -- to climb first to his knees, then miserably to his 
               feet. A bent, splattered, hopeless thing that manages to 
               stumble three or four feet before being HIT by a freeway-
               speed firebird BOMBING down the alley.

               The impact PINS the gargoyle to the grill and RAMS him into 
               a brick wall, CRUSHING a chest that BELCHES out a sickly, 
               bruised heart like a wet rag against the firebird's 
               windshield.

               THREE FLOORS ABOVE

               Simon leans against his splintered window and looks down at 
               the pinned and very finished body of the gargoyle. His own 
               shirt and pants are a mess of torn blood and his breathing 
               is difficult. Pain flashes across his forehead as he checks 
               that his own sunglasses still sit snugly on the bridge of 
               his nose.

               At the sound of a distant siren Simon turns and quickly 
               finishes packing his duffle bag. Stiffly pulling on an 
               oversize surplus army jacket that partly conceals the damage 
               beneath, he picks up the bag and painfully shuffles out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The gargoyle, still pinned to the wall by the firebird.

               A FLASH bounces off his skin. Then another. He's being 
               photographed. Go wide and find him in the middle of a police 
               investigation. Bored blue uniforms, yellow barrier tape. The 
               usual.

               A plain jane sedan pulls up and deposits THOMAS DAGGET, 
               thirties, tweed coat and steel notebook. He smiles at a couple 
               of cops, ducks under the yellow barrier, and nods a greeting 
               to an older uniform sergeant, BURROWS.

                                     THOMAS DAGGET
                         Hey.

                                     BURROWS
                         Hey.

                              (looks up at sky)
                         Thought those clouds this morning 
                         spelled rain for sure, but it's turned 
                         into a beautiful day, wouldn't you 
                         say, Sergeant Burrows?

               Thomas takes a deep, healthy breath. Burrows just stares at 
               him.

                                     BURROWS
                         I warned you about that cheerful 
                         shit.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Sorry. I'm working on it.

               He eyes finally make their way to the gargoyle.

                                     BURROWS
                         Friend here did a half-gainer with a 
                         firebird tuck from the third floor.

                         Not unless he decided not to bother 
                         opening the window first.

                         to walk a chalk line when we got 
                         here. You're welcome to try and smell 
                         his breath if you like, that is if 
                         you can find the mouth.

               Burrows nods in the direction of a very shook up young man 
               sitting on the curb.

                                     BURROWS
                         Mr. Jiminez. Was taking a short cut 
                         to his job at a packing plant on San 
                         Pedro. First thing he remembers about 
                         the deceased is several vital organs 
                         bouncing off his windshield.

                         missing one or two things, though.

                         but the eyes are still AWOL. Might

               Burrows and Thomas coming up the stairs.

                         There are, what an intelligent, 
                         experienced detective like yourself 
                         could possibly construe as signs of 
                         a struggle.

               They enter the room, which is, of course, totally trashed. 
               Thomas steps over the splintered furniture.

                                     BURROWS
                         Naturally nobody saw or heard 
                         anything.

                         In such a fine establishment as this?

               Thomas looks at the splashes of blood, overturned dressers, 
               a newspaper, the "Chimney Rock Republican"; one name in its

                                                        DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO:

               The sun sinking beneath the horizon of a vast and undulating 
               expanse of desert.

               Travel through the landscape as the sky purples and darkens 
               and silhouettes tall, finger-like spires of volcanic rock. 
               Hear the coyotes, the wind making its constant, probing 
               search. Before the night swallows it all whole,

               Come upon The Town.

               It used to be something. But that's long gone. Now, wrapped 
               in the sucking blackness of a wilderness night, it's a shell 
               of a place.

               Lights still burn in some of the windows but fool no one. 
               The ghosts are the majority here. Biding their time. Waiting 
               for The Town to surrender and slip beneath the waves of the 
               desert.

               The wind slinks over the hills, creeps down past boarded-up 
               storefronts, skeletal ocitillo, and the rusting hulks of 
               abandoned mining equipment. The corpse of a summer's kite 
               twists slowly on a power line.

               ON THE EDGE OF TOWN

               From the inky oblivion of the road, comes a crunch of gravel.

               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN

               Stands a large, nineteenth century brick schoolhouse. An 
               icon from a more prosperous past, its dark massiveness was 
               meant for scores of ruddy-faced miner's kids. Now it seems 
               to be imploding, eating itself with creeping decay. On this 
               night it is silent and dark but for a small glow in one corner 
               and the faint sound of children's voices in song.

               It is a hymn. An ancient, Latin one. The melancholy beauty 
               of voices rising and falling in choir.

               INSIDE THE BUILDING

               Is a school auditorium. On the stage, dwarfed by it, are 
               twenty five students from first grade to high school, singing 
               together as a choir. A young woman, KATHERINE, directs their 
               acapella voices as the small group of parents, lonely in the 
               huge room, look on.

               OUTSIDE

               The voices drift on the night, down the road, and lap against 
               the peeling facade of a storefront. A mortuary.

               INSIDE

               The rooms are dark but for one. There, bathed in the 
               flickering light of a tall candle, lies the body of the old 
               general we saw at the opening.

               THE FRONT DOOR

               Of the mortuary has a locked handle that jiggles from outside. 
               A small panes of glass beside it is BROKEN by a hand.

               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

               Young voices struggle with the complicated hymn and its pain 
               of centuries. Faces white, Mexican, Navaho. Katherine guides 
               them with soft hands. She smiles in pride. They smile back. 
               Proud. Of her. Of themselves and the beauty coming from their 
               mouths.

               One small, beautiful navaho girl, MARY, maybe eight, gets a 
               special smile of special friendship from Katherine.

               THE MORTUARY'S

               Front door now stands ajar in the darkness. Small shards of 
               glass glisten in the carpet.

               INSIDE

               Is the dead General. Even in the bleached ravages of age and 
               death, his face still holds a shadow of vigor and pride.

               It takes a moment in the weak flicker of the candle to realize 
               someone is there with him. Simon in his oversized surplus 
               jacket. His arms are folded tightly across his middle, as if 
               in deep cold. But his gaunt face is moist with sweat and his 
               breath is shallow and uneven. He stares at the old man behind 
               sunglasses and takes slow, cautious steps forward into the 
               amber glow.

               Holding out two blood-stained fingers, Simon touches the 
               General's forehead. A new strain crosses his perspiring face. 
               Concentration.

               Placing his right palm on the General's chin and the left on 
               his forehead, Simon CRACKS OPEN the dead man's mouth.

               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

               The hymn is reaching its aching climax of medieval longing.

               IN THE MORTUARY

               Simon leans down to the open mouth, and in a voice soft and 
               deeply weary,

                                     SIMON
                         Qui ex Patre Flioque procedit...

               Then, with the school choir distant and faint in the night, 
               the living man places his mouth over that of the dead man...

               IN THE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

               It's coffee and cake now as parents proudly hug their children 
               and congratulate their young teacher. Even in this gloomy, 
               crumbling building it's a warm, small town moment.

               OUTSIDE

               Simon has left the mortuary and now limps with difficulty 
               through the silent streets, leaning against shop walls for 
               support.

               AT THE SCHOOL BUILDING

               Through the doors out steps the eight year old Navaho girl, 
               Mary. Alone, she stands on the stone stairs and looks out 
               into the night with sensitive eyes. She concentrates. Knows.

               Katherine follows her out.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Hey bright eyes, what's the deal 
                         being out here all alone without a 
                         coat?

               The girl's eyes seem too serious for a child's. Too 
               perceptive.

                                     MARY
                         Someone's here.

               Katherine looks out into the night.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Where?

               Mary stares a moment longer, then becomes a child again, 
               smiling and popping Katherine one on the arm.

                                     MARY
                         Pig out on all the cake?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Oh, there might be one, tiny, skinny 
                         piece left, but you're gonna have to 
                         race me for it.

               Mary suddenly points past Katherine's shoulder.

                                     MARY
                         What's that?

               When Katherine turns Mary dashes back into the building.

                                     MARY
                         Ha!

                                     KATHERINE
                         You little sneak!

               Katherine chases after her.

               AT THAT MOMENT

               Simon comes limping up from the road. His breathing's bad 
               now as he moves stiffly along the school's brick walls, coming 
               to an old, rusty back door he creaks open and slides through.

               INSIDE

               He climbs a littered and disused staircase, past broken beer 
               bottles and condom wrappers to a dark and creaky second floor.

               It's part of the school building long abandoned. Doors to 
               classrooms lie half off their hinges, windows are broken, 
               rats squeak between ancient desks stacked like funeral pyres.

               Simon, his breath echoing in the cold darkness, shuffles 
               along the broken linoleum till he comes to a rectangle cut 
               in the wall where a row of lockers used to be. He crawls 
               into the space and there, surrounded by rot, curls up on 
               himself and sucks his thumb.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. APARTMENT

               Thomas Dagget's eyes opening slowly. He sits up in his bed, 
               runs a hand through his hair, and looks out with only medium 
               enthusiasm at the morning.

               INT. CHURCH

               Thomas lights an offering candle and kneels for a brief, 
               silent prayer. He crosses himself, stands, and walks for the 
               door. Before leaving he glances back at the altar. A 
               questioning moment between two akward, estranged friends.

               INT. POLICE CENTER

               Thomas sits at his desk half-heartily trying to make sense 
               of the three dozen files piled there. Lt. Paul, his boss, 
               leans against a wall nearby.

                         this morning. I'll be right over.

               INT. CORONER'S OFFICE

               A set of golf clubs rest forelornly in the corner. An 
               irritable looking coroner fumes behind his desk as Thomas 
               enters.

                         them -- except your man. That would,

               looking leather bound book.

               INT. POLICE OFFICE

               Thomas at his desk, working under a lone gooseneck lamp. 
               He's translating the fourteenth chapter of St. John's 
               Revelations from Latin onto a slip of paper. Finished, he 
               sets the ancient bible down, turns off the gooseneck, and 
               leans back in his chair, alone in the dark.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DESERT - EARLY MORNING

               Here, outside The Town, horizons are distant, faraway things. 
               The sky overhead is streaked red and blue with barely morning 
               as the screen door of a simple stucco house swings open. 
               It's Katherine, the teacher. Wearing levis and boots, she 
               carries a saddle swung over one denim shoulder out to a corral 
               behind the house where a horse shuffles and whinnies 
               impatiently.

                                     KATHERINE
                         In a minute, in a minute...

               Katherine throws the saddle over the horse and cinches it 
               down as the sun, still tucked behind pink and grey cliffs, 
               begins to heat up the sky.

               EXT. SANDSTONE CANYON - MORNING

               Deep and narrow, an idyllic canyon of compressed sandstone 
               walls smoothed, rounded and etched by centuries of wind. A 
               tiny creek flows past weak banks of scrub pine and pocked 
               sycamore. A silent place a long way and a long time from 
               anything but the approach of galloping hooves.

               Katherine and her horse run full-out through the canyon, the 
               clack and splash of hooves echoing off steep, shadowed walls. 
               Horse and rider drive each other harder and harder, their 
               hot breath brief clouds in the arch, thin desert air.

               Boulders shattered by winter cold and summer heat, deep wind-
               cut caves hiding scorpions, sidewinders, or a wary mountain 
               lion all pass as in a blur; arrogant hawks and patient 
               buzzards, ruins of thousand year old Anasazi villages high 
               on the cliffs, their weather-beaten skulls, seen and unseen, 
               staring out; everything is one smear of color and smell as 
               Katherine gallops past them and up the cliff trail, out of 
               the canyon, and onto the main plateau.

               ON THE PLATEAU

               Katherine strokes her horse and feeds it a bag of carrots. 
               She pulls a thermos from the pack, sits down against some 
               old man rocks, and with the coffee steaming in her hand, 
               greets the sun now cresting the Chuska Mountains.

               There's a rutted, silty dirt road nearby. An ancient, battered 
               school bus rattles its way past and stops. The bus driver, a 
               Navaho, JOHN, climbs down and rubbing the side of his head 
               painfully walks up to Katherine.

                                     JOHN
                         You could save my life with some 
                         coffee.

               He holds out an empty cup Katherine fills. Sipping painfully, 
               he lays down beside her and pulls the brim of his baseball 
               cap over his eyes.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Tough night?

                                     JOHN
                         You don't want to hear about it.
                              (peeks out hopefully)
                         Or maybe you do.

                                     KATHERINE
                         No thanks.

                                     JOHN
                         Just checking.

               The bus is full of young school kids.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Shouldn't they be getting to school?

                                     JOHN
                         Impromptu field trip. I'm broadening 
                         their minds. And sparing them the 
                         sight of their beloved chauffeur 
                         barfing his guts out.

               Katherine's horse snorts.

                                     JOHN
                         I hate horses. How was the canyon? 
                         Honey-suckle out yet?

                                     KATHERINE

                                     JOHN
                         I hate that canyon. I hate this this 
                         whole plateau. Too many goddamn

                         Just got to give it a chance.

                                     JOHN

                         Thank you.

               He finishes the coffee and climbs painfully to his feet.

                                     JOHN
                         Thanks for the joe.

                                     KATHERINE

                         You're a credit to the community.

               He shuffles back to the bus.

                                     JOHN
                         All right children, looks sharp! 
                         This is a school day! And no talking 
                         loud!

               The bus coughs alive and crawls forward. Katherine waves to 
               the faces behind glass, then settles back for a last moment 
               of peace as silence lays again over the land.

               EXT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY

               Showered and changed into her teaching clothes, Katherine 
               climbs into a rattling pickup.

               EXT. THE TOWN

               Katherine drives to work, passing on the outskirts the closed 
               copper mine, vast and abandoned. Down beyond the fading main 
               street lies the great crumbling brick pile that is the school. 
               Katherine parks her truck, grabs her leather bag, and walks 
               in.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Katherine's lecturing her students. All twenty-five of them. 
               There's high school age sons of white ranchers, Navaho girls 
               on the edge of puberty, tiny Mexican children. All being 
               taught together in one room.

               It's dinosaur day. Katherine has a large fossilized bone on 
               her lap.

                                     KATHERINE
                         This is "Camposaurus". Camposaurus 
                         was a herbavore, which meant he only 
                         ate plants. Camposaur stayed mostly 
                         to himself and never bothered anyone.

               The little girls smile. They like Camposaurus. Katherine 
               holds up another bone fragment.

                                     KATHERINE
                         This is a leg fragment that belongs 
                         to the killer of the plateau, 
                         Alosaurus. Alosaurus was a vicious 
                         carnivore, which meant he'd eat 
                         anything that moved, especially nice, 
                         juicy Camposaurs.

               The little boys grin. They like Alosaurus.

                         Both these guys lived together right 
                         here on the White Rock plateau eighty 
                         million years ago, when this area 
                         used to be on the banks of a huge, 
                         shallow sea. Remember how we talked 
                         about how sedimentation fossilizes 
                         bones? That's also what made the 
                         hills out behind our town and put 
                         the copper in the ground.

               Katherine lifts off the desk an ancient 1950s gieger counter 
               and switches it on. It ticks softly when she points it at 
               the dino bone.

                         And bombs Alex, yes, is all through 
                         these hills naturally. Millions of 
                         years ago the dinosaurs here ate 
                         plants and drank water which had 
                         uranium in it that became concentrated 
                         in their bones, which is exactly 
                         how, with Mr. Geiger counter here, 
                         we're going to find some.

               The class CHEERS.

               EXT. HILL - DAY

               With the brick schoolhouse tiny in the background, Katherine's 
               class trudges its way up the barren, rocky hillside behind 
               the town. The teenage rancher's kids try to make time with 
               the Mexican girls One of the little boys has gotten into a 
               shoving match with a little girl.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (coming between them)
                         -- Hey. Come on. What's the deal, 
                         Brian?

               The girl folds her arms defiantly. The boy is pissed, 
               embarrassed.

                                     BRIAN
                         She...

                                     KATHERINE
                         Yes?

                                     BRIAN
                         ...She, she called me a "Dick Head".

                                     KATHERINE
                         Sandra?

                                     SANDRA
                         Well, he is.

                                     KATHERINE
                         All right, Brian. You get one free 
                         insult. Make it good.

               Brian concentrates.

                                     PAUL
                         You... You're a... Cow Demon!

                                     KATHERINE
                              (beat)
                         Uh... Okay. Everybody satisfied?
                              (looks at Brian)
                         Cow Demon?

               UP ON THE HILL

               Katherine's given the geiger counter to the little Navaho 
               girl, Mary. Focusing grimly on the rock in front of her, 
               Mary guides the detector over the stones till suddenly it 
               begins clicking softly.

                                     MARY
                         I got one! I got one!

               The high school kids come up and help dig.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Easy... Easy... Don't break it.

               Almost immediately, an eye socket appears in the dust.

               As the students carefully brush away the dust, Katherine 
               looks back across the crumbly path. A coyote has crept up 
               onto a near ledge. It just stands there. Watching her.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BIG CITY CHURCH

               It's mostly empty at this time of day and the young man 
               sitting in the pew, staring at the altar, is alone. His name 
               is GABRIEL and he wears jeans, a faded leather jacket, and 
               dark sunglasses, even inside. His thin hair is slicked back 
               and there's an almost feminine quality about him.

               He sits there a moment longer, staring, then gets up and 
               leaves.

               EXT. DOWNTOWN ALLEY

               The alley from the beginning. Gabriel pulls his old, 
               convertible rambler to a stop and walks into the flophouse.

               INT. FLOPHOUSE

               He comes upstairs to the landing, where the door to the room 
               is covered with a strip of yellow tape: POLICE INVESTIGATION. 
               DO NOT ENTER.

               Gabriel pulls the tape aside and KICKS the door open.

               INSIDE

               It's still the disaster we remember. Gabriel walks slowly 
               through the room. He scratches up some blood, tastes it.

               There's spray-painted outlines where the police have removed 
               certain items. Gabriel takes note of this, tastes the blood 
               again, and leaves.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. KATHERINE'S CLASSROOM BUILDING - DAY

               It's lunch break. Most of the students sit in loose cliques 
               around the front of the building; eating, skipping rope, 
               picking fights.

               INSIDE

               The recently unearthed skull sits on Katherine's desk. Feet 
               up beside it, she leans back in her chair looking through a 
               dinosaur book. One of her students, a twelve year old boy, 
               finishes cleaning up the floor and stands beside her.

                                     BOY
                         I'm all done with the cleaning, Miss 
                         Henley.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Thank you, Jason. I appreciate it.

                                     BOY
                              (looking at book over 
                              her shoulder)
                         Find out what it is, yet?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Well, it's either a 44 million year 
                         old Strychtosaurus or that cow Mr. 
                         Sorenson lost last winter.

               The boy, still standing beside her, begins to look nervous. 
               Slowly, he lets his weight rest against Katherine's shoulder. 
               She smiles good naturedly up at him.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go eat your lunch, Jason.

               The boy immediately stiffens and begins backing up, almost 
               relieved.

                                     BOY
                         Sure, Miss Henley. Thanks. See ya.

               Katherine watches him leave, smiles again, and goes back to 
               the book.

               AROUND THE BACK OF THE BUILDING

               On the abandoned back stairs, a couple of Mexican boys sit 
               smoking cigarettes. They whistle and kid with the four young 
               girls that pass them going up the steps.

               UPSTAIRS

               Is the abandoned, decayed part of the building. The four 
               girls know they're not supposed to be here and that's probably 
               half the fun. They run through the crumbling halls, giggling 
               and hiding from one another. Their cries, the smack of their 
               shoes, echo off off the peeling halls.

               One of them is Mary, running down a hall, banging a stick 
               with another girl. At a corner Mary peels off from her friend, 
               runs down a new hall, turns a corner,

               And comes on Simon. He's still curled where we last saw him, 
               in the wall niche where some lockers used to be. The two 
               stare at one another. Finally,

                                     MARY
                         Hi.

                                     SIMON
                         Hi.

                                     MARY
                         What's your name?

                                     SIMON
                         Simon.

                                     MARY
                         You don't look so good, Simon.

                                     SIMON
                         No, I don't.

                                     MARY
                         I'm Mary.

                                     SIMON
                         Hello Mary.

                                     MARY
                         Does Miss Henley know you're here?

                                     SIMON
                         No one does, Mary. Can we keep it 
                         just our secret. For a little while?

               Mary thinks.

                                     MARY
                         Okay.

               You can hear her friends coming closer.

                                     MARY
                         I have to go.

                                     SIMON
                         It was nice meeting you, Mary.

               Mary goes to leave, stops, turns back.

                                     MARY
                         Are you hungry? I could bring 
                         something.

                                     SIMON
                         That would be very nice.

                                     MARY
                         Okay. Bye.

               She smiles and runs down the hall. Simon grits his teeth, 
               turns to the wall, and prepares himself for a long, long 
               day.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               An old fifties two-level, Polynesian lamps and glitter stucco, 
               now faded and browinish with water stains. Gabriel, the young 
               man with the sunglasses and leather jacket we last saw kicking 
               down the door at the flophouse, walks up the apartment's 
               stairs to the second level, knocks once, and opens the door.

               THE APARTMENT INSIDE

               Hasn't been very well looked after lately. Either has the 
               occupant. Sitting slumped in a kitchen chair, staring at the 
               floor, he peers through dully yellow eyes that barely seem 
               to register his visitor.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Gee Jerry, you look like shit.

               The eyes lift to Gabriel, revealing a pale, bloodless face 
               eaten with dried sores.

                                     JERRY
                         Leave me alone, Gabriel.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Soon, pal. Soon.

               Gabriel drops into the chair across from Jerry and pushes 
               aside with distaste the maggot-ridden plates of food piled 
               on the table. He reaches his hand out to Jerry.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Come here.

                                     JERRY
                         Go away.

                                     GABRIEL
                              (sing-song, like to a 
                              baby)
                         Come here...

               Gabriel puts his hand under Jerry's chin and turns the face 
               side to side, examining the cracked, decaying skin and filmy 
               eyes.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hmmm. Still a little life left in 
                         you. Barely.

                                     JERRY
                         Fuck you.

               Gabriel releases Jerry's chin and slouches down in the chair.

                                     GABRIEL
                         There's something I want you to do 
                         for me.

                                     JERRY
                         What a surprise.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't be that way.

                                     JERRY
                         I just want to... Why won't you let 
                         me...

                                     GABRIEL
                         I will, I will. Promise.

               A dark, intestinal looking amber fluid begins to pool out of 
               Jerry's pant leg.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You need some new clothes, son.

               A tear wells in Jerry's decomposing face.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Aw come on, don't start. You know 
                         how I hate that...

                                     JERRY
                         I'm so tired. I'm so goddamn tired.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Watch the profanity. -- Just one 
                         more favor. Honest.

                                     JERRY
                              (deep sigh)
                         What?

                                     GABRIEL
                         I want you to get something for me. 
                         A few personal effects the cops ripped 
                         off from the lovely Allenwood Arms 
                         on Seventh Street. It'll be sitting 
                         in their property room down on San 
                         Julian.

                                     JERRY
                         I'm supposed to just go in there? 
                         Like this?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Give you a bath, put on some decent 
                         clothes,
                              (beat)
                         Maybe a very large brim hat, you'll 
                         be fine. Just go in between five and 
                         five-ten, it's a shift change and 
                         nobody'll notice you.

               The SLAM of a racquetball against the scarred white wall of 
               an indoor court. It ricochets off the ceiling, hits the back 
               glass partition, and is SLAMMED again. Four players, including 
               Thomas, grunt and sweat across the hardwood floor. It's 
               brutal. Shoulders and knees bang off one another.

               One of the players falls back, yells to Thomas.

               Thomas dives into position to make the save, recovers, and 
               yells to the player as he dashes to the next corner.

               Another player picks up the dead ball and puts his arm around

                         You're missing the point of the game, 
                         Thomas. You must absolutely trust no 
                         one. Form alliances, but break them. 
                         Lure another to trust you, then betray 
                         him! You play with too much honor. 
                         Sink to the gutter. Use people. Lie 
                         and double-cross them.

               Player #2 tosses the ball to Thomas, who serves, and the 
               scuffling is back on. Shouts to one another. Promises of 
               support.

                         together!

               Thomas and Player #2 team up on a third player, pressing him 
               hard. Suddenly Thomas breaks back, intercepts the ball, and 
               drives against Player #2. The about-face is too abrupt for 
               him and Player #2 is eliminated in a double-cross. He smiles 
               proudly at Thomas.

                         bible stuff. But this implies there 
                         was a second war. That's news to me.

                         Oh, it's a fairly common theological 
                         debate. Or was. The idea that if 
                         Christ is God's son, does that make 
                         him less than God or are they the 
                         same being in different forms. That 
                         very argument almost tore the early 
                         Christian church apart in the 4th 
                         Century. That was the good old days 
                         when people actually worried about 
                         theology. Anyway, it was settled 
                         when the bishops of the world got to 
                         together at the Council of Nicene in 
                         325 and hashed out the various 
                         interpretations of scripture into a 
                         uniform dogma of belief. The result 
                         was the Nicene Creed, which basically 
                         said that Christ was in fact the 
                         same as God and was owed the same 
                         power and respect as the Father. 
                         That they were the same.

               There's nobody around the back door and its unlocked. Jerry's 
               shrunken claws pull it open.

               INSIDE

               Is a crush of filing cabinets and erector-set shelves. All 
               of it crammed with low grade stuff. The heroin busts and 
               million dollar currency arrests don't end up here. Here it's 
               all shoe boxes and dusty files. Fragments of small lives 
               forgotten.

               Jerry pulls the brim of his hat down even further as he works 
               his way past rack after rack. The single uniform he meets 
               looks only casually at Jerry's lapel ID badge. It's on the 
               third shelf he finds it. John Doe #78. Jerry lifts the box 
               and walks out.

               INT. COUNTY BUILDING BASEMENT

               Gabriel steps off the elevator and follows the signs for 
               MEDICAL EXAMINER. Along the way he passes a checkpoint guard.

                                     GUARD
                         Need a pass, friend.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I'll just be a second.

                                     GUARD
                         C'mon...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Sorry.

               Gabriel walks back to the guard, smiles, and KNOCKS him clean 
               out of his chair with the back of his arm. The guard SMACKS 
               against the wall and crumples out of view.

               INT. MORGUE

               Tiled floor and refrigerated corpses. Nobody's around when 
               Gabriel enters. He walks over to a file cabinet and removes 
               a thick folder. Then he walks to the big filing cabinets, 
               the ones that hold a body in each drawer. He strolls along, 
               tapping each label till he finds the one he's looking for, 
               slides it open, and looks down at the naked body of the 
               gargoyle.

               He's been sewed back together. Kind of. Gabriel grabs the 
               eyeless corpse under the armpits and drags him out onto the 
               floor where he pushes the legs together and outstretches the 
               arms, like a crucifix. From his coat Gabriel takes out a 
               small vial of oil and rubs it onto the gargoyle's feet and 
               hands. Anointing them. Then with the tip of his finger, he 
               draws a faint sign of the cross on the forehead, stands, and 
               walks for the door.

               In the background, as Gabriel leaves, we see the body of the 
               gargoyle BURST into flame.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. KATHERINE'S SCHOOL

               Katherine's students are shuffling back from lunch to their 
               seats, making small talk and paper airplanes. Katherine does 
               a head count, then stops a young boy coming through the door.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Brian, have you seen Mary?

                                     BRIAN
                         I think she's out back somewhere.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (to girl)
                         Allison?

                                     ALLISON
                         We haven't seen her since lunch.

                                     KATHERINE
                         We're you guys up in the...

               The girls, Mary's friends, shrug innocently. Katherine sighs.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Okay everybody, get started on today's 
                         reading. Quietly. I'll be right back.

               Katherine closes the door behind her. The class immediately 
               erupts into goofing off. The door opens again.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I mean quiet.

               IN THE ABANDONED PART OF THE BUILDING

               Katherine walks through decayed and rusting halls.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (calls out)
                         Mary...

               It's spooky up here. A part of the building Katherine clearly 
               dislikes.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary...
                              (to herself)
                         Shit.

               Katherine calls out Mary's name a few more times, turns a 
               few more corners, and suddenly comes on her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary?

               Mary's sitting beside Simon, the bleeding, ashen-faced man 
               with sunglasses. She's giving Simon a piece of sandwich and 
               a coke. Katherine is instantly wary.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary, come here.

                                     MARY
                         But Simon and I were --

                                     KATHERINE
                         Come here.

               Mary reluctantly walks over to Katherine.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go back to class.

                                     MARY
                         But --

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go.

               Mary frowns, waves once to Simon, and leaves. There's a 
               heaviness to the air around Simon. A kind of buzzing. 
               Katherine blinks her eyes a few times. Focuses.

                                     SIMON
                         She wasn't doing any harm.

                                     KATHERINE
                         It's not her I'm worried about.

                                     SIMON
                         Of course.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What are you doing here?

                                     SIMON
                         Small job. Mostly done now. Just 
                         passing through.

                                     KATHERINE
                         This is school property, you can't 
                         sleep here.

                                     SIMON
                         It wasn't part of the plan. Honest.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (notices blood stains)
                         Are you all right?

                                     SIMON
                         No. Not really.

               That buzz. Katherine rubs the side of her temple.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I'll have to call the police.

                                     SIMON
                         I wish you wouldn't, but I understand.

                                     KATHERINE
                         They'll help you.

                                     SIMON
                         Oh, I rather doubt that.

               Katherine turns and leaves, her footsteps fading. Mary appears 
               again.

                                     MARY
                         Hi.

                                     SIMON
                         Hello. I thought you'd left.

                                     MARY
                         I hid. I'm very clever.

                                     SIMON
                         I'm sure you are.
                              (beat)
                         You were nice to give me the food.

                                     MARY
                         I know.

                                     SIMON
                         I haven't much time, Mary. And since 
                         you've been so nice to me, there's 
                         something I'd very much like to give 
                         to you.

                                     MARY
                         What?

                                     SIMON
                         Just for a little while. Something 
                         very special. Can you keep it a 
                         secret? The biggest secret ever?

                                     MARY
                         Yes. What is it?

                                     SIMON
                         Come here, Mary.

               She takes a couple of shy steps toward him.

                                     SIMON
                         Closer...

               As she does --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Katherine, outside the building, rounding up some of the 
               kids who decided to take an impromptu recess. Hustling the 
               last one up the stairs, she pauses suddenly. She hears 
               something. Faint coughing.

               Katherine walks back around the side of the building and 
               sees Mary bent over, vomiting. Katherine rushes up to her.

                                     MARY
                         I don't feel good...

                                     KATHERINE
                         What's the matter, pumpkin? Did you 
                         eat something?
                              (concerned beat)
                         Did he give you something?

               Mary coughs up the last of her lunch.

                                     MARY
                         Can I go home now?

               Katherine wipes off Mary's mouth with a hanky.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Sure, hon. Let's go.

               EXT. TOWN - DAY

               Katherine drives Mary home, a dusty, tired mobile home slumped 
               among the saguaro and tumbleweed on the edge of town.

               INT. MOBILE HOME

               Mary and Katherine pull open the door and enter. Mary's 
               elderly grandmother is sitting watching "All My Children". 
               She smiles at Katherine and looks at Mary with concern as 
               the little girl rubs her stomach and explains something in 
               Navaho.

               IN THE BEDROOM

               Katherine helps tuck Mary in bed as her grandmother brings a 
               glass of water.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I'll have the school send over a 
                         doctor.

               The grandmother sits beside Mary, whispers gently in Navaho, 
               and softly stokes her brow.

               IN THE LIVING ROOM

                                     KATHERINE
                              (on the phone)
                         ...He's was just laying up there. I 
                         thought, with the kids and 
                         everything...

                                     VOICE
                         Most of my boys are up the highway 
                         on a tanker spill at the moment. 
                         They may be a while. These people 
                         are rarely any problem. I'll have a 
                         deputy come by tonight or tomorrow 
                         and shoo him out.

                                     KATHERINE
                         He looked hurt.

                                     VOICE
                         They all do, ma'am. Inside or out, 
                         they're all damaged goods.

               IN THE BEDROOM

               Alone and tucked into bed, Mary stares off at something very, 
               very far away.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THOMAS'S APARTMENT

               The sun orange and fading outside his window, Thomas drifts 
               off into a nap on his couch. The phone rings.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Yeah.

                                     VOICE
                         It's your friendly coroner.

                         Why is my friendly coroner, after a 
                         long day at work, calling me at home?

                                     VOICE
                         I have something you'll want to see.

                         I doubt it.

                         No, you'll definitely want to see 
                         this.

               INT. MORGUE

               On the floor is the smoldering, blackened outline of a body. 
               A thick, slimy goo gurgles and pops. The whole room is afoul 
               with acrid smoke.

                                     CORONER

               Thomas jams his hands in his pockets and leans against an 
               autopsy table. Watches the smoke curl slowly up from the

               Gabriel crouches on the linoleum and pours everything out of 
               the evidence box onto the floor. He sifts through it, a smile 
               appearing when comes across the Chimney Rock Republican and 
               its circled obituary.

               Thomas sits hunched over his notes from the first day of the

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               On an utterly lonely blacktop, Gabriel shoots by in his top-
               down rambler, insignificant in the night's vastness. Jerry's 
               in the back, feet up on the seat.

                                     JERRY
                         Why do you need me? I can hardly 
                         walk now.

                         Some things are human work, son. 
                         Live or dead, human work. Besides, I 
                         like you.

                         Lucky moi.

               Gabriel suddenly stands on the brakes, SCREECHING the rambler 
               to a dusty stop. He kills the engine and everything is 
               instantly whispering night and coyote howls. Gabriel climbs 
               out and walks to the edge of a cliff. Far below, nestled 
               among the finger-like spires of volcanic cones, lies The 
               Town. Twinkling lights in a cold, dark embrace.

               Gabriel pushes his sunglasses up his nose and smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I can always smell a graveyard.

               Two coyotes begin fighting and snarling with each other in 
               the dust nearby.

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               On a low hill at the edge of town. Cracked, sinking 
               headstones. The rambler's parked next to a new one, Slim 
               Pickens on the AM, as Jerry digs up the fresh grave marked 
               General Arnold Hawthorne. Gabriel sits perched on the 
               headstone over the grave like a winged creature.

                                     JERRY
                         I hope you're enjoying this.

                         kill yourself.

                                     JERRY
                         But I did it, didn't I? I did kill 
                         myself.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Well, yes. Technically.

                                     JERRY
                         And you're just keeping me alive.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Letting you die slower.

                                     JERRY
                         I'm so in your debt.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Thank you, Jerry. I'm touched. Really.

               Jerry's shovel CLANKS onto something hard. He scrapes away 
               the dirt, revealing a coffin lid. With a socket wrench Jerry 
               removes the fastening bolts, then with the edge of his shovel, 
               pries open the lid.

               It's the ancient, wasted general we saw at the beginning. 
               His medals flash in the moonlight.

                                     JERRY
                         Not much to look at.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Ah, but it's not what's on the outside 
                         that matters --

               Gabriel leaps off his perch down into the grave.

                                     GABRIEL
                         -- It's what's on the inside.

               Gabriel reaches down, places one hand on the General's 
               forehead, one on his chin, and BREAKS the mouth open. He 
               gazes down into it. Then suddenly stiffens and straightens 
               up.

                                     GABRIEL

               Gabriel BANGS the coffin lid in frustration. Tries to think.

               the dresser.

                                     DAGGETT
                         It's my job, Jan. I go places 
                         sometimes.

                                     VOICE
                         I just had this terrible feeling 
                         about it. What's happening, Tom?

                                     DAGGETT
                         I don't know.

                                     VOICE
                         I miss you. Even when you're here. I 
                         miss you. I miss my brother. It's 
                         been four years, Tom, since...

                                     DAGGETT
                         I know.

                                     VOICE
                         We're the only blood family we have 
                         left, you and me. I worry about you.

                                     DAGGETT
                         I'll be okay.

                                     VOICE
                         Sorry about the dawn-attack call. I 
                         love you.

                                     DAGGETT
                         I love you too, Jan.

               He cradles the phone, stares at it, then picks up his 
               overnight bag.

               EXT. THE TOWN - NIGHT

               Silent and dead at this hour. Gabriel's boots creak on the 
               floorboards of the 19th century plank sidewalks. He taps his 
               finger aimlessly along plate glass shop windows.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Boy, what a dump, huh?

               Jerry, limping on a foot that's caving in on itself, wiping 
               the spinal fluid out of his dead eye, shuffles along behind.

               Gabriel pops off the elevated sidewalk, grabs a parking meter 
               and swings himself playfully around.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Why can't this shit ever go down in 
                         Miami? Or Bora Bora? I feel like 
                         I've spent my whole damn stay in gin 
                         swills like this.

                                     JERRY
                         Life's a bitch.

               Gabriel suddenly freezes. He sticks his nose up, sniffs like 
               a coyote, then abruptly drops to the ground in a push-up and 
               smells the dirt. Tastes it with his tongue. Smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Well well...

               INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT

               A fracture of broken moon tumbles through shattered windows 
               and falls dully across shapes old, shapes forgotten, and one 
               shape trying hopelessly to drag itself across the floor. 
               It's Simon; breath a rasp, blood-soaked pants leaving a long 
               smear behind him like a hemorrhaging snail. He coughs, drags 
               an arm across the lenses of his sunglasses,

               And looks up at a pair of black, lizard-skin boots.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hi, Simon.

               Simon rolls on his back and sighs.

                                     SIMON
                         Gabriel.

               Simon looks up at puss-faced Jerry, leaning quietly in a 
               dark corner.

                                     JERRY
                         Don't mind me. Just along for the 
                         ride.

               Gabriel sits down against the wall.

                                     GABRIEL
                         So, what shall we talk about? 
                         Theology?

                                     SIMON
                         I'm a little talked out on theology.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Fair enough...

               Gabriel turns his boot to the moon, watches the pale light 
               glint back off the lizard scales.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You know why I'm here.

                                     SIMON
                         Oh yes.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't happen to have it on you by 
                         chance?

                                     SIMON
                         No.

                                     GABRIEL
                         That would have been too easy.

               Simon suddenly JUMPS to his feet. Tries to escape. Jerry 
               trips him, SPRAWLING Simon back to the floor.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Please, Simon. Get serious.

               Gabriel walks over to him. Puts his face close.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Now. Where's the soul?
                              (beat)
                         You know. So high. Used to reside in 
                         the recently departed General 
                         Hawthorne.

               Simon doesn't answer. Gabriel shrugs.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Have it your way, big guy.

                                     SIMON
                         I do have one question.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Shoot.

                                     SIMON
                         Do you even remember what this war's 
                         about?

               Gabriel pauses, almost thoughtfully. Then he smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         That's hardly the point, is it?

                                     SIMON
                         I guess I never did get the point.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Happens.

                                     SIMON
                         How do you do it, Gabriel? How do 
                         you go on and on in this place?

                                     GABRIEL
                         I like it here, Simon. I always have.

                                     SIMON
                         I'm so tired...

               Gabriel grasps Simon's hand.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Then join us, Simon. Reject the Nicene 
                         Council. We were here first.

                                     SIMON
                         I can't do it, Gabriel. I don't even 
                         know why anymore, but I can't.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You know the routine.

                                     SIMON
                              (swallows hard)
                         Yes.

               Gabriel's hand is suddenly on Simon's face, fingers spread, 
               claw-like. They press into the flesh. Hard. And harder. Until 
               Simon starts to bleed.

               Then to burn.

               INT. KATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Katherine startles abruptly in her bed at the faraway sound 
               of Simon's screams. Screams carried either on the wind or 
               her dreams.

               INT. MARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Asleep, sweaty, shivering, Mary suddenly opens her eyes.

               INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING - NIGHT

               Gabriel releases his grip on Simon, letting him fall back 
               against the wall, afire. His clothes twist and blacken. His 
               skin creeps and pops. His sunglasses melt and fall away; 
               revealing two hollow pits beneath. Gabriel lifts Simon's 
               entire body up off the floor by just the disintegrating face, 
               and stares into the hollow pits.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Not yet.

               And the fires go out. Gabriel drops the crackling, acrid 
               body onto the floor. Impossibly, through the sizzling mucus 
               and molten hair, it breathes. It gasps in pain. It won't 
               die.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I can do this for five months, 
                         Simon...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE TOWN

               The skies above lighten and smear blue and red.

               KATHERINE

               Finishes dressing for school, picks up her teaching bag, and 
               crunches out across the gravel to her pick-up.

               INT. THE SCHOOL BUILDING

               Gabriel's lizard boots pace back and forth past Simon's 
               writhing, burning body. Gabriel's more jittery now. Losing 
               his patience. He bends down and pulls Simon's face up to 
               his.

                                     GABRIEL
                         This is getting boring, Simon.

                                     JERRY
                         Amen.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where is it? Where did you put it?

               The seared skin around Simon's mouth comes off in Gabriel's 
               hand. But Simon is still, even now, silent.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where is it!

               He flings Simon with a horrible crunch against the wall.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I'm just about out of tricks here. 
                         You're a tough one, friend. Old 
                         school.

               He walks over and places a hand with something like friendship 
               on Simon's charred shoulder.

                                     GABRIEL
                         God loves you, Simon.

               And with the other hand Gabriel JAMS his fist into Simon's 
               chest, PULLING OUT a lumpy, burned heart. Simon's mouth 
               springs open and hisses emptily. Gabriel slips the heart 
               into his pocket and lets go of Simon's shoulder. The body 
               instantly disintegrates and crashes to the floor.

               EXT. THE TOWN - MORNING

               Katherine squints at the morning glare as she drives through 
               town. Pulling into the school's drive she sees, parked at 
               the building's back door, a sheriff's patrol car.

               INT. SCHOOL BUILDING

               Katherine comes up the stairs of the building's abandoned 
               floor, passing the stacks of rotting desks toward where she 
               last saw Simon. There's a bad smell in the air.

               At a turn stands a deputy that looks up as Katherine 
               approaches.

                                     DEPUTY
                         You may want to skip this, ma'am.

               Katherine looks past him to where a second deputy crouches 
               down beside... beside something. It's human shaped, but like 
               a shadow. A shadow twisted in agony and slicked with a tarry, 
               smoldering ooze. The smell is overpowering. The crouched 
               deputy has a handkerchief over his mouth.

                                     CROUCHED DEPUTY
                         God damn...

                                     DEPUTY
                              (to Katherine)
                         Were any of your students up here?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Mary...

               EXT. MARY'S FAMILY TRAILER - DAY

               Katherine pulls-up and parks.

               INSIDE

               Mary is still in bed, droopy-eyed and sweating. Her 
               grandmother is there, and so is an elderly Navaho. He stands 
               beside Mary's side, holding above her body a clenched pouch 
               that he passes slowly back and forth.

                                     KATHERINE
                              (to grandmother)
                         How is she?

                                     GRANDMOTHER
                         Same.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Did the doctor come by?

                                     GRANDMOTHER
                         He found nothing. But something is 
                         in her. I know. Something the 
                         Belagaana doctor can't see. The night 
                         people have been around two days 
                         now. It is a warning.
                              (nods to Navaho man)
                         So we have called the hand trembler. 
                         To find if she must have an Enemy 
                         Ghost Way.

               The old man mumbles a soft chant as he moves the pouch back 
               and forth across Mary's body.

               EXT. MARY'S FAMILY TRAILER - DAY

               Katherine walks back out toward her pickup. She stops. Thirty 
               yards away, almost invisible in the sage say for the glare 
               of its evil, intelligent eyes, is a coyote. As she feels 
               it's gaze a shadow suddenly crosses her shoulder. Katherine 
               turns quickly but only barely catches, out of the corner of 
               her eye, a glimpse of something very large.

               And winged.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A huge semi ROARING deafeningly past on an empty desert 
               highway, KICKING UP a dusty cyclone that drifts over a one-
               horse gas station and Thomas, sitting there in his car 
               checking a map.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COUNTY BUILDING - DAY

               Small townish; old adobe and stucco walls, cannon on the 
               front lawn, every door loudly declaring itself a department: 
               SOCIAL SERVICES, COURTS, and, SHERIFF.

               INSIDE

               The Sheriff's personal office is turn of the century regal, 
               with high beam ceilings and rotating fans. Nothing seems 
               newer than 1940, including the coffee pot the Sheriff pours 
               a mugful from. Trim with glasses, bolo tie and boots, he 
               looks like Barry Goldwater.

                                     SHERIFF
                         And to what do I owe the thrill of a 
                         visit from a So Cal homicide cop?

               He hands the coffee to Thomas, sitting in a chair beside his 
               solid oak desk.

                         A middle-aged secretary enters with 
                         a stack of paper.

               She hands them to the Sheriff, who passes them on to Thomas. 
               He flips through the stack, comes up with nothing. The 
               secretary hands another, single sheet to the Sheriff.

                         Teacher complained some vagrant was 
                         sleeping in her schoolhouse.

               The Sheriff's brow crinkles in consternation as he reads 
               further.

                                     SHERIFF

               The Sheriff hands it to him. Glancing at it we pick up words 
               like BURNED, BLACK SLICK, BODY OUTLINE. Thomas copies the 
               name of the school down, gulps his coffee, and shakes the

               Thomas's sedan passing through the vast, empty land.

               FAR ON THE HORIZON

               A small clump of buildings emerge clinging hopelessly to the 
               earth. The Town.

               EXT. TOWN HOTEL - DAY

               A former miner's hotel, stone walls and sagging wrought iron.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM

               Thomas tosses his bag onto the bed, opens the balcony door, 
               and looks out on the crumbly shale hills, the abandoned 
               prospecting shacks, and the Chuska Mountains, clouds brewing 
               darkly across its shattered back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A close-up of the circled newspaper obituary for General 
               Hawthorne. The paper lowers and reveals behind it the 
               general's grave. The dirt around the tomb is loose, recently 
               filled. The grave keeper, a young, gangly, drifter type stands 
               nearby with his shovel.

               INT. THE SCHOOLHOUSE

               Thomas's breath escapes in warm clouds here in the unheated, 
               abandoned part of the building. Rats scurry away from feeding 
               on the dark, human-like stain on the floor as Thomas crouches 
               down beside it. He probes the dried, black, crusty flotsam 
               with his ball-point pen. Just like the burned body back at 
               the morgue.

               Far away you can hear the sounds of children. Of a teacher's 
               voice.

               DOWNSTAIRS

               It's only past the final door, into the smallest corner of 
               the building, that the walls become clean and brightly painted 
               by eager third graders. The creepy silence transforms itself 
               into the giggles of children as they bang open the classroom 
               door and whoop themselves outside for recess.

               The last one out is Katherine. She's surprised to see Thomas.

               Arms full, she pushes the building door open with her shoulder

               the kids.

                         There are no secrets in small towns, 
                         Mr. Dagget, dark or otherwise.

               ACROSS THE STREET

               Up the crumbly embankment, sitting perched on the roof of an 
               abandoned house, is Gabriel. He watches Thomas walk to his 
               car. He watches the children playing, lifting his nose to 
               snort the air, like a coyote.

               INT. THE TOWN LIBRARY

               Thomas sifts through some clippings on General Hawthrone. 
               Tactical genius. The man who saved Korea. Brutal. Almost 
               court marshalled a dozen times for his inspired savagery. A 
               truly ruthless man -- who spent the last twenty years quietly 
               tending his garden in a dying town.

               INT. THE TOWN CHURCH

               Small, simple, and woodplanked. The church we saw at the 
               beginning. Thomas sits there, staring at the candles, the 
               altar, the crucifix.

               He's alone there. But for a creeping buzz. A feeling in the 
               air.

                                     GABRIEL'S VOICE
                         It's unusual to see someone of your 
                         age in church on a weekday.

               Thomas turns in surprise. Gabriel is kneeling in the row 
               behind, inches from his ear.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't get me wrong. I think it's an 
                         excellent sign of character.

               There's something cold and creepy about Gabriel. Out of place 
               in here. There's another sound. Teeth chattering far in the 
               back. Thomas turns and sees Jerry, deep in the shadows of 
               the choir box. Jerry waves.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Never mind him. He shouldn't even be 
                         in here. Least not standing.

               Those sunglasses. Impenetrably dark. Like at the skid row 
               flophouse.

               And he walks out, leaving Thomas alone in a place gone 
               suddenly cold.

               INT. THOMAS'S HOTEL

               There's a note waiting for him at the front desk: "Her name 
               is Mary Tsosie. You can talk to her at noon tomorrow. I'll

               packed with elderly faces and find Katherine and John the 
               Navaho bus driver. Katherine waves him over. Both her and

               several cards.

               on a beer. When John releases her for another partner she 
               points at Thomas.

               EXT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

               Couples drift off the building's porch and into the street 
               to cool off, smoke, and take a few hits off paper bags. John 
               leans against the brick wall, tugs liberally from his paper 
               bag, and exchanges war hoops with some friends across the 
               street. He passes the bag to Katherine and Thomas.

               Thomas sits in the truck's bed as they Katherine drives 
               through town. John, on the near side of royally toasted, has 
               his boot stuck out the passenger window. Thomas looks up at 
               the night sky. At its blaze of stars.

                         The Bitter Sky Clan. Hard core 
                         reservation. No lights, no running 
                         water, no HBO. Their village is out 
                         on the edge of Old Woman Butte. 
                         Million miles from anything. Witch 
                         country. Settled right there in the 
                         Dead People Land where no one else 
                         would, right on top of the old Anasazi 
                         village. They're a dying clan. Just 
                         the old ones now. All alone out there 
                         in the middle of nothing.
                              (drinks)
                         They can keep it.

                         Do people really still believe in it 
                         all? Ghosts, Sings, corpse sickness?

                                     JOHN
                         Depends, I guess. Sometimes you go 
                         along because it's a village thing, 
                         or you don't want to disappoint 
                         grandma. But sometimes, when you're 
                         alone out there, far from town, and 
                         the wind kicks up and sneaks into 
                         your hogan... I don't know.

               John closes his eyes and drifts off. Thomas wanders into the 
               kitchen.

                         I think John's out for the evening.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Saturday night in Chimney Rock.

               She hands him a mug of coffee.

                                     DAGGETT
                         So how does a person like you end up 
                         teaching here?

                                     KATHERINE
                         When I was younger I used to believe 
                         that no matter how much you mucked 
                         around in your life, one day, if you 
                         listened hard enough, a voice would 
                         tell you what you were really cut 
                         out to do. And when it didn't show 
                         up on schedule I decided to go look 
                         for it. And I looked in a lot of 
                         places, believe me. I drove that 
                         road out there so far that the end 
                         became the beginning again. And it 
                         was when I got here that I realized 
                         there never was going to be a voice. 
                         So I stopped looking and took the 
                         first job they offered me. That make 
                         any sense to you?

                                     DAGGETT
                         Oh, I know all about voices. Problem 
                         is not all of them are very nice.

                                     KATHERINE
                         How did you end up a cop?

                                     DAGGETT
                         It was the evil of two lessers.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Are you always this cryptic?

                                     DAGGETT
                         No. When you get to know me I can be 
                         down right evasive.

               EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

               Katherine pulls up to drop Thomas off.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Thanks for the lift. Tomorrow at 
                         noon? At the little girl's house?

                                     KATHERINE
                         First trailer on the highway past 
                         town.

               Thomas climbs out.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I must say, Mr. Dagget, that you 
                         don't seem very like a police officer 
                         to me.

                                     DAGGETT
                         That's what my bosses keep saying.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I meant it as a compliment.

                                     DAGGETT
                         So taken. Goodnight, Miss Henley.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Goodnight, Tom-from-Los-Angeles.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Thomas lying in his hotel bed, flinching through a dream-
               filled sleep.

               There's glimpses of shattered images: War. Death. And a small, 
               dark-haired girl. Thomas's eyes open and fix on the ceiling.

               Out his window, perched on the railing of his balcony, is 
               something dark and winged.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The honey warmth of dawn heats the bluish, quiet streets of 
               The Town. Across shale hills and abandoned 19th century 
               miner's shacks, there echoes the faint, clear notes of a 
               trumpet. The bluesy notes drift over narrow dead-end streets, 
               junked cars, and the abandoned copper mine out past the end 
               of town.

               INT. MINE

               Deep in the tunneled rock, past the rusting conveyor belts, 
               Gabriel sits in a small cave blowing Miles Davis on his 
               trumpet. There's just the blanket he sits on and a single 
               candle. Jerry comes around the corner.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Get any sleep?
                              (Jerry only stares)
                         -- Just kidding.

               EXT. THE SCHOOLHOUSE - MORNING

               As Katherine climbs out of her pick-up she sees several of 
               her students standing in a circle. Crouched in the center, 
               talking to them, is a man. Gabriel. Jerry stands nearby.

               Gabriel is showing a boy his trumpet. Demonstrating where to 
               put his fingers.

                                     GABRIEL
                         ...There, and there. Now pucker your 
                         lips... aim it that way, and just 
                         blow a little bit, this is a special 
                         trumpet.

               The boy puffs lightly. The trumpet emits a piercing, clear 
               note that SHATTERS a window high up in the abandoned part of 
               the building. The youngsters whoop and applaud.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Very good, Timmy. Very good. Here, 
                         have a Junior Mint on me. Open up.

               As Timmy opens his mouth we clearly see Gabriel looking down 
               into it. Looking for something...

                                     GABRIEL
                         Who's next?

               Katherine approaches the scene warily. The children all beg 
               for their turn. Gabriel selects Sandra, one of Mary's second 
               grade friends, and puts her on his knee.

                                     GABRIEL
                         And who are you?

                                     SANDRA
                         Sandra.

               She can barely get her fingers around the trumpet.

                                     GABRIEL
                         And did you see the man upstairs, 
                         Sandra?

                                     SANDRA
                         A little.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Did you talk to him?

                                     SANDRA
                         No.

                                     GABRIEL
                         And who did, Sandra. Who talked to 
                         the man?

                                     SANDRA
                         Mary.

                                     GABRIEL
                         And where is Mary, Sandra?

                                     SANDRA
                         She isn't here. She's sick.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You've got very pretty teeth, Sandra. 
                         Here, let me see...

               He gently pushes down her chin with his thumb, opens her 
               mouth, and gazes in.

               Katherine enters the circle.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?

               Gabriel looks up, unperturbed, and smiles.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Just talking to the kids, Ma'am.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Get off his knee, Sandra. Everyone 
                         else, go inside. Now.

               The kids reluctantly shuffle off.

                                     BRIAN
                         'Bye, Gabriel.

                                     GABRIEL
                         See ya, kids. Be sure to study your 
                         math.

               He has the same sunglasses as Simon. The same cold, creepy 
               air about him.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Who are you?

                                     GABRIEL
                         It's a long story.

               Jerry suddenly snorts loudly, trying to retrieve a sticky 
               red glop that starts running out of his nose.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Ignore him.

                                     JERRY
                         Everyone else does.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I don't know what the hell is going 
                         on, but you both better get out of 
                         here. Right now.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're right...

               He climbs to his feet and stands close to her.

                                     GABRIEL
                         ...You have no idea what's going on.

               He stands there a beat. That terrible coldness that swirls 
               about him. The shriek of ghosts under his breath. Then he 
               climbs into the rambler with Jerry and pulls away. Katherine 
               watches the car drive off, then yells over to the school 
               janitor.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Al! Keep an eye on the children for 
                         me. I'll be right back. And call the 
                         sheriff.

                                     JANITOR
                         Sheriff? What the hell do I tell 
                         him?

                                     KATHERINE
                         Just call.

               Katherine gets into her pickup and starts the engine.

               EXT. THE TOWN - DAY

               Katherine drives through the main drag and out past the fringe 
               of town. As she passes the old copper mine she sees, parked 
               near the mine's tunnel entrance, Gabriel's rambler.

               EXT MARY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER - DAY

               As Katherine pulls up, she's surprised to see Thomas climbing 
               out of his own car.

                                     KATHERINE
                         You weren't suppose to be here till 
                         noon.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I wanted to check on her.

                                     DAGGETT
                         That makes two of us.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               On the sandy lot that extends back from the trailer is a 
               wizened cottonwood tree. Katherine, Thomas, and Mary are 
               seated beneath its shade. Katherine is protective of the 
               little girl, running a hand maternally through her hair.

                                     KATHERINE
                         How are you feeling, pumpkin?

                                     MARY
                         Better.

                                     KATHERINE
                         This is Mr. Dagget, Mary. He'd like

                         ...But sometimes it hurts.

               Thomas and Katherine exchange looks. Mary's pretty eyes rise 
               again as she calmly asks, in that cute little eight year old 
               voice:

                         and I do. Or maybe it was just the 
                         cold...

               Thomas looks to Katherine for an explanation, but she's as 
               confused as him.

                                     MARY
                         I've killed them, you know. Lots. 
                         You could always tell when they were 
                         coming. There'd be the trumpets first. 
                         Every note flat. Then those songs... 
                         After that they'd charge. Right down 
                         through the snow. The guns would 
                         freeze and it would be just knives... 
                         It was so cold and there were so 
                         many of them. But I was smarter than 
                         they were. Even at Chosin, I was 
                         smarter...

               Mary's been explaining this in a girlish, show-'n-tell kind 
               of way. Suddenly her face cracks as her voice chokes with a 
               sob.

                                     MARY
                         It scares me, Miss Henley. I hate 
                         it. Please, make it stop!

               She buries herself into Katherine's arms, sobbing.

                                     MARY

               Mary suddenly pushes away and runs back toward the trailer, 
               into the arms of her grandmother.

                                     KATHERINE

               rambler's tracks and several footprints leading into the 
               mine.

               Thomas steps up to the edge of the tunnel. It's a black, 
               yawning thing that swallows the sunlight whole for breakfast.

               The sun very quickly becomes a memory. And after the first 
               bend it isn't even that anymore. There's only the glow of 
               the flashlight; glancing off the abrupt edges of tunneled 
               rock. Here and there are the flotsam of a bankrupt industry; 
               dented ore carts lying on their side, rusted drill bits, 
               piles of support timbers. And all around them the sucking

               They walk further down into the mine. The atmosphere becomes 
               close and creepy. Thomas has been following tracks left in 
               the dusty floor that abruptly disappear. He stops and sighs.

               screams and spins around, loosing her footing and half falling 
               into a yawning ore chute she hadn't seen beside her. Thomas 
               rushes over and pulls her out. She climbs shakily to her 
               feet.

               Thomas takes a last pass at the mine shaft with his 
               flashlight.

               He bangs it once against his thigh before he notices for the 
               first time a dim, amber light coming from a space between 
               the rocks.

               But his gun's out at his side. Just in case. They follow the 
               light to the gap in the rock, gingerly stepping into

               A CAVERN

               -- That could easily belong to a bum. It's Gabriel and Jerry's 
               digs. Just the moldy blanket, single oil lamp, piles of 
               twinkie wrappers,

               And something else.

               From outside the cave it's the same whine, the same blurryness 
               that drips off Gabriel like sweat. But once they step into 
               the room, into the lair, it suddenly jumps in volume. This 
               is where Gabriel sleeps, and it's thicker here, like honey 
               on the walls. Thomas has difficulty focusing his eyes.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Do you feel it?

               But Thomas can't hear Katherine anymore, her voice has 
               disappeared beneath the whine. As it becomes too much he 
               leans his weight against the rock wall and shuts his eyes.

               It's then they come. Flashes of images: Of screams and fire. 
               Of impossible vistas of emptiness and death. And shrieking 
               overhead, shrieking everywhere; grotesque, winged creatures 
               with no eyes. Some with faces we know; Gabriel, Simon, and 
               the gargoyle. All these images are being jammed into both 
               their minds by the cave.

               Thomas forces his eyes open but the scenes playing all around 
               him won't go away. Tears are running down Katherine's face 
               as she stands there locked in the same images. Thomas stumbles 
               about the room as if drunk, the visions, incomprehendibly 
               black visions of war and destruction on an alien plateau, 
               eat his brain. He sinks to his knees and begins to cry.

                         Oh no... Oh God no...

               Katherine's curled up on the floor like a child, weeping. 
               The images are driving them mad. Thomas, fighting the insanity 
               pounding at him, crawls pathetically across the floor to the 
               oil lamp. His fingers grasp it spasmotically as he rises to 
               his knees and leans back.

               He HEAVES the lamp against the cave wall, where it EXPLODES, 
               the oil erupting into a swirling blaze that CONSUMES the 
               corner.

               The images break a second in the heat and light and sucking 
               wind. Just long enough for Thomas to grab Katherine's arm 
               and pull her out of the room.

               EXT. MINE - DAY

               Katherine and Thomas lie in the dust outside the mine's tunnel 
               entrance. Catching their breath. Trying to organize and repair 
               the short circuits in their brains. Thomas rolls on his side, 
               squints at the sun. Katherine's voice is faint and raspy.

                                     KATHERINE

                         How? I don't even believe in heaven.

               The tears start rolling down her face. She looks up and shouts 
               at the endless sky above them.

                                     KATHERINE

               INT. MARY'S GRANDMOTHER'S TRAILER

               Katherine and Thomas open the trailer door and enter 
               cautiously.

                         Mary?

               Thomas looks out the window and notices for the first time, 
               parked behind the trailer, Gabriel's rambler. He immediately 
               pulls out his pistol, runs for the closed door at the end of 
               the hall and KICKS it in. The door FLIES open, revealing 
               Gabriel sitting on the bed beside Mary.

                         profanity.

               Jerry suddenly LEAPS out from behind the door and TACKLES 
               Thomas to the carpet. The gun skitters to one side as Jerry 
               SINKS his rotting teeth into Thomas's shoulder. Thomas cries 
               out and SLAMS his fist against Jerry's head, knocking off an 
               ear.

               Gabriel turns back to Mary's frightened face and smiles as 
               he runs a hand through her hair.

                         It'll only be a moment...

               Katherine suddenly HAMMERS Gabriel across the side of the 
               head with a chair, KNOCKING him to the floor. As he gets up 
               she HITS him again.

               Thomas manages to bring his leg up and KICKS Jerry hard 
               against the chest, forcing him off.

               Gabriel GRABS both of Katherine's legs and PULLS, CRASHING 
               her flat on her back.

               Thomas scrambles for his gun, grabs it, and as Jerry comes 
               at him again spins and FIRES twice. The slugs RIP into Jerry's 
               chest and knock him to his knees. As the putrid, curdled 
               juices pump lumpily out of him, Jerry looks up at Thomas and 
               smiles.

                                     JERRY
                         Thanks man, I appreciate it. You're 
                         a sport.

               Thomas FIRES a slug into his forehead. Jerry's brain winks 
               out as he collapses to the floor, dead.

               Thomas's gun is abruptly WRENCHED from his hand onto the bed 
               as Gabriel NAILS him with a thrown lamp, vaults the bed 
               between them, and grabs him by the collar, SLAMMING Thomas 
               up against the wall. He looks down at Jerry's finally lifeless 
               corpse, incensed at Thomas's handiwork.

                                     GABRIEL

                         idea how hard it is to get one of 
                         those?

               He THROWS Thomas down onto a table, SPLINTERING it. Katherine 
               climbs shakily to her knees.

                                     KATHERINE

               Gabriel walks over to the bed. The moment he gets close, 
               Mary lifts Thomas's pistol up from the sheets and SHOOTS him 
               twice, the impact KNOCKING him on his ass.

               Katherine rushes to Mary, scoops her up and runs for the 
               door. She pauses beside Thomas, still lying in the wreckage 
               of the table.

               Katherine disappears through the bedroom doorway.

               Gabriel spins around and stands. Thomas leaps from a ragged 
               crouch, HITTING Gabriel low with a body-block.

               It's like butting concrete.

               Gabriel picks up Thomas by the scruff of the neck and HEAVES 
               him THROUGH the flimsy room paneling. Thomas CRASHES with a 
               mass of splinters into the kitchen. He stumbles backward 
               hopelessly as Gabriel peruses him through the trailer. He 
               desperately throws pots, glasses, anything at Gabriel. Finally 
               trapped, he scrambles up onto the dinner table, SCATTERING 
               salt and sugar bowls, and DIVES through the levored window.

               OUTSIDE

               Thomas, in a hail of shattered glass, smacks the red earth, 
               pulls himself up to his knees and tries to stumble and crawl 
               away as Gabriel BANGS open the trailer door and stomps down 
               the stairs toward Katherine, her arms around Mary.

                                     KATHERINE

               He eases his gait, measuring the distance to her.

                         ...Have Her!!

               Katherine lifts Thomas's pistol and FIRES. Again. Again. The 
               slugs BANG off the corregated metal, SMASH a window, KICK up 
               some dust,

               And PUNCTURE the propane tank beneath the trailer.

               -- WUMPP-BAM!

               The entire trailer EXPLODES in a fiery cloud of TWISTING 
               METAL.

               Katherine huddles Mary close to the ground as flaming chunks 
               WHACK everywhere.

               Gabriel is HAMMERED to the earth and disappears in the rolling 
               fire cloud. Thomas, further away, is KNOCKED head-over-heels 
               in the ruddy dust.

               The fire cloud dissipates quickly into the sky, leaving behind 
               scorched brush, and little else, crackling softly. Gabriel's 
               body looks blackened and still. Katherine rushes to Thomas, 
               who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above 
               his eye bleeding badly. She helps him to his feet and over 
               to the pickup, where he sits down against the tire as 
               Katherine pulls out her first aid kit. Mary's there, standing 
               with her shaken grandmother.

                         got to cut their hearts out. The 
                         only thing God gave them.

               A sheriff car ROARS up, the two deputies exiting warily.

                                     DEPUTY
                         What the hell happened here?

               Katherine's wiping the blood out of Thomas's eye. Gasping 
               from the shearing pain, he tosses an ID at the foot of the 
               deputy.

                         That's a start. How about the rest 
                         of it?

               From somewhere back in town there's the growl of a volunteer 
               fire engine.

                              (grimaces)
                         -- Shit...

               The pain's unbareable. Katherine dabs his cut with 
               disinfectant.

                                     DEPUTY
                         I think you're going to the hospital

               The volunteer fire engine growls up through the weeds, 
               drowning out Thomas's words. Two firemen kneel down beside 
               him with medical kits.

               The deputy has walked over to his partner and the two are 
               dragging back between them a cuffed, comatose Gabriel.

                         You'll never hold him.

               Thomas tries to get up, but the pain and a hand from the 
               firemen keep him down. As the deputies pass, he manages to 
               desperately grab the one's pant cuff.

                         sunglasses...

               Gabriel's head lies low between the shoulders. The deputy 
               looks with concern at the firemen.

                                     FIREMAN
                              (re Thomas)
                         He'll be all right. Just a bad hit.

               The deputy nods. As they carry on to the car with Gabriel, 
               the angel turns his head slightly and smiles a smile only 
               for Thomas.

                                     FIREMAN
                              (to partner)
                         Let's get a splint.

               The patrol car pulls away. As the firemen walk back to their 
               engine, Thomas looks frantically at Katherine.

                         have to do it now.

               They lock eyes. Then Katherine without a word helps Thomas 
               up into the passenger side of the pickup. Mary gathers her 
               grandmother into the pickup's bed and climbs up beside her 
               as Katherine starts the engine. The firemen turn in confusion 
               as the truck peels out of the lot and up onto the road.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               Katherine's truck shoots by. Just before town, near the copper 
               mine, it slows down at a junction.

               And there, lying on its side down the embankment, is the 
               sheriff's patrol car. A single, bent tire turns aimlessly.

               Katherine hits the gas and takes the junction that leads 
               away from town, out onto the endless expanse of the plateau.

               INT. TRUCK

               The bandage on Thomas's forehead covers most of one eye. He 
               closes the other tightly, riding a spasm of pain, before 
               letting his forehead rest against the door glass and gazing 
               out at the empty tracks of land.

               Katherine looks over her shoulder to Mary's grandmother 
               sitting in the truck bed. She nods in understanding.

               A trading post with a few pumps, growing orange in the 
               weakening afternoon light. A scruffy dog barks constantly as 
               the teenage Indian sticks the nozzle in Katherine's pickup. 
               Still glassy-eyed with throbbing pain, Thomas takes another 
               handful of aspirin and climbs out of the cab.

               There's a tiny, weatherbeaten church across the weedy lot 
               from the trading post with a pay phone bolted to it. Thomas 
               crunches across the lot, picks up the receiver, and punches 
               in some numbers.

               And Thomas hangs up. He backs away from the phone and for 
               the first time notices the church it's attached to.

               INT. CHURCH

               Thomas steps inside. It's empty and there's some doubt whether 
               it's been used in a generation. The pews are dusty and 
               scraped, some broken down completely. Thomas sits in one and 
               looks across the space and dust and years to the crucifix 
               hanging behind the altar.

                         even control your own killers anymore?

               Thomas holds his face in his hands a silent moment. When it 
               raises we see the raw hurt in the eyes as he shouts,

               Standing in the back, watching Thomas with tears welling in 
               her eyes, is Katherine.

               turns off the small dirt road onto an even smaller one that 
               winds impossibly up the side of a volcanic butte.

               Higher and higher the truck climbs on the rutted and 
               treacherous path, till at last it crests the ridge and comes

               THE VILLAGE

               Perched frighteningly on the leading edge of Old Woman Butte, 
               this is the home of the Bitter Sky Clan. The village is a 
               small grouping of ancient adobe walled hogans first built a 
               thousand years ago by the Anasazi. There's no electricity 
               here, no TV antennas or frozen yogurt. Just the slow curl of 
               cooking fires drifting up through smoke holes and the stern, 
               deeply lined face of an old Navaho man approaching the pickup 
               as Katherine stops.

               The old man wears jeans, a bright maroon silk shirt, and a 
               black felt reservation hat with a turkey feather. He holds 
               in his right hand a small leather case.

                                     OLD MAN

               The old man, Bartholomew Grey Horse, walks up to Mary and 
               her grandmother sitting in the bed.

               Several villagers approach and greet Mary and her grandmother, 
               some nodding politely to Thomas and Katherine as they climb 
               out of the cab. Nearly all of them are elderly.

               Thomas, one eye still half-shut by a bandage, walks over to 
               the village's edge where a short stone wall, and little else, 
               separates the adobe homes from the long, 2000 foot drop to 
               the desert floor. He leans against it and gazes out on a 
               view that must encompass half the world. In all directions, 
               for tens upon tens of miles, there are only volcanic spires 
               and crumbling buttes, all reduced from up here to short, 
               ominous playthings. A village truly alone in the world.

               She's appeared beside him. Thomas crouches down to her level 
               and smiles.

                         hold off an entire battalion for 
                         weeks. Months.

               Thomas's voice sighs sadly as he runs a hand softly through 
               her hair.

               Mary's eyes fill with tears as her grandmother appears and 
               leads her back to the adobe hogans.

               Grey Horse, the yataalii, is there now.

                         after dark, we begin again.

               INSIDE THE KIVA

               The fire has died to embers, casting its weak glow on a now 
               empty room.

               OUTSIDE

               Katherine wanders along the edge of the village, turning up 
               her collar under a blinding mass of stars. There's nothing 
               beyond the village. Not a light, not a sound. Say the wind. 
               It is the icy brush of wind on her body that now whispers.

                                     VOICE
                         Hello, Katherine.

               Like the wind, it is low and thin and hoarse. Like the wind 
               it seems to come from everywhere. And, like the wind, it is 
               utterly without pity or remorse.

               Katherine turns.

               Perched on the wall behind her in a low crouch is a figure 
               clad entirely in layers of black. Its head and hands are 
               hairless and waxy white. There are eyes in this winged head, 
               but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow. There are endless 
               scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are 
               the eyes.

               Katherine gulps down, with only partial success, the hysteria 
               rising in her throat.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Oh Lord, I can't do this. I can't do 
                         this anymore...

                                     FIGURE
                         We must talk, Katherine.

               It's takes all her strength to look upon him.

                                     KATHERINE
                         You're... You're...
                              (tries to form the 
                              word)
                         ...God?

                                     FIGURE
                         God is love, Katherine.

               The eyes narrow. Rippling pools of unfathomable evil.

                                     FIGURE
                         -- I don't love you.

               There's a crouched silhouette beside the figure. Dimmer. 
               Skinny. A wheezing sycophant. An afterthought.

               Katherine backs away from both of them.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I can't. I can't do this tonight. Go 
                         away.

                                     FIGURE
                         I can kill you, Katherine. I can lay 
                         you out and fill your mouth with 
                         your mother's feces. Or I can talk 
                         with you.

               Katherine stops. Faces him.

                                     FIGURE
                         I am here, before you, in a form to 
                         put you at ease.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Good job.

               The sycophant shivers and ruffles something feathery under 
               its cloak.

                                     FIGURE
                         I rarely do this in person. I am, 
                         perhaps, somewhat out of touch.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Are you one of them?

                                     FIGURE
                         No.

                                     KATHERINE
                         You're not an angel?

                                     FIGURE
                         Oh, I am an angel. A very special 
                         one. The first. The oldest. The naive 
                         eagle scout, he once loved me above 
                         all others, and I him. It was the 
                         only true love for either of us, but 
                         like all true love, it couldn't 
                         possibly last.

               The figure cranes his neck around to the horizon beyond them. 
               The movement makes a liquid, snapping sound.

                                     FIGURE
                         The winged party boys will come, 
                         Katherine. They'll come to feed on 
                         the guts of your little Mary.

                                     KATHERINE
                         What do you care?

                                     FIGURE
                         I have my interests...

               He turns back to her.

                                     FIGURE
                         The naive eagle scout, he has his 
                         interests too. He even has a place 
                         for them, as I do for mine. Big, 
                         shiny place. You'd like it. Only 
                         it's been empty for a long time. 
                         Can't open till after the 
                         resurrection. The problem's with the 
                         hired help. Always had problems with 
                         the hired help. They're arrogant, 
                         boastful little pricks. Not like me. 
                         What I did I did for love. But they, 
                         the winged party boys, even before 
                         the park could open for its first 
                         customer, they started fighting over 
                         the popcorn stand.

               The figure shifts his perch on the wall.

                                     FIGURE
                         You see, Katherine, heaven can't 
                         start accepting guests till this 
                         fight is settled. And without people, 
                         there is no heaven. All those good 
                         and true souls left mouldering in 
                         the ground clutching their H-tickets 
                         and waiting and waiting and waiting... 
                         Some, lying down there with the worms 
                         century after century, they start to 
                         get doubts about the whole program. 
                         That's when, out of sheer boredom, 
                         some of them come to me. Because I'm 
                         always open for business. 24 hours a 
                         day, seven days a week. Even on 
                         Christmas.

               The figure's face darkens.

                                     FIGURE
                         Some of the angels cheat. They sneak 
                         a few souls in to help with the fight. 
                         The really dark ones. And now one of 
                         them has found a special soul so 
                         wonderfully sick that it might just 
                         win it for them. And if one side 
                         wins, even the wrong one, then there's 
                         no fight. And if there's no fight, 
                         there can be a heaven.

                                     KATHERINE
                         And if there's a heaven?

                                     FIGURE
                         I'd be very unhappy.
                              (beat)
                         I am here to help you and the little 
                         bitch not because I love you, not 
                         because I care about you, but because 
                         I want this war to go on and on and 
                         on.

               The figure straightens up, stretching its spine.

                                     FIGURE
                         I bring you the chance to save your 
                         Mary, Katherine. And along the way, 
                         stop the resurrection.

                                     KATHERINE
                         How?

                                     FIGURE
                         Listen when I speak. Now go to bed, 
                         Katherine. Tomorrow, I promise you, 
                         is a big day.

               INT. HOGAN

               Thomas's sitting on the hard-packed floor, leaning against 
               the adobe wall, maybe trying to sleep. Mostly trying to ignore 
               the thumping pain in his head. The oil lamp's flame shudders 
               in the gust of Katherine opening the door.

                         Here, I'll change the bandage.

               She carefully unwraps the blood-soaked gauze.

                         Does that hurt?

                         it.

               A wind outside rustles through the hogans.

                                     DAGGETT
                         The other night, you were talking 
                         about waiting for a voice to call 
                         you to something. Well, let me tell 
                         you, the worst thing that can happen 
                         to you is to be called to something. 
                         Since I can remember a voice from 
                         somewhere deep in the Church called 
                         me. So loud and so often that by 
                         thirteen I knew I was going to be a 
                         priest. You know what that's like? 
                         My parents, friends, all of them 
                         thought I was crazy. But see, I had 
                         this voice. The voice that kept 
                         coaxing me along, telling me there 
                         was a reason. So I entered the 
                         seminary and was half way to my 
                         starched white collar when my mother, 
                         father, and my little brother were 
                         wiped out in a car crash.

               He pauses, the old emotions creeping back up on him.

                         I had never asked anything of the 
                         voice. Not when the neighborhood 
                         kids made fun of me, not when my 
                         father looked down at me like some 
                         knock-kneed faggot. I never questioned 
                         a damn thing. But on the morning I 
                         spent looking down at three parallel 
                         graves, I asked it one question. 
                         Why. Why were these people taken 
                         from me? And the voice, that same 
                         voice that would wrench me out of my 
                         sleep some nights with its jabbering, 
                         it was suddenly stone silent. It was 
                         the only question I ever asked of it 
                         and it just left me hanging in the 
                         fucking wind...

               He blinks back the tears welling in his eye.

                         So after that I traded in priest 
                         school for homicide school. Because 
                         if God wouldn't talk to me the devil 
                         sure as hell would, and his ways 
                         were a lot easier to understand.

                         Maybe we both were.

               The oil lamp wanes and fades. Katherine lays her head on 
               Thomas's shoulder, and as darkness swallows them he holds 
               her. They hold each other.

               John the bus driver lying fully dressed on his bed asleep. 
               The night breeze through the window, and maybe something 
               else, tickles his nose. His eyes open, blink, turn left, 
               right, then up,

               -- And see Gabriel perched on the headboard, staring down at 
               him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Heavy sleeper, John.

               John's eyes open wide in shock. Gabriel's skin is blackened 
               and blistered in parts. Whole shards of his shirt are missing. 
               John tries to sit up but Gabriel forces his head back down 
               with his palm. With the ease of a spider he slides down and 
               beside John.

                                     JOHN
                         Don't -- Don't hurt me, man. My 
                         wallet's in the dresser.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Don't be such a materialist, John.

                              bottle on dresser,

                         No end to your bad habits.

                                     JOHN
                         What do you want?

                                     GABRIEL
                         A moment of your time.

                                     JOHN
                         You ought to have that nose looked 
                         at, man.

               Gabriel leans said nose in very close and whispers,

                                     GABRIEL
                         Where are they, John? Katherine and 
                         Mary? Where would they go?

                                     JOHN
                         What? Mary? I don't know.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Sure you do. Think hard.

                                     JOHN
                         No, really. I don't know. The school 
                         maybe.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Now you're not even trying, John. 
                         You're Katherine's best friend. She 
                         tells you everything.

                                     JOHN
                         I'm just the driver, y'know?

               Gabriel extends a blistered, open palm over John's face.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I can help you remember, John...

               FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM

               We see Gabriel leaning over John as a sickly yellow glow 
               begins to rise and reflect off the walls. Beneath it comes 
               John's worst and deepest screams...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Gabriel SPLASHING the soot off his face and arms in a small, 
               institutional bathroom. He looks at himself in the mirror, 
               runs a hand through his hair, and walks out the door into

               A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

               At the end of it is the intensive care unit, that 
               institutional purgatory where a small handful of patients, 
               wired and tubed and oxygenated, lay inconclusively between 
               life and death. There's a nurse's station there, all health 
               status video screens and a single nurse that looks up from 
               her work at Gabriel.

                                     NURSE
                         Can I help you?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Someone's going to die here soon. 
                         I'll just be a minute.

                                     NURSE
                         There's no visitors allowed in ICU.

                                     GABRIEL
                         The timing's important. I can smell 
                         these things, you know.

               The nurse reaches for the telephone. Gabriel takes it away 
               from her with one hand and with the other grasps her face 
               open-palmed and whispers,

                                     GABRIEL
                         Go to sleep.

               The nurse slides out of her chair and collapses to the floor. 
               Gabriel pulls out the metal clipboards holding each patient's 
               chart and flips through them, tossing one after another aside 
               as unsuitable.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Recovering... Recovering... Stable...
                              (finally settles on 
                              one)
                         Deteriorating critical.

               Satisfied, he steps over to one of the beds, pulls back the 
               curtain and sits down beside an unconscious, middle-aged 
               woman. He watches patiently, listening the beeping scrawl of 
               the EKG above her.

               It was weak to begin with but now it's faltering badly, 
               becoming the unsynched etchings of a child. A beeping alarm 
               has begun to ring and her breathing is slowing to nothing. 
               At the last possible moment Gabriel places his fingers across 
               her face, whispering to her, coaxing her.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Whoa, not just yet. Come on back. 
                         That's it...

               The EKG's still flat but the woman is breathing. She begins 
               to choke, to cough, then suddenly sits up and opens her eyes. 
               She looks in disbelief around her, finally settling on 
               Gabriel's grin.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Hi.

               A look of utter desolation and sadness sweeps over her as 
               she begins to cry.

                                     WOMAN
                         No, no...

                         Promise.

               The sun cresting the Lukachukais and warming with honey 
               colored reflection the interior of the hogan.

               Katherine's head is still on Thomas's shoulder, the two of 
               them asleep sitting against the wall.

               Katherine opens her eyes and rises stiffly. She looks out 
               the simple window to the glow of morning without expression, 
               turns, and walks out.

               IN THE OTHER HOGAN

               Mary's Grandmother and some of the other elderly villagers 
               are attending Mary as Katherine enters. Mary is sitting up 
               in her bed. She smiles at Katherine.

                                     MARY

                         Hi, pumpkin. Good morning.

               Grey Horse is kneeling near the bed preparing a bowl drink. 
               Into it he crushes charcoal, dodge weed, juniper and ghost 
               plant. This he stirs, heats over flame, and feeds to Mary. 
               She grimaces and leans back in the bed as Grey Horse says a 
               brief prayer.

               OUTSIDE

               Katherine runs into Thomas outside the hogan.

                                     DAGGETT
                              (nods)
                         So we stay and dump the General's 
                         soul.

                                     KATHERINE
                         You have the gun?

                                     DAGGETT
                         With one shot left. The spares --
                              (sniffs his shirt)
                         -- And a change of clothing, are all 
                         still at the hotel.
                              (sighs)
                         We're going to have to come up with 
                         something.

                                     KATHERINE
                         We could always ask him.

               Thomas looks up. She's referring to Lucifer, who's appeared 
               perched on the edge of the low, eye-level hogan roof. The 
               sycophant is also nearby, chattering its teeth and staring 
               at Katherine with jealous, rabid eyes.

               Lucifer shivers, a claw turning up the collar of his cloak.

                                     LUCIFER
                         I always forget how cold it gets in 
                         the desert.

               The swimming, bottomless eyes fall on Thomas.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Mr. Daggett, I presume. How's the 
                         faith?

               Thomas can't bring himself to say anything. To form the words.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Come come, must you be so wishy-washy 
                         about everything? With the absent-
                         minded eagle scout, I can see that. 
                         But you're looking at the devil man, 
                         say something.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Fuck you.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Much better. Can I have some coffee?

               Thomas gingerly hands him the cup. The angel Lucifer lifts 
               it, and with something unimaginably awful darting out of his 
               mouth, drinks. He offers the mug back to Thomas for a sip.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Keep it.

               He finishes it. Cranes his neck.

                                     LUCIFER
                         I have come to remind you that the 
                         winged party boys are just that: 
                         spoiled boys. You are armed, however 
                         pathetically, with the one thing 
                         they never really understood: 
                         theology. It's not much, but that's 
                         life.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Is this supposed to be our "win one 
                         for The Ripper" speech?

                                     LUCIFER
                         Don't press your luck, Mr. Daggett.

               And you know instantly, in the bottom of your stomach, that 
               those eyes mean it.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Go and get ready, Thomas.

               Thomas hesitates, holds the gaze, then turns and leaves. In 
               an instant Lucifer sweeps down from the hogan roof to 
               Katherine's side. Face and eyes and maggot breath 
               uncomfortably close, he smiles.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Have you ever considered Katherine, 
                         that the great absentee landlord, 
                         the soft-eyed eagle scout your 
                         childhood prayers are for, is just 
                         using you? That you're only the 
                         exterminator to get rid of his pests?

               Lucifer places a cloaked arm around her shoulder and leads 
               her to the walled edge to look out across the endless plateau. 
               His mouth presses against her ear and whispers,

                                     LUCIFER
                         God's junkies are coming, Katherine. 
                         And when they do, all hell is going 
                         to break loose...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A tiny speck on the empty horizon. It grows, takes shape, 
               and finally becomes a red convertible rambler as it WOOSHES 
               past on a desolate throat of forgotten highway.

               Gabriel's at the wheel. Beside him, grey-blonde hair streaming 
               out behind her, is Rachael, recently lifted from the file-
               and-forget section of the hospital ICU. She tilts her head 
               up. Lets the sun warm her pallor. Just a sociopathic angel 
               and his somewhat deceased babe out for a top-down cruise 
               across a sixty million year old desert.

               It could happen.

               INT. ROADSIDE DINER - DAY

               A reality bruised waitress, Madge, sets down a coffee and 
               milkshake before Gabriel. He downs the shake in one belt.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Say, Ma'am, any idea where I can 
                         find Old Woman Butte?

                                     MADGE
                         It's on the reservation.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I don't suppose you could be just a 
                         tad more specific. Madge.

               The waitress' eyes move from the guy with sunglasses and 
               burn marks on his shirt to the woman sitting alone outside 
               in the rambler.

                                     MADGE
                         Isn't your friend hungry?

                                     GABRIEL
                         Not for a while, I'm afraid. Funniest 
                         thing.

               Madge has a lot of things she misses in her life, but one of 
               them she decides isn't Gabriel.

                                     MADGE
                         Take 522 to the Sonsela Wash cut-
                         off. First dirt road go left. Twenty, 
                         twenty-five miles you'll see it. 
                         Big, black and all alone.

               Gabriel downs the coffee, stands, and tosses a bill on the 
               counter.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I doubt we'll meet again.

                                     MADGE
                         Suits me.

               EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

               Thomas drags a heavy chain from Katherine's truck and begins 
               fastening it to a post. Lucifer watches perched on a nearby 
               rooftop.

                                     DAGGETT
                         You could always lend a hand.

               Lucifer just smiles or sneers or whatever he does with that 
               hideous mouth.

               INSIDE THE KIVA

               Grey Horse begins laying out his prayer instruments as Mary 
               is prepared with paint and oils.

               OUTSIDE

               Katherine leans against the doorway, nervously watching the 
               horizon.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The sky thinning into uneasy pastels as the sun falls 
               unceremoniously toward the mountains. A few lanterns have 
               been lit, and from inside the kiva can be heard the chants 
               of the Navaho Enemy Ghost Way.

               Katherine's eyes are still on a horizon dropping off into 
               shadow. She stiffens. There, at the end of the earth, appears 
               a silent plume of dust. It could be anybody's car, but it 
               can only be one car. Thomas steps up beside her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         He's coming.

               Thomas sticks his head into the kiva, speaks softly to one 
               of the elderly villagers attending the ceremony.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Is there any way to speed this up?

                                     VILLAGER
                         No.

               A fire has been built on the kiva's floor. Through the choking 
               smoke can be seen Mary lying on a mat as Grey Horse chants 
               to the yei spirits and adds fine colored earth to the growing 
               sand painting beside her. His voice rises and falls in 
               guttural syntax. He's coaxing. Coaxing the alien spirit out 
               of the child.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Lock the door.

               He pulls his head out and hands Katherine the pistol.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Stay inside. It's only one round, so 
                         make it count.

               There's a pause and for a moment their eyes lock. She touches 
               his arm, almost says something, then disappears into the 
               kiva. Thomas closes the door behind her. He turns and looks 
               out at the distant plume of dust. Growing closer.

               EXT. GABRIEL'S RAMBLER - DAY

               Radio turned up, sophomoric grin glued on his face, Gabriel 
               roars past and begins the snaking climb up the side of the 
               butte. The sun has almost completely slipped away now, leaving 
               the land a deathly bluish grey.

               The road flattens out at the top of the butte and Gabriel 
               can see the village glowing at the far end. He punches the 
               rambler, winding it up for the last stretch, and pats the 
               blonde on the knee.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You'll like this, Rachael.

               Maybe not.

               There's a sudden glint of metal in the headlights as Thomas 
               at the last moment PULLS UP the heavy chain and HOOKS it 
               over the far post. Gabriel does something pointless with the 
               brakes and SLAMS forward into it. The whole rear of the car 
               STANDS UP on impact, PITCHING Gabriel through the windshield 
               into the dust.

               Thomas steps out from behind the post armed with an iron 
               bar. The rambler hisses and belches a death rattle as he 
               cautiously walks toward the spot of gloom where Gabriel lies.

                                     GABRIEL
                              (breathless)
                         Nice move.

               Thomas's feet crunch softly closer.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You ought to come work for us. 
                         Upstairs. We sneak the odd civilian 
                         in now and then, you know. You'd 
                         like it. Nobody tells you when to go 
                         to bed, can eat all the ice cream 
                         you want. And you get to kill. All 
                         day and all night. Just like an angel.

               Thomas doesn't answer. Gabriel's body looks ravaged as he 
               carefully steps closer and closer.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Save yourself, friend. Why go to the 
                         wall with the bitch and her rug rat? 
                         It'll all turn out the same anyway. 
                         Here or in heaven, we're still gonna 
                         tear the kid apart.

                                     DAGGETT
                         I'm not an angel, heaven or hell. 
                         I'm a man you eyeless puke, which 
                         means I have one thing you never 
                         will. A soul. And though I may, 
                         somewhere inside, believe in a God, 
                         I will never, never, believe in you.

                                     GABRIEL
                         A little speechy today, aren't we?
                              (sighs)
                         Okay pal, have it your way.

               Gabriel's legs suddenly SWING AROUND and SMACK Thomas, 
               sprawling him back into the dirt. The iron bar goes flying 
               as Gabriel in a flash is on top of him. Thomas thrashes but 
               Gabriel easily pins his shoulders and sits on his chest. 
               Without hurry he uncurls the fingers of his right hand.

                                     GABRIEL
                         This is going to really, really hurt.

               Thomas's eyes are wild with fear.

                                     DAGGETT
                         ...You -- your war...

               Gabriel's spread fingers lower themselves toward his face.

                                     GABRIEL
                         C'mon, son, out with it. Make this 
                         one count.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Your war's a lie!

                                     GABRIEL
                              (pauses)
                         What?

                                     DAGGETT
                         Running around acting like this is 
                         really about whether Christ is just 
                         the son of God or if he is God. 
                         Bullshit! That's not what this is 
                         about at all, is it?

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're wrong.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Then prove it to me, Gabriel. I 
                         studied three fucking years of 
                         theology before I picked up a gun. 
                         C'mon, you're chief goddamn angel, 
                         I'm just a little man. Prove to me 
                         Christ is just a son and less than 
                         God. Prove it!

               Gabriel hesitates.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I don't have to.

                                     DAGGETT
                         Because you can't! Because this war 
                         isn't about some obscure medieval 
                         hangup. You're just jealous.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're wrong!

                                     DAGGETT
                         Try me, Gabriel. Go on. Prove to me 
                         the temporal nature of the Trinity. 
                         Show me through logic how the Son of 
                         the Word can be separated from the 
                         Father. Fight me with philosophy, 
                         Gabriel!

                                     GABRIEL
                         No!

                                     DAGGETT
                         Because you and your army are wrong! 
                         And you know it. You knew it sixteen 
                         centuries ago.

                                     GABRIEL
                         We don't have to listen to him! He's 
                         just a son!

                                     DAGGETT
                         That's it. You're jealous. Jealous 
                         He could love something more than 
                         you...

                                     GABRIEL
                              (hisses)
                         Shut up...

               Gabriel's becoming unglued.

                                     DAGGETT
                         If you wanted to know so badly, 
                         Gabriel, why didn't you just ask 
                         Him? Why didn't you just ask God?

               A shudder passes through Gabriel. He straightens up and looks 
               down at Thomas as emotion racks his body.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Because He doesn't talk to us anymore!

               The two stare at one another. Then Gabriel, lost in himself, 
               suddenly turns away from Thomas and walks into the darkness. 
               For the village.

               Thomas climbs quickly to his feet, spins around --

               -- And is HIT full-force by a rabid, SHRIEKING Rachael. Her 
               legs lock around his body vise-like as her teeth and nails 
               DIG into his skin. He cries out and stumbles to the ground. 
               The two grapple furiously in the dust, Rachel's crazed face 
               taking BITE after BITE out of his shoulder and neck.

               Thomas manages a fistfull of her hair and YANKS the fangs 
               off his shoulder. With his other arm he CUFFS her hard, 
               BREAKING the grip and ROLLING her aside. He staggers to his 
               knees and begins to run. Shrieking, a mad porcelain banshee 
               out of the dusk, Rachael catches up and TACKLES him. On the 
               way down his head strikes a small stone wall and the pain is 
               white thunder. Gagging and weeping in blank shock, he crawls 
               on his hands and knees as Rachael OPENS UP his arm from 
               shoulder to elbow with her nails. As the blood tumbles like 
               ribbons, Rachael JUMPS onto his back, DIGGING her claws into 
               his scalp.

               It's about all one human can take.

               Mad with pain and anger and desperation, Thomas manages to 
               climb to a shaky crouch, Rachael still shrieking on his back. 
               Throwing all his weight backward, he JAMS her into the short 
               stone wall. The impact SNAPS her hold and PROPELS her over 
               the wall --

               And two thousand feet down the side of the butte.

               Thomas Daggett can only curl up into a ball, gulping shallow, 
               shuddering breaths.

               IN THE VILLAGE

               Gabriel walks resolutely up to the first hogan and KICKS 
               down the plank wood door. No one home. He walks to the second 
               and KICKS its door down. Nothing.

               IN THE KIVA

               Mary's ceremony is nearing a crescendo. Grey Horse has donned 
               the colorful mask of the yei god Monster Slayer as the 
               relatives now join in the guttural chants of the Enemy Ghost 
               Way. Through the thick, choking smoke of the ceremonial fire 
               we see Katherine, nervously watching the door.

               IN THE DARKNESS OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE

               Thomas tries hopelessly to make his way back. Stumbling every 
               few steps, he's beyond pain and into driven numbness. It's 
               hopeless though. We know it.

               IN THE VILLAGE

               Gabriel KICKS down another door to another empty hogan. 
               There's only one left. As he approaches, from within can be 
               heard the muffled sound of chanting.

               THOMAS

               Takes a few more fumbling steps and falls again. He reaches 
               out to something metal for support. It's Katherine's pickup.

               GABRIEL

               Steps up to the kiva door and KICKS it. The frame buckles 
               but holds. He steps back a few feet, puts all his weight 
               into a turn, and KICKS again. The door SHATTERS.

               INSIDE

               Wood splinters ROCKET through the smoke as Gabriel appears 
               in the doorway. Grey Horse, everyone, freezes.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Relax folks, it's just a soul.

               From out of the smoke steps Katherine. She FIRES, one round, 
               into Gabriel's side. The archangel is pitched against the 
               kiva's wall, where he stays a moment before turning to 
               Katherine.

                                     GABRIEL
                         I'm getting real tired of you.

               She stands her ground between him and the child.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go to hell.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Heaven, darling. Heaven. At least 
                         get the zip code right.

                                     KATHERINE
                         It's all the same, isn't it?

                                     GABRIEL
                         No. In heaven we believe in love.

                                     KATHERINE
                         And what do you love, Gabriel?

               Once again, the shade of doubt holds him up. But it's quickly 
               pushed aside for a corrupted grin. He's given up all pretense.

                                     GABRIEL
                         -- Cracking your skull.

               He advances on her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         That's all it is for you anymore, 
                         Gabriel, isn't it? Just the killing 
                         and the burning. You don't work for 
                         God anymore. You don't fight for 
                         love.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Shut up!

               And he's on her. With his left arm he brutally forces her to 
               her knees as his right hand, palm out and fingers splayed, 
               clamp themselves over her face. Katherine's mouth opens in a 
               silent scream as the pain, immediate and beyond endurance, 
               flows through her body.

               From somewhere outside, there's a sound.

               Katherine gulps chokes of agony as her very clothes begin to 
               smolder around her.

               We hear the sound once more, closer, before --

               The entire kiva wall EXPLODES INWARD as Katherine's pickup 
               CRASHES through it. The mangled grill and hood SLAM into 
               Gabriel from the side and SMASH him to the ground like a 
               broken puppet. Katherine falls backward to the floor, gets 
               up, and runs to the truck's cab. Inside sits a near catatonic 
               Thomas. Katherine takes only a second to share a look with 
               him before reaching back and pulling out the pickup's tire 
               iron.

               Gabriel, a shattered, broken thing, pulls himself up to his 
               knees. The sunglasses are gone and two eyeless pits stare 
               out at Mary, huddled in the corner. Bleeding from every pore, 
               one arm bent back the wrong way, he crawls across the floor 
               toward her, his voice the milky slur of a stroke victim.

                                     GABRIEL
                         God loves you, Mary!

               Katherine brings the tire iron down on his skull with all 
               her might, DRIVING him to the floor. She turns to Grey Horse, 
               her eyes wild.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Finish it.

               He, everyone, just stare. Stunned to stone.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Finish it!

               Grey Horse timidly picks up his prayer stick and with a voice 
               faltering and cracked, in the insane glare of the wrecked 
               pickup's headlights, resumes the Enemy Ghost Way chant.

               Katherine turns back to Gabriel.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Go home.

               She HITS him again with the tire iron. Then lifts it high 
               once more above her head. She's going to crush him, to implode 
               his skull.

               When a hand stops her.

               Sort of a hand. A claw. Lucifer's. He's standing behind her, 
               holding the raised bar still.

                                     LUCIFER
                         No.

               Katherine releases the bar and lets it clang to the floor. 
               Lucifer turns to the villagers, gazing fearfully at him as 
               they awkwardly try to finish the chant.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Please. Go on.

               Lucifer's gaze falls on a deeply fucked-up Gabriel who groans 
               at the sight of him.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Oh man, this just isn't my day.

               Lucifer kneels down beside him. Katherine instinctively starts 
               to reach for the tire iron but the sycophant hisses a liquid, 
               chattering warning at her.

                                     LUCIFER
                         Long time.

                                     GABRIEL
                         The world's young, man.

                                     LUCIFER
                         And full of ambition.

                                     GABRIEL
                         This isn't your war.

                                     LUCIFER
                         But I remember the last one. Michael's 
                         war.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You lost.

                                     LUCIFER
                         But lots of angels were with me. 
                         every one followed their leader out 
                         of heaven.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Yeah yeah, I was there, remember?

                                     LUCIFER
                         Except one. Oh, he was with me all 
                         right. He hated the Eagle Scout. 
                         Envied the power He gave to His Son. 
                         But this angel never came out front 
                         during the war. And when it ended he 
                         thought maybe, maybe the Eagle Scout 
                         didn't notice. So he laid low and 
                         towed the company line till he could 
                         start his own war. It was all just 
                         jealousy.

                                     GABRIEL
                         You're dreaming.

                                     LUCIFER
                         But maybe He did notice. Maybe that's 
                         why I'm here.

                                     GABRIEL
                         -- Stay away from me.

                                     LUCIFER
                         You've always been a part of me, 
                         Gabriel. And now it's time to come 
                         home.

                                     GABRIEL
                         Fuck you!

               Lucifer slams Gabriel's head against the floor and pins it. 
               As the angel thrashes furiously, Lucifer FORCES his arm into 
               Gabriel's chest. Gabriel cries out as Lucifer PULLS his arm 
               half out and FORCES it deeper. Again. And again. Soon 
               Gabriel's screams become giggles, then a crazed, hysterical 
               laughter.

               The room goes insane. An impossible nightmare of chanting 
               Navahos, glaring headlights, and Gabriel's echoing laughter 
               as Lucifer pumps his chest. Laughter that rises to a kind of 
               orgasmic cry then instantly stops as Lucifer pulls out the 
               angel's heart,

               And eats it.

               At that instant Grey Horse places his hand on Mary's forehead,

               Sticky, smoky, awful silence. Gabriel is a non-thing. A 
               battered, hollow shell.

               Bartholomew Grey Horse, his voice cracked and finished, turns 
               to Katherine.

                                     GREY HORSE
                         The enemy spirit is gone.

                         Where?

               From outside the kiva suddenly comes the sound of a wounded, 
               savage GROWL. Katherine walks to the doorway. Just outside a 
               lone coyote is twisting in the dirt with furious agony. 
               Abruptly its thrashings cease. The animal stands and flashes 
               for an instant at Katherine cold yellow eyes more than animal. 
               Then it's gone into the blackness. Forever.

               She turns and goes back to Thomas in the cab. Bleeding to 
               death is a real possibility for him. She pulls an old shirt 
               out of the back and tries to makeshift a wrap for his sliced 
               arm.

                         And they won't find it. Not in Mary.

               A few of the village elders appear at the cab.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Can you help him?

                         We have some bandages.

               Katherine walks over to where Mary, sweaty and shaken, sits 
               huddled in a corner attended by Grey Horse.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Are you all right, pumpkin?

               Mary's voice shakes as tears roll out her eyes.

                                     MARY
                         I'm okay.

               Katherine gathers her up into her arms and holds her.

                                     KATHERINE
                         It's going to be okay... We're all 
                         going to be okay...

               The chattering, hissing sycophant grabs Gabriel's body by 
               the hair and shoulders and drags it out the door. Lucifer 
               has remained behind, crouched on his haunches, his liquid, 
               yellow eyes on Katherine.

                                     KATHERINE
                         I can't quite bring myself to say 
                         thank you.

                                     LUCIFER
                         I understand.

                         Then this is done.

                         Not necessarily. Maybe I like you. 
                         Maybe I want you to come with me.

               He rises to his feet and steps slowly toward her.

                                     LUCIFER
                         You owe me, Katherine. And you're 
                         going to ask me to take you home.

                         way is going to be more awful than

                         Are you threatening me?

               Just a grinning, twisted stare.

                                     KATHERINE
                         Then you've picked the wrong person 
                         this time. I've just about had it up 
                         to here with ghosts. So you can put 
                         away the horror movie sneer and the 
                         K-Mart halloween eyes, because we 
                         know you now. We know you all. And 
                         if you want to force the issue then 
                         go ahead because you're just another 
                         angel to me. Take a look at your 
                         buddy Gabriel. Then ask yourself, do 
                         you really, really want to fuck with 
                         us?

               The smallest hint of a pause.

                         Perhaps another time.

               And he's gone. Through the door and into the night.

               The Navaho cops are talking with Katherine and Mary. Thomas

	FADE IN:

	EXT. PHOENIX, ARIZONA - (DAY) - HELICOPTER SHOT

	Above Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a 
	hot mid-summer day. The city is sun-sunblanched white and 
	its drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes. 
	We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over 
	traffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business 
	buildings, neatly patterned residential districts. As we 
	approach downtown section, the character of the city begins 
	to change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We 
	see railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and-
	vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots.  
	vegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of 
	nefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy. And secret.

	We fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific 
	location. A skinny, high old hotel comes into view. On its 
	exposed brick side great painted letters advertise "Transients-
	Low Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room." We pause long enough 
	to establish the shoddy character of this hotel. Its open, 
	curtainless windows, its silent resigned look so 
	characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward 
	with purposefulness and-toward a certain window. The sash is 
	raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to 
	three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants 
	of the room within wanted privacy but needed air. We are 
	close now, so that only the lower half of the window frame 
	is in shot. No sounds come from within the room.

	Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between 
	shade and sill, peep into the room.

	A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears 
	a full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitude 
	of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of 
	the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome 
	conflicts. She is MARY CRANE, an tension, attractive girl 
	nearing the end of her twenties and her rope.

	A man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure 
	visible. We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then 
	start forward. As we pass under the window shade,

							 CUT TO:

	INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - (DAY)

	A small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow 
	bed. A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the 
	bureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open-
	top handbag are on the bureau.

	On the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco-
	Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There 
	is no radio.

	The man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt 
	and sox, is SAM LOOMIS, a good-looking, sensual shirt man 
	with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is blotting 
	his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at 
	Mary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth. Mary keeps 
	her face turned away from him.

	After a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans 
	over and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her long and warmly, 
	holds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed 
	and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an 
	inconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow 
	Mary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns 
	at her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, intimate, 
	playful voice.

				SAM
		Never did eat your lunch, did you.

	Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, 
	kisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings 
	her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds 
	her shoes, slips her feet into searches them. And finally 
	pulls away and sits up.

				MARY
		I better get back to the office.  
		These extended lunch hours give my 
		boss excess acid.

	She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings 
	out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or 
	perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam 
	watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, 
	humorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they 
	occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc.

				SAM
		Call your boss and tell him you're 
		taking the rest of the afternoon 
		off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.

				MARY
			(soft sarcasm)
		What do I do with my free afternoon, 
		walk you to the airport?

				SAM
			(meaningfully)
		We could laze around here a while 
		longer.

				MARY
		Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels 
		of this sort aren't interested in 
		you when you come in, but when your 
		time's up...
			(a small anguish)
		Sam, I hate having to be with you in 
		a place like this.

				SAM
		I've heard of married couples who 
		deliberately spend occasional nights 
		in cheap hotels. They say it...

				MARY
			(interrupting)
		When you're married you can do a lot 
		of things deliberately.

				SAM
		You sure talk like a girl who's been 
		married.

				MARY
		Sam!

				SAM
		I'm sorry, Mary.
			(after a moment)
		My old Dad used to say 'when you 
		can't change a situation, laugh at 
		it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like 
		laughing at it.

				MARY
		I've lost my girlish laughter.

				SAM
			(observing)
		The only girlish thing you have lost.

				MARY
			(a meaningful quiet, 
			then, with difficulty:)
		Sam. This is the last time.

				SAM
		For what?

				MARY
		This! Meeting you in secret so we 
		can be... secretive! You come down 
		here on business trips and we steal 
		lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't 
		even come.

				SAM
		Okay. What do we do instead, write 
		each other lurid love letters?

				MARY
			(about to argue, then 
			turning away)
		I haven't time to argue. I'm a working 
		girl.

				SAM
		And I'm a working man! We're a regular 
		working-class tragedy!
			(he laughs)

				MARY
		It is tragic! Or it will be... if we 
		go on meeting in shabby hotels 
		whenever you can find a tax-deductible 
		excuse for flying down deductible 
		here...

				SAM
			(interrupting, 
			seriously)
		You can't laugh at it, huh?

				MARY
		Can you?

				SAM
		Sure. It's like laughing through a 
		broken jaw, but...

	He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, 
	tries to raise the shade. It sticks. He pulls at it.

	It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room, 
	revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if 
	corroborating Mary's words and attitude. Sam kicks at the 
	fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor 
	again.

				SAM
		And besides, when you say I make tax-
		deductible excuses you make me out a 
		criminal.

				MARY
			(having to smile)
		You couldn't be a criminal if you 
		committed a major crime.

				SAM
		I wish I were. Not an active criminal 
		but... a nice guy with the conscience 
		of a criminal.
			(goes close to mary, 
			touches her)
		Next best thing to no conscience at 
		all.

				MARY
			(pulling away)
		I have to go, Sam.

				SAM
		I can come down next week.

				MARY
		No.

				SAM
		Not even just to see you, to have 
		lunch... in public?

				MARY
		We can see each other, we can even 
		have dinner... but respectably, in 
		my house with my mother's picture on 
		the mantel and my sister helping me 
		broil a big steak for three!

				SAM
		And after the steak... do we send 
		Sister to the movies and turn Mama's 
		picture to the wall?

				MARY
		Sam! No!

				SAM
			(after a pause, simply)
		All right.

	She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue 
	the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised 
	when they discover men will continue to want them even after 
	the sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, 
	places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and 
	simple sincerity.

				SAM
		Mary, whenever it's possible, tax-
		deductible or not, I want to see 
		deductible you. And under any 
		conditions.
			(a smile)
		Even respectability.

				MARY
		You make respectability sound...  
		disrespectful.

				SAM
			(brightly)
		I'm all for it! It requires patience 
		and temperance and a lot of sweating-
		out... otherwise, though, it's only 
		hard work.
			(a pause)
		But if I can see you, touch you even 
		as simply as this... I won't mind.

	He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems 
	crushes away his good humor. There is a quiet moment.

				SAM
		I'm fed up with sweating for people 
		who aren't there. I sweat to pay off 
		my father's debts... and he's in his 
		grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife 
		alimony, and she's living on the 
		other side of the world somewhere.

				MARY
			(a smile)
		I pay, too. They also pay who meet 
		in hotel rooms.

				SAM
		A couple of years and the debts will 
		be paid off. And if she ever re-
		marries, the alimony stops... and 
		then...

				MARY
		I haven't even been married once 
		yet!

				SAM
		Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.

				MARY
			(smiling, then with a 
			terrible urgency)
		Sam, let's go get married.

				SAM
		And live with me in a storeroom behind 
		a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll 
		have a lot of laughs. When I send my 
		ex-wife her money, you can lick the 
		stamps.

				MARY
			(a deep desperation)
		I'll lick the stamps.

	He looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, 
	looks out the window and stares at the wide sky.

				SAM
		You know what I'd like? A clear, 
		empty sky... and a plane, and us in 
		it... and somewhere a private island 
		for sale, where we can run around 
		without our... shoes on.  And the 
		wherewithal to buy what I'd like.
			(he moves away, 
			suddenly serious)
		Mary, you want to cut this off, go 
		out and find yourself someone 
		available.

				MARY
		I'm thinking of it.

				SAM
			(a cheerful shout)
		How can you even think a thing like 
		that!

				MARY
			(picking up handbag, 
			starting for door)
		Don't miss your plane.

				SAM
		Hey, we can leave together can't we?

				MARY
			(at door)
		I'm late... and you have to put your 
		shoes on.

	Mary goes out quickly, closing door behind her. As Sam stares 
	down at his shoeless feet,

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - (DAY) - HIGH ANGLE

	Shooting down at hotel entrance. Mary comes out, walks quickly 
	to a parked cab, gets in. The cab zooms up the awful street.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. LOWERY REAL ESTATE OFFICE - (DAY)

	A small, moderately successful office off the main street. A 
	cab pulls up at the curb. We see Mary get out of cab, pay 
	driver, cross pavement to the office door.

	INT. OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)

	Mary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her 
	temples, finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last 
	of her teens.

				MARY
		Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?

				CAROLINE
			(a high, bright, eager-
			to-talk voice laced 
			to-with a vague Texan 
			accent)
		He's lunching with the man who's 
		buying the Harris Street property, 
		you know, that oil lease man...  so 
		that's why he's late.
			(a pause, then, as 
			Mary does not respond 
			to the pointed thrust)
		You getting a headache?

				MARY
		It'll pass. Headaches are like 
		resolutions... you forget them soon 
		as they stop hurting.

				CAROLINE
		You got aspirins? I have something... 
		not aspirins, but
			(cheerfully takes 
			bottle of pills out 
			of desk drawer)
		my mother's doctor gave these to me 
		the day of my wedding.
			(laughs)
		Teddy was furious when he found out 
		I'd taken tranquilizers!

	She rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand.

				MARY
		Were there any calls?

				CAROLINE
		Teddy called.  Me... And my mother 
		called to see if Teddy called. Oh, 
		and your sister called to say she's 
		going to Tucson to do some buying 
		and she'll be gone the whole weekend 
		and...

	She breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening. 
	MR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY enter the 
	office. Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a 
	trifle pompous. Cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch-
	hour load on. He is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful 
	vulgarity.

				CASSIDY
		Wow! Hot as fresh milk! You girls 
		should get your boss to air-condition 
		you up. He can afford it today.

	Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead 
	Cassidy toward the private office.

				LOWERY
		Mary, will you get those copies of 
		the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy.

	Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the 
	desktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary.

				CASSIDY
		Tomorrow's the day! My sweet little 
		girl...
			(laughs as Mary looks 
			up at him)
		Not you, my daughter!  A baby, and 
		tomorrow she stands up there and 
		gets her sweet self married away 
		from me!
			(pulling out wallet)
		I want you to look at my baby.  
		Eighteen years old... and she's never 
		had an unhappy day in any one of 
		those years!
			(flashes photo)

	Mary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some 
	remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore 
	the man's hot-breath closeness.

				LOWERY
		Come on, Tom, my office is air-
		conditioned.

				CASSIDY
			(ignoring Lowery)
		You know what I do with unhappiness? 
		I buy it off! You unhappy?

				MARY
		Not inordinately.
			(puts deed copy into 
			Cassidy's too-close 
			hand)

				CASSIDY
		I'm buying this house for my baby's 
		wedding present. Forty thousand 
		dollars, cash! Now that ain't buying 
		happiness, that's buying off 
		unhappiness! That penniless punk 
		she's marryin'...
			(laughs)
		Probably a good kid... it's just 
		that I hate him.
			(looks at deed)
		Yup! Forty thousand, says here...
			(to Lowery)
		Casharoonie!

	He takes out of his inside pocket, two separate bundles of 
	new $100 bills and throws them onto the desk, under Mary's 
	nose. Caroline's eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious 
	green bundles of bills, and she comes close to the desk. 
	Cassidy leans terribly close to Mary, flicks through the 
	bills, laughs wickedly.

				CASSIDY
		I never carry more than I can afford 
		to lose!
			(closer to Mary)
		Count 'em!

				LOWERY
			(shocked, worried)
		Tom... cash transactions of this 
		size! Most irregular...

				CASSIDY
		So what? It's my private money!
			(laughs, winks, elbows 
			Lowery)
		And now it's yours.

				CAROLINE
			(staring at the money)
		I declare!

				CASSIDY
			(whispering)
		I don't! That's how I'm able to keep 
		it!
			(laughs)

				LOWERY
			(hastily interrupting)
		Suppose we just put this in the safe 
		and then Monday morning when you're 
		feeling good...

				CASSIDY
		Speakin' of feeling good, where's 
		that bottle you said you had in your 
		desk...
			(laughs, as if having 
			given away Lowery's 
			secret)
		Oops!
			(to Mary, patting her 
			arm)
		Usually I can keep my mouth shut!

	He rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks 
	to Mary, meaningfully.

				CASSIDY
		Honest. I can keep any private 
		transaction a secret... any pri....
			(stopped by Mary's 
			cold gaze)
		Lowery! I'm dyin' of thirstaroonie!

	Lowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary. Cassidy has 
	gone into Lower's office.

				LOWERY
			(quietly)
		I don't even want it in the office 
		over the weekend. Put it in the safe 
		deposit box, at the bank, Mary. And 
		we'll get him to give us a check on 
		Monday - instead.

	He starts quickly away when it looks like Cassidy is going 
	to come and pull him bodily into the office. When the men 
	are gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle, 
	smiles at it.

				CAROLINE
		He was flirting with you. I guess he 
		noticed my wedding ring.

	Mary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the 
	other from Caroline. When the bills are away, she puts the 
	filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed 
	copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office 
	door, knocks, starts to open door as:

				LOWERY (O.S.)
		Come in.

	INT. LOWERY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - (DAY)

	Mary opens door, looks in. Cassidy is drinking from a large 
	tumbler, winks at her without pausing in his drinking. Mary 
	remains on threshold a moment, then crosses to the desk, 
	talking as she goes.

				MARY
		The copies. Mr. Lowery, if you don't 
		mind, I'd like to go right on home 
		after the bank. I have a slight...

				CASSIDY
		You go right home!  Me and your boss 
		are going out to get ourselves a 
		little drinkin' done!
			(to Lowery)
		Right?

				LOWERY
			(to Mary)
		Of course. You feeling ill?

				MARY
		A headache.

				CASSIDY
		You need a week-end in Las Vegas... 
		playground of the world!

				MARY
		I'm going to spend this week-end in 
		bed.
			(starts out)

				CASSIDY
			(to Lowery)
		Only playground that beats Las Vegas!

	Mary goes back out into the outer office, closes door.

	INT. OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)

	Mary goes to her desk, takes the handbag, checks to make 
	sure the money-filled envelope is tucked well down into it. 
	During this:

				CAROLINE
		Aren't you going to take the pills?
			(as Mary shakes her 
			head)
		They'll knock that headache out.

				MARY
		I don't need pills... just sleep.

	She goes to the door.

							 DISSOLVE:

	INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - (DAY)

	A double bed in the foreground. We just see the far side as 
	the CAMERA SHOOTS across. Mary enters the scene, clad only 
	in her slip. Perhaps she is about to get into bed. Behind 
	her is an open closet, but too dark inside for us to see any 
	contents. As Mary turns to the closet the CAMERA LOWERS to 
	show a close view of the $40,000 in the envelope on our side 
	of the bed.

	Mary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on 
	as the CAMERA RETREATS to reveal a packed but not yet closed 
	suitcase also on the bed. Mary zips up her dress and then 
	brings some final garments from the closet.

	She comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top. 
	Mary works with haste and in tension, as if acting on an 
	impulse which might vanish as quickly as it came.

	The suitcase filled now, she checks around the room, then 
	takes her handbag to the bed, puts in the money-filled 
	envelope, and then slams the suitcase shut. Then filled she 
	looks at her small bedroom desk, goes to it, removes a small 
	file-envelope from one of the drawers. It is one of those 
	brown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and 
	policies and certificates. She checks its contents briefly, 
	puts it on the bed, opens another desk drawer, takes out her 
	bank book, tosses it on the bed. Then she packs both the 
	file-envelope and the bank book, into her handbag, takes one 
	quick last look around the room, picks up the handbag and 
	the suitcase and goes out of the room.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. MARY'S GARAGE - (DAY)

	A two-car garage. One car is gone. Mary's car is parked in 
	the driveway. The CAMERA is low enough so that we can easily 
	read the Arizona number plate in the foreground.

	Mary comes out of house, starts for the trunk, intending to 
	put the suitcase in, changes her mind, places the suitcase 
	and her handbag on the front seat, gets in, starts the car, 
	begins to back out of driveway.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)

	We are close on Mary's car, shooting in at her troubled, 
	guilty face. She seems to be driving with that excess care 
	of one who does not wish to be stopped for a minor traffic 
	irregularity. She stops for a red light at a main 
	intersection.

	FROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT - (DAY)

	We see Lowery and Cassidy crossing the street, passing right 
	in front of Mary's car.

	MARY'S CAR - (DAY)

	Mary freezes.

	EXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)

	Cassidy, glancing into car, sees Mary, lets out a cheery 
	exclamation, elbows Lowery. Lowery turns, sees Mary, smiles 
	pleasantly, pulls Cassidy on.

	MARY'S CAR - (DAY)

	Mary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror 
	on her face.

	EXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)

	Now we look closely at Lowery. As he reaches the curb, a 
	small confusion brightens his face. He remembers that Mary 
	intended to "spend the weekend in bed." He considers, 
	curiously, turns, looks back at her, a slight frown on his 
	face.

	MARY'S CAR - (DAY)

	Mary sees the pause and the look.

	EXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)

	For a moment it even looks as if Lowery might be meaning to 
	cross back to the car.

	MARY'S CAR - (DAY)

	Mary's tension is unbearable. And at that moment we hear the 
	shrill shriek of the traffic cop's whistle.

	Mary zooms the car away.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY - (DAY)

	Mary in car, driving, safely away from town. Her look is 
	less tense now, and more purposeful. After a moment, she 
	checks the fuel gauge, frowns, looks along highway for a gas 
	station.

								 FAST DISSOLVE TO:

	MARY'S CAR - (DAY)

	Approaching and leaving city limits.

	MARY - (DAY)

	Looks at gas gauge.

	C.U. GAS GAUGE - (DAY)

	EXT. A GAS STATION - (DAY)

	We see Mary's car drive in, come to a stop. There are no 
	other cars about, this being a gas station off the main 
	highway, and the attendant is obviously in the shack. Mary 
	looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face 
	turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen.

	No one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on, as 
	if the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that 
	she should listen to. But the gas registers almost empty. 
	She has to blow her horn.

	A YOUNG MAN comes out of the shack, starts toward her car.

	At that moment, we HEAR the RINGING of the TELEPHONE in the 
	shack. The Attendant walks a few steps further, toward Mary's 
	car, then decides to go back and answer the phone. The phone's 
	insistent ringing unnerves Mary.

	She starts her car, zooms off.

	We see the Attendant, phone in hand, in the doorway of shack. 
	He looks after the departing car with little or no expression.

	CAR

	The car grows smaller as it races up the road. The sun is 
	setting. There is something vaguely ominous about the 
	darkening sky into which the car seems to be disappearing.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	MARY IN CAR - (NIGHT)

	The oncoming headlights hurt Mary's eyes. She is getting 
	sleepy and her vision is blurring. Her eyes close, 
	involuntarily, snap open again. She stretches than wide, as 
	if forcing them to stay open. The oncoming lights seem to 
	glare to a point beyond endurance. She murmurs "Sam - Sam."

								LONG LAP DISSOLVE:

	EXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)

	We see Mary's car, dim in the early dawn, tilted on the soft 
	shoulder of the road, looking somehow sad and pathetic, like 
	a child's thrown-away toy. And from this angle it would appear 
	that the car is empty.

	After a moment, during which there are no other vehicles 
	passing, we see, coming from the far distance, a HIGHWAY 
	PATROLMAN in a patrol car. He passes Mary's car, notes its 
	apparent emptiness, U-turns, comes back up behind the car. 
	He gets out and approaches the driver's side window.

	EXT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)

	The Patrolman looks down into the car.

	INT. CAR (DAWN) FROM HIS VIEWPOINT

	Mary turns with a start, sits up, is startled and unnerved 
	by the sight of the Patrolman, and, as if by automatic reflex, 
	turns the ignition and presses down on the starter.

	EXT. CAR (DAWN)

	The Patrolman holds up his hand.

				PATROLMAN
			(startled)
		Hold it there!

	Mary slams down on the brake, tries to pull herself together. 
	The Patrolman raps again, less gently.

	Reluctantly, Mary rolls down the window. The Patrolman studies 
	her for a moment.

				PATROLMAN
		In quite a hurry.

				MARY
		Yes.
			(because he seems to 
			be awaiting an 
			explanation)
		I didn't mean to sleep so long. I 
		was afraid I'd have an accident last 
		night, from sleepiness... so I decided 
		to pull over...

				PATROLMAN
		You slept here all night?

				MARY
			(a faint edge of 
			defensiveness)
		Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my 
		eyes...

				PATROLMAN
			(mere concern)
		There are plenty of motels in this 
		area. You should have... I mean, 
		just to be safe...

				MARY
		I didn't intend to sleep all night!
		I just pulled over... have I broken 
		any laws?

				PATROLMAN
		No, m'am.

				MARY
		Then I'm free to go...?

				PATROLMAN
			(a pause)
		Is anything wrong?

				MARY
		Of course not! Am I acting as if... 
		something's wrong?

				PATROLMAN
			(almost a smile)
		Frankly, yes.

				MARY
		Please... I'd like to go...

				PATROLMAN
		Is there?

				MARY
		Is there what?
			(not waiting for an 
			answer)
		I've told you there's nothing wrong... 
		except that I'm in a hurry and you're 
		taking up my time...

				PATROLMAN
			(interrupting, sternly)
		Now wait just a moment! Turn your 
		motor off, please.

	Mary seems about to object, thinks better of it, turns off 
	the ignition.

				PATROLMAN
		In the course of my duty, I never 
		"take up" anyone's time, whether 
		it's to give a warning, or a ticket, 
		or help! Believe that, M'am.
			(a little softer)
		Now if you woke up on the wrong side 
		of... the car seat, that's one thing. 
		But when you act as if I've just 
		placed you under arrest...

				MARY
		I'm sorry.

				PATROLMAN
		No need to apologize...

	Mary starts the car, her face turned as if she wishes the 
	matter were all settled and the Patrolman had already gone. 
	The Patrolman isn't exactly one of those civil servants who 
	demands a thank-you, but he does feel her manner is a bit 
	too abrupt. He calls:

				PATROLMAN
		Wait a minute!

				MARY
			(jamming down the 
			brake)
		Now what?

	The Patrolman gazes at her a moment, then:

				PATROLMAN
		May I see your license?

				MARY
		Why?

				PATROLMAN
		Please.

	Mary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she'd placed 
	it when she stretched out for sleep. She puts her hand in 
	it, rummages for her wallet, cannot find it.

	The Patrolman is staring at her. She glances at him nervously, 
	pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, realizes she'll have to 
	remove some of its contents. Nervously, badly controlling 
	her fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, and then 
	the important papers envelope, filled then a couple of other 
	items, places them on the seat, finally finds her wallet, 
	opens it, hands it to him. He looks at the wallet, then at 
	the car.

	EXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)

	The Patrolman walks around to the front of the car, checks 
	the license plate, and returns.

	INT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)

	The Patrolman peers in, checks the car registration on the 
	steering wheel, returns Mary's wallet.

	She takes it, looks at him for a flicker of a moment.

	He says nothing. She starts ahead, fast.

	EXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)

	The Patrolman stares after Mary as she drives off, then starts 
	back to his automobile.

	MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)

	She is quite shaken, realizes she caused herself a great 
	deal of trouble and placed herself in unnecessary danger. 
	She is disturbed and angry and frightened at her inability 
	to act normally under the pressure of guilt. As she drives, 
	she glances into her rear-view mirror.

	MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN)

	The Patrolman is following in his automobile, keeping behind 
	her at a matched speed.

	MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)

	She glances out at her surroundings.

	MARY'S POV - (DAWN)

	The Freeway ahead.

	EXT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)

	She suddenly turns off the highway.

	MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)

	She checks her mirror.

	MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN)

	The Patrolman is no longer following, has not turned off 
	after her.

	MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)

	She breathes a sigh of relief, thinks a moment, makes a quick 
	decision.

							 DISSOLVE:

	EXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

	The big sign reads "California Charlie - Automobile Paradise." 
	We see Mary's car drive onto the lot and stop. Mary gets out 
	of the car, glances toward the lot office, turns her attention 
	to the line of cars, notice the California licence plates on 
	all of them. The CAR DEALER calls out from his office:

				CAR DEALER
		With you in a second!

	Mary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making 
	a selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand 
	on the corner, just outside the lot.

	She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is 
	fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy 
	herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, 
	picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car 
	lot as she glances worried at the front page. As she goes, 
	we see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same 
	PATROLMAN. He sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite 
	side of the street, stops by the curb. Mary, engrossed in 
	the newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see 
	the Patrolman.

	The car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting 
	for Mary. As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles.

				CAR DEALER
		I'm in no mood for trouble!

				MARY
			(glancing up, thrown 
			for a moment)
		What?

				CAR DEALER
			(cheerfully)
		There's an old saying, "First customer 
		of the day is always the most 
		trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no 
		mood for it so I'm just going to 
		treat you so fair and square you 
		won't have one human reason to give 
		me...

				MARY
			(interrupting)
		Can I trade in my car and take 
		another?

				CAR DEALER
		You can do anything you've a mind 
		to... and bein' a woman, you will!
			(chin-indicating her 
			car)
		That yours?

				MARY
		Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, 
		I'm just...

				CAR DEALER
		Sick of the sight of it!
			(laughs)
		Well, suppose you look around for 
		something that strikes your eyes and 
		meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give 
		yours the once over and... want some 
		coffee? I was just about...

				MARY
		No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I 
		just want to make a change and 
		start...

	She stops suddenly, almost with a gasp. She has seen the 
	Patrolman.

	THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)

	He is staring over at her, his face dispassionate.

	EXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

	Mary has to force herself to look away.

				CAR DEALER
		One thing people never ought to be 
		when they're buying a used car is in 
		a hurry!
			(starting away toward 
			her car)
		But like I said, too nice a day for 
		arguing. I'll just shoot this into 
		the garage.

	He starts into Mary's car. She looks at him, in near panic, 
	wanting to skip the whole thing. Torn, wondering if the 
	presence of the Patrolman doesn't negate the value of changing 
	cars, wondering how she can get away, wondering if she'll be 
	followed, or if the Patrolman will go away if she does stay 
	here.

	All these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing. 
	The Car Dealer has driven her car into the garage. She stands 
	in the middle of the lot, feeling like a shooting target. 
	She looks toward the garage.

	THE GARAGE - MARY'S POV - (DAY)

	Mary's car is in it.

	EXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

	Mary decides she cannot back out now without arousing further 
	suspicion, is compelled to look again at the Patrolman.

	THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)

	He still watches. With a self-angry sigh of resignment, she 
	goes to a close car, looks at it. The Car Dealer is returning.

				CAR DEALER
		That's the one I'd've picked for you 
		myself!

				MARY
		How much?

				CAR DEALER
		Go ahead! Spin it around the block. 
		Now I know you don't know anything 
		about engine condition, but you can 
		feel, can't you... and it's all in 
		the feel, believe me, you feel that 
		one around the block...

				MARY
		It looks fine. How much will it be, 
		with my car...?

				CAR DEALER
		You mean you don't want the usual 
		day and a half to think it over?
			(laughs)
		You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' 
		you?

				MARY
		Of course not. Please.

				CAR DEALER
		Well... heck, this is the first time 
		I ever saw the customer high-pressure 
		the salesman!
			(laughs, sees she is 
			in no mood for it)
		I'd figure roughly...
			(looks at the car, 
			then back at the 
			garage)
		...your car plus five hundred.

				MARY
		Five hundred.

				CAR DEALER
		Aha! Always got time to argue money, 
		huh...?

				MARY
		All right.

	As the car dealer looks at her in amazement, she reaches 
	into her bag, feels the money-filled envelope, pauses.

				CAR DEALER
			(slowly)
		I take it... you can prove that car's 
		yours... I mean, out of state and 
		all... got your pink slip and your...

				MARY
		I think I have the necessary papers. 
		Is there a Ladies Room...

				CAR DEALER
		In the building ...
			(indicates, continues 
			to stare quietly)
		Mary starts for the building, glancing 
		once in the direction of the 
		Patrolman.

	THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)

	He still sits, his motor throbbing, his face quiet.

	EXT. THE USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

	Mary goes into the office building.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. LADIES ROOM - (DAY)

	Mary enters, locks door, takes envelope out of her handbag, 
	extracts one bundle of bills from the envelope, counts off 
	five, puts the bundle back into the envelope and the envelope 
	back into the bag. Then she remembers, takes out the important 
	papers envelope, goes through it, finds several papers having 
	to do with her car, takes them all out, puts back the 
	envelope, starts out of the ladies Room.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. THE USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

	The Car Dealer has moved the car of her choice out of the 
	line. It stands in the clearing.

				CAR DEALER
			(too cheerfully)
		I think you'd better give it a trial 
		spin. Don't want any bad word of 
		mouth about California Charlie.

				MARY
		I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't 
		we just settle this and...

				CAR DEALER
		I'll be perfectly honest with you, 
		Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust 
		you, but...

				MARY
			(interrupting)
		But what?  Is there anything so 
		terribly wrong about... making a 
		decision and wanting to hurry? Do 
		you think I've stolen... my car?

				CAR DEALER
		No, M'am. I was only about to say, 
		I've sent my mechanic out to give 
		your car a little test... that's 
		all.

				MARY
			(handing him the 
			ownership papers and 
			the new bills)
		I'd like to be ready when he gets 
		back.

				CAR DEALER
		Okay. If you'll come along...

	He starts toward the office building. Mary follows, closely, 
	anxiously. She glances, sees:

	THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)

	He is still at the far curb.

	EXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

	The Car Dealer goes into his office. Mary follows.

	THE PATROLMAN - (DAY)

	A second later, he starts his automobile, checks traffic, 
	comes across the street, slowly, and drives onto the lot. He 
	pauses a moment, then drives across the lot, passing the 
	office, going on to the other exit, stops there as Mary's 
	car is driven back onto the lot.

	The MECHANIC stops Mary's car, hops out, waves to the 
	Patrolman. The Patrolman waves back, goes on a bit until he 
	is behind Mary's car, stops again, looks over at the office. 
	In a moment, Mary comes out, hurries across to her new car, 
	gets in, starts the motor. The Mechanic yells:

				MECHANIC
		Hey! Miss?

	Mary pauses, turns, sees the Patrolman, then the Mechanic. 
	Her face goes white. She doesn't know which man called her. 
	Then the Mechanic waves, starts forward with her suitcase.

				MARY
			(as Mechanic reaches 
			car)
		Just put it right in here, please... 
		beside me.

	The Mechanic smiles, throws the suitcase in. Mary zooms off. 
	As she drives out of lot we see the Mechanic, the Car Dealer 
	and the Patrolman all looking after her.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE

	Mary is driving tensely. She checks the rear-view mirror, is 
	more shocked than pleased when she sees...

	MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR

	No sign of the Patrolman.

	MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE

	She turns her face, looks out at the highway.

	ROUTE 99 - MARY'S POV

	It is heavy with traffic.

	MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE

	Again she checks the mirror and although...

	MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR

	There is still no sign of the Patrolman.

	MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE

	She cannot relax or feel safe, cannot convince herself that 
	nothing will come of the man's watching and suspicions.

	CAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, 
	her fears. Her guilt shines bright in her eyes and she is a 
	person unaccustomed to containing this much guilt in this 
	realistic a situation. Suddenly, we hear the SOUND of the 
	Used Car Dealer's laugh, hear it as clearly as Mary hears it 
	in her imagination. The "imagined voice" we hear is actually 
	the voice of the Car Dealer:

				CAR DEALER'S VOICE
		Heck, Officer, that was the first 
		time I ever saw the Customer high-
		pressure the Salesman!  Somebody 
		chasing her?

				PATROLMAN'S VOICE
		I better have a look at those papers, 
		Charlie.

				CAR DEALER'S VOICE
		She look like a wrong-one to you?

				PATROLMAN'S VOICE
		Acted like one.

	Mary blinks, shakes her head, as if trying to shake away 
	these voices of her imagination. She checks the rear-view 
	mirror.

	MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR

	Still no sight of the Patrolman.

	MARY IN NEW CAR

	She tries to force herself to relax, almost succeeds when 
	she is sprung to tension again by....

	EXT. HIGHWAY

	The sight of a police car. As she drives past, we hear the 
	squeaky, unintelligible voice coming over the car radio. 
	Mary zooms down on the gas, whizzes ahead.

					DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY 99 - LONG SHOT

	Mary's car dashing along.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	MARY IN NEW CAR

	Mary looks weary, tired with strain and with hard driving. 
	Her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought.

	OUT THE WINDSHIELD

	We can see that it is much later in the day, almost dusk.

	MARY IN NEW CAR

	We HEAR the sound of an agitated BUZZ of an intercom system, 
	a sound emanating from Mary's imagination.

	After the second BUZZ, we HEAR the voice of Caroline.

				CAROLINE'S VOICE
		Yes, Mr. Lowery.

				LOWERY'S VOICE
			(a worried tone)
		Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?

				CAROLINE'S VOICE
		No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's 
		always a bit late on Monday mornings.

				LOWERY'S VOICE
		Buzz me the minute she comes in.

	Again Mary shakes her head, forces herself to stop hearing 
	these "invented" scenes of her imagination.

	EXT. HIGHWAY

	Now we cut to the view of the road, from Mary's viewpoint. 
	Darkness of evening is coming. In the dim twilight we see 
	the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations 
	beginning to blaze on.

	INT. MARY'S NEW CAR

	Back on Mary's face, and after a moment, the imagined voices 
	again:

				LOWERY'S VOICE
		Call her sister! If no one's answering 
		at the house....

				CAROLINE'S VOICE
		I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, 
		where she works, the Music Makers 
		Music Store, you know? And she doesn't 
		know where Mary is any more than we 
		do.

				LOWERY'S VOICE
		You better run out to the house.  
		She may be... unable to answer the 
		phone...

				CAROLINE'S VOICE
		Her sister's going to do that.  She's 
		as worried as we are.

	A flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face. 
	She closes her eyes for one tight swift moment.

	EXT. HIGHWAY

	We cut again to the highway. The first oncoming headlights 
	slash at the windshield.

	INT. MARY'S NEW CAR

	Cutting back to Mary, we can sense by the tense muscles of 
	her face that she is driving faster. The oncoming headlights 
	blurt at her.

	Suddenly we HEAR Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as 
	if the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break 
	through Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her 
	imagination blank.

				LOWERY'S VOICE
		No! I haven't the faintest idea.  As 
		I said, I last saw your sister when 
		she left this office on Friday... 
		she said she didn't feel well and 
		wanted to leave early and I said she 
		could. And that was the last I saw...
			(a pause, a thought)
		...wait a minute, I did see her, an 
		hour or so later, driving...
			(a pause, then with 
			solemn fear)
		Ah, I think you'd better come over 
		here to my office. Quick.
			(a pause, a click)
		Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.

	EXT. HIGHWAY

	It is completely dark now, night.

	INT. MARY'S NEW CAR

	We cut back to her face.

				LOWERY'S VOICE
		After all, Cassidy, I told you...  
		all that cash... I'm not taking the 
		responsibility... Oh, for heaven's 
		sake, a girl works for you for ten 
		years, you trust her! All right, 
		yes, you better come over.

	FROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT

	EXT. THE ROAD AHEAD INT. MARY'S NEW CAR

	Fast cut back to Mary's face. Oncoming headlights throw a 
	blinding light across her features.

				CASSIDY'S VOICE
			(undrunk, sharp with 
			rage)
		Well I ain't about to kiss off forty 
		thousand dollars! I'll get it back 
		and if any of it's missin' I'll 
		replace it with her fine soft flesh! 
		I'll track her, never you doubt it!

				LOWERY'S VOICE
		Hold on, Cassidy... I still can't 
		believe... it must be some kind of a 
		mystery... I can't...

				CASSIDY'S VOICE
		You checked with the bank, no?  They 
		never laid eyes on her, no?  You 
		still trustin'? Hot creepers, she 
		sat there while I dumped it out... 
		hardly even looked at it, plannin' 
		and... and even flirtin' with me...!

	A look of revulsion makes Mary close her eyes.

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AGAIN

	Big drops of rain begin to appear.

	CLOSEUP - MARY

	She is becoming aware of the rain starting.

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	The rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights.

	CLOSEUP - MARY

	Mary starts the windshield wipers.

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	The wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain.

	CLOSEUP - MARY

	Peering through the blurred windshield.

	CLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS

	slowing down in the flooding highway.

	CLOSEUP - MARY

	peering through the windshield. The oncoming lights are fewer.

	CLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS

	almost coming to a slow turn.

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	just blackness and rain.

	CLOSEUP - MARY

	peering.

	MARY'S VIEWPOINT

	An almost undiscernible light in the far distance, a neon 
	sign blurred by the rain-sheeted windshield.

	MARY'S CAR

	She presses down, forces the car to move on through the 
	flooded road.

	EXT. THE ROAD

	As we move closer, we see the neon sign more clearly and can 
	faintly make out the large letters which read "Motel."  Mary 
	stops the car, lowers the window slightly, looks out. We see 
	the sign clearly now: "BATES MOTEL." Mary opens the car door 
	and dashes out into the rain and up onto the porch of the 
	motel office.

	EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)

	Mary pauses on the porch. The lights are on within the office. 
	She tries door, finds it open, goes into office. CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS her into office. There is no one present. Mary goes 
	to the desk, rings a small pushbell. There is no response. 
	Mary rubs her forehead in weariness and frustration, goes 
	back out onto the porch. She looks off in another direction, 
	slightly behind the office, and sees...

	MARY'S VIEWPOINT - A LARGE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)

	A path from the motel office leads directly up to this house. 
	There is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms. A WOMAN 
	passes the window, pauses, peers out.

	We see her in clear silhouette. She quickly goes away from 
	the window.

	EXT. PORCH OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)

	Mary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get 
	some attention. She stands a few moments, waiting.

	No one comes. Impatience and anger rise in Mary. She dashes 
	out into the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window, 
	begins to honk the horn. After a moment, a YOUNG MAN open 
	the front door of the house, pauses, starts down the path. 
	After a few steps, he turns and runs back into the house. 
	Mary leaves her car, starts a dash for the shelter of the 
	porch. As she runs, we see that the Young Man has gone back 
	only to get an umbrella. Seeing that Mary is on her way to 
	the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his 
	hand. He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached 
	it.

	He stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging 
	useless in his hand, then back to her.

	There is something sadly touching in his manner, in his look. 
	Mary's impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him 
	almost smile. He gestures her into the office, standing back 
	to indicate that he will go after her. She goes into the 
	office.

	INT. OFFICE OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)

	The Young Man follows Mary in, closes the door. He is NORMAN 
	BATES, somewhere in his late twenties, thin and tall, soft-
	spoken and hesitant.

				NORMAN
		Dirty night.

				MARY
			(not really a question)
		You have a vacancy?

				NORMAN
			(simply, almost 
			cheerfully)
		We have twelve vacancies. Twelve 
		cabins, twelve vacancies.
			(a pause)
		They moved away the highway.

				MARY
		I thought I'd gotten off the main...

				NORMAN
		I knew you must have. No one stops 
		here anymore unless they do.

	He is behind the counter now, pushing forward the registration 
	book.

				NORMAN
		But it's no good dwelling on our 
		losses, is it.  We go right ahead 
		lighting signs and following the 
		formalities...  Would you sign, 
		please.

	Mary has placed her handbag on the counter. She takes the 
	registration book, picks up the pen, is suddenly struck with 
	the realization that she'd better use an alias. She writes 
	the name Marie Samuels.

				NORMAN
		Your home address. Oh, just the town 
		will do.

				MARY
			(glancing at newspaper 
			sticking out of her 
			handbag)
		Los Angeles.

	She realizes he didn't ask her to tell him, merely to write 
	it down. She smiles, writes Los Angeles beside the false 
	name. Norman smiles, stops smiling out of embarrassment.

				NORMAN
		Cabin One. It's closer in case you 
		want anything... right next to the 
		office.

	CLOSEUP - NORMAN

	He removes a key for Cabin One. We see that there is a 
	remaining key on the board.

	TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN

				MARY
		I want sleep more than anything.  
		Except maybe, food.

				NORMAN
		There's a big diner about ten miles 
		on up... just outside Fairvale.

				MARY
		Am I that close to Fairvale?

				NORMAN
		Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

	He goes to door, opens it. The rain has slowed down 
	considerably. He smiles at this fact, as if to communicate 
	some pleasure he finds in it. Mary follows him to the door, 
	goes out on the porch, waits and watches as Norman runs to 
	her car, gets in, drives it to the parking space in front of 
	Cabin One. Mary walks along the porch, waits before the door 
	of Cabin One.

	Norman gets out of car, with suitcase, runs to the door, 
	opens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in and switches 
	on a light. Mary goes into the cabin. Norman follows her.

	INT. CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)

	Norman places suitcase on bed, goes to the window, opens it.

				NORMAN
		Stuffy in here.
			(turns to her)
		Well... the mattress is soft and 
		there're hangers in the closet and... 
		stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed 
		on it in case you want to make your 
		friends back home envious... and... 
		the... over there....
			(he points to the 
			bathroom, fairly 
			blushes)

				MARY
		The bathroom.

				NORMAN
			(quickly, starting to 
			leave)
		I'll be in the office if you want 
		anything... just tap on the wall.

				MARY
		Thank you, Mr. Bates.

				NORMAN
		Norman Bates.

	He pauses at the door, gazes at her. She smiles.

				NORMAN
		You have something most girls never 
		have.

				MARY
		I have?

				NORMAN
		There's no name for it... But it's 
		something that, that puts a person 
		at ease.

				MARY
		Thank you. Again.

				NORMAN
			(not really a question)
		You're not going to go out again and 
		drive up to that diner, are you?

				MARY
		No.

				NORMAN
		Then will you do me a favor?
			(without waiting for 
			her response)
		Will you have supper here?  I was 
		just about to, myself... nothing 
		more than some sandwiches and a lot 
		of milk, but I'd like it if you'd 
		come up to the house and... I don't 
		set a fancy table but... the kitchen's 
		awful homey.

				MARY
		I'd like to.

				NORMAN
		All right, you get your dresses 
		hanging out and... change those wet 
		shoes, and I'll come for you soon as 
		it's ready...
			(starts out)
		...with my trusty umbrella.
			(he laughs a small 
			laugh, runs off)

	Mary closes the door, goes to suitcase, opens it, starts to 
	take out a dress. Her handbag is next to the suitcase. She 
	glances down into it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches into 
	the handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at 
	it, almost with regret, filled contemplates hiding it, decides 
	to, starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. She looks 
	about, at the closet, the drawers etc., realizes all such 
	places are obvious. Catching sight of the newspaper in her 
	bag, she hits on a solution. She opens the newspaper, places 
	the envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again and then 
	places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later 
	reading. She considers this for a moment, accepts it, goes 
	to her suitcase to start unpacking.

	Suddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill, ugly sound of 
	a woman's voice, raised in anger.

				WOMAN'S VOICE
		No! I tell you no!

	Mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible 
	voice is coming from the house behind the cabins. CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS her to window and once there we see the light is 
	still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming 
	from that room. The rain has stopped and the moon is out.

				WOMAN'S VOICE
		I won't have you bringing strange 
		young girls in for supper...
			(an ugly, sneering 
			note creeps into the 
			voice)
		...by candlelight, I suppose, in the 
		cheap erotic fashion of young men 
		with cheap, erotic minds!

				NORMAN'S VOICE
		Mother, please...

				WOMAN'S VOICE
		And then what? After supper, music? 
		Whispers?

				NORMAN'S VOICE
		Mother, she's just a stranger...  
		hungry, and the weather's bad...

				WOMAN'S VOICE
			(mimicking cruelly)
		Mother, she's just a stranger!
			(hard, cruel again)
		As if men don't desire strangers, as 
		if... oh, I refuse to speak of 
		disgusting things because they disgust 
		me! You understand, Boy?

				WOMAN'S VOICE
			(pause)
		Go on, go tell her she'll not be 
		appeasing her ugly appetite with my 
		food... or my son! Or do I have to 
		tell her, cause you don't have the 
		guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, 
		boy?

				NORMAN'S VOICE
			(blurted cut fury and 
			shame)
		Shut up! Shut up!

	There is the SOUND of a door closing in that room up there. 
	Mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress 
	and concern and sympathy. She turns her face away now, gazes 
	sadly at the little empty room.

	In a moment there is the SOUND of the house's front door 
	slamming shut. Mary turns, looks out the window.

	FROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT - (NIGHT)

	We see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered 
	tray.

	INT. CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)

	Mary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to 
	the door, opens it and goes out onto the porch.

	EXT. THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)

	Mary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when 
	Norman comes round the building and walks along the porch, 
	past the office, stopping only when he is close to her. He 
	stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her 
	eye.

				MARY
		I've caused you some trouble.

				NORMAN
		Mother...
			(a hollow little laugh, 
			an attempt at sardonic 
			humor)
		...what is the phrase... "she isn't 
		herself today"... I think that's it.

				MARY
			(looking at the tray)
		You shouldn't have bothered. I really 
		don't have that much of an appetite.

	Norman flinches, realizing she has heard his mother's 
	reference to Mary's appetite.

				NORMAN
		I'm sorry. I wish... people could 
		apologize for other people.

				MARY
		Don't worry about it.
			(a warm smile)
		But as long as you've made us supper, 
		we may as well eat it. Huh?

	She begins to back into her room. Norman starts to follow, 
	hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young 
	woman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in 
	defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his 
	defiance for one day. He cannot go into Mary's room.

				NORMAN
		It might be nicer... warmer in the 
		office.

	Without waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns, hurries 
	to the office. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused 
	sympathy, then follows.

	INT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)

	Norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable 
	place to spread out a supper. He turns, sees Mary standing 
	in the doorway.

				NORMAN
		Eating in an office...
			(a rueful smile)
		...to officious, even for me. I have 
		the parlor behind this... if you'd 
		like.

	Mary nods. Norman walks on, behind the counter and into the 
	darkened parlor. Mary follows.

	INT. NORMAN'S PARLOR -(NIGHT)

	In the darkened room, lit only by the light from the office 
	spilling in, we see Norman placing the tray on a table. Mary 
	comes to the doorway, pauses. Norman straightens up, goes to 
	lamp, turns on the light.

	Mary is startled by the room. Even in the dimness of one 
	lamp, the strange, extraordinary nature of the room rushes 
	up at one. It is a room of birds. Stuffed birds, all over 
	the room, on every available surface, one even clinging to 
	the old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp. The birds are 
	of many varieties, beautiful, grand, horrible, preying. Mary 
	stares in awe and a certain fascinated horror.

	CLOSE UP - THE VARIOUS BIRDS TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN

				NORMAN
		Please sit down. On the sofa.

	As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and 
	pouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room. She studies 
	the birds as she walks, briefly examines a bookcase stacked 
	with books on the subject of "Taxidermy."

	CLOSE UP - THE BOOKS ON TAXIDERMY MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARY

	She notices, too, the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily, 
	and many with a vaguely religious overtone.

	Finally Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread.

				MARY
		You're very... kind.

				NORMAN
		It's all for you. I'm not hungry.  
		Please go ahead.

	Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a 
	small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in 
	the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied.

	Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles 
	and then laughs.

				NORMAN
		You eat like a bird.

				MARY
		You'd know, of course.

				NORMAN
		Not really. I hear that expression, 
		that one eats "like a bird," is really 
		a falsie, I mean a falsity, because 
		birds eat a tremendous lot.
			(A pause, then 
			explaining)
		Oh, I don't know anything about birds. 
		My hobby is stuffing things... 
		taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather 
		stuff birds because...  well, I hate 
		the look of beasts when they're 
		stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... 
		some people even stuff dogs and 
		cats... but I can't... I think only 
		birds look well stuffed because 
		they're rather...  passive, to begin 
		with... most of them...

	He trails off, his exuberance failing in the rushing return 
	of his natural hesitancy and discomfort. Mary looks at him, 
	with some compression, smiles.

				MARY
		It's a strange hobby. Curious, I 
		mean.

				NORMAN
		Uncommon, too.

				MARY
		I imagine so.

				NORMAN
		It's not as expensive as you'd think. 
		Cheap, really. Needles, thread, 
		sawdust .. the chemicals are all 
		that cost anything.
			(He goes quiet, looks 
			disturbed)

				MARY
		A man should have a hobby.

				NORMAN
		It's more than a hobby... sometimes... 
		a hobby is supposed to pass the time, 
		not fill it.

				MARY
			(after a pause, softly)
		Is your time so empty?

				NORMAN
		Oh, no!
			(forcing brightness 
			again)
		I run the office, tend the cabins 
		and grounds, do little chores for 
		mother... the ones she allows I might 
		be capable of doing.

				MARY
		You go out... with friends?

				NORMAN
		Friends? Who needs friends.
			(Laughs, then with 
			gallows humor)
		A boy's best friend is his mother.
			(Stops laughing)
		You've never had an empty moment in 
		your whole life. Have you?

				MARY
		Only my share.

				NORMAN
		Where are you going? I don't mean to 
		pry...

				MARY
			(A wistful smile)
		I'm looking for a private island.

				NORMAN
		What are you running away from?

				MARY
			(Alert)
		Why do you ask that?

				NORMAN
		No. People never run away from 
		anything.
			(A pause)
		The rain didn't last very long.
			(Turning suddenly)
		You know what I think? I think we're 
		all in our private traps, clamped in 
		them, and none of us can ever climb 
		out. We scratch and claw... but only 
		at the air, only at each other, and 
		for all of it, we never budge an 
		inch.

				MARY
		Sometimes we deliberately step into 
		those traps.

				NORMAN
		I was born in mine. I don't mind it 
		anymore.

				MARY
		You should... mind it.

				NORMAN
		Oh I do... but I say I don't.
			(Laughs boyishly)

				MARY
			(Staring at him, 
			shaking her head 
			softly.)
		If anyone ever spoke to me, the way 
		I heard... The way she spoke to you, 
		I don't think I could ever laugh 
		again.

				NORMAN
			(Controlled resentment)
		Sometimes when she talks that way to 
		me I'd like to... curse her out and 
		leave her forever!
			(A rueful smile)
		Or at least, defy her.
			(A pause, a hopeless 
			shrug)
		But I couldn't. She's ill.

				MARY
		She sounded strong...

				NORMAN
		I mean... ill.
			(A pause)
		She had to raise me all by herself 
		after my dad died... I was only 
		five... and it must have been a 
		strain. Oh, she didn't have to go 
		out to work or anything, Dad left us 
		with a little something... anyway, a 
		few years ago... Mother met a man. 
		He talked her into building this 
		motel... We could have talked her 
		into anything... and when.  Well... 
		It was just too much for her when he 
		died, too... And the way he died... 
		Oh, it's nothing to talk about when 
		you're eating.
			(Pauses, smiles)
		Anyway, it was too much of a loss 
		for my mother... she had nothing 
		left.

				MARY
			(Critically)
		Except you.

				NORMAN
		A son is a poor substitute for a 
		lover.
			(Turns away as if in 
			distaste of the word)

				MARY
		Why don't you go away?

				NORMAN
		To a private island, like you?

				MARY
		No, not like me.

				NORMAN
		It's too late for me. And besides... 
		who'd look after her? She'd be alone 
		up there, the fire would go out... 
		damp and cold, like a grave. When 
		you love someone, you don't do that 
		to them, even if you hate them. Oh, 
		I don't hate her.  I hate... what 
		she's become. I hate... the illness.

				MARY
			(Slowly, carefully)
		Wouldn't it be better if you put her 
		in... someplace...

	She hesitates. Norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a 
	striking coldness.

				NORMAN
		An Institution? A madhouse?  People 
		always call a madhouse "someplace."
			(Mimicing coldly)
		Put her in Someplace!

				MARY
		I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to 
		sound uncaring...

				NORMAN
			(The coldness turning 
			to tight fury)
		What do you mean about caring?  Have 
		you ever seen one of those places? 
		Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel 
		eyes studying you... and my mother 
		there?  Why? has she harmed you?  
		She's as harmless as... one of these 
		stuffed birds.

				MARY
		I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed 
		she was harming you. I meant...

				NORMAN
			(High fury now)
		Well? You meant well?  People always 
		mean well, they cluck their thick 
		tongues and shake their heads and 
		suggest so very delicately that...

	The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks 
	back into his chair. There is a brief silence.

	Mary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained 
	by his anguish.

				NORMAN
			(Quietly)
		I've suggested it myself. But I hate 
		to even think such a thing.  She 
		needs me... and it isn't...
			(Looks up with a 
			childlike pleading 
			in his eyes)
		...it isn't as if she were a maniac, 
		a raving thing... it's just that... 
		sometimes she goes a little mad. We 
		all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't 
		you?

				MARY
			(After a long 
			thoughtful pause)
		Yes, and just one time can be enough.
			(Rises)
		Thank you.

				NORMAN
			(Cheerfully, correcting)
		Thank you, Norman.

				MARY
		Norman.

				NORMAN
		You're not going to... to your room 
		already?

				MARY
		I'm very tired. And I'll have a long 
		drive tomorrow. All the way back to 
		Phoenix.

				NORMAN
		Phoenix?

				MARY
		I stepped into a private trap back 
		there -- and I want to go back and... 
		try to pull myself out.
			(Looking close at 
			Norman)
		Before it's too late for me, too.

				NORMAN
			(Looking at her)
		Why don't you stay a little while, 
		just for talking.

				MARY
		I'd like to, but...

				NORMAN
		Alright. I'll see you in the morning. 
		I'll bring you breakfast.  What time 
		will you...

				MARY
		Very early. Dawn.

				NORMAN
		Alright, Miss...
			(He has forgotten her 
			name)

				MARY
		Crane.

				NORMAN
		That's it.
			(He frowns, as if 
			bothered by not being 
			able to match the 
			name to the memory 
			of the name in the 
			registration book)

				MARY
		Good night.

	She goes out of the parlor. We see her, from Norman's 
	viewpoint, as she crosses the small office, goes out into 
	the night. Norman turns and looks at the table, and we see 
	his face now. It is bright with that drunken-like look of 
	determination and encouragement and like resolve. He starts 
	to clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of 
	Mary's door in the cabin next door.

	He holds still, listens. He goes into the office and looks 
	at the book.

	C.U. - THE NAME "SAMUELS"

	M.S. - NORMAN

	He goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression. 
	The sound of Mary moving about her room come over, soft 
	SOUNDS, somehow intimate in the night quiet. Norman turns 
	his ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting 
	an impulse to listen, or more than listen.

	But slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and, 
	resisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of 
	his head against it. The SOUNDS come louder, as if we too 
	had our ear pressed against the wall. Now Norman looks at a 
	picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning 
	against. Slowly he starts toward it.

	He reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame 
	off the wall.

	A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the 
	hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is 
	very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light 
	striking Norman's face.

	We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile 
	fills the screen. The tiny spot of light hits his eye. See 
	the small hole through which the light comes. Norman peeps 
	through.

	NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT

	Through the hole we look into Mary's cabin, see Mary 
	undressing. She is in her bra and halfslip. She stoops over 
	a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, begins to 
	unhook her bra.

	NORMAN - ECU

	He watches as Mary removes her bra. We see his eye run up 
	and down the unseen figure of Mary.

	NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT

	Mary, just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity.

	NORMAN

	He turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues 
	turning until he can look out the small parlor window.

	We see, as he sees...

	THE HOUSE IN THE BACKGROUND

	NORMAN

	He turns his face away, quickly, resentfully. In his face we 
	see anger and anguish. And then resolve.

	Quickly, precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in 
	the wall, turns, starts out of the parlor. We see him go 
	through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering 
	to close the door behind him.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. THE MOTEL OFFICE PORCH - (NIGHT)

	Norman walking along the porch, in the direction of the big 
	house. Once on the path he pauses, looks up at the light in 
	the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his 
	shoulders, strides manfully up the path.

	CAMERA follows behind him. He opens the door of the house, 
	enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, look 
	up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He 
	holds for a moment, and then his resolve and courage 
	evaporates. His shoulders slump, sadly, mournfully. He by-
	passes the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen. 
	At the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen, drops 
	wearily into a chair. After a moment, he stretches out a leg 
	and gently pushes the kitchen door closed.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. MARY'S MOTEL ROOM - (NIGHT)

	Mary is seated at the small desk, engrossed in figuring in a 
	small notebook. We see from these figures a calculation which 
	indicates her intention to make a restitution of the money 
	she has used of the forty thousand dollars. We see, too, her 
	bankbook. The paper reads thus: top figure, 40,000; directly 
	beneath it 500, the amount used for the new car; total after 
	subtraction, 39,500. In another spot we see a figure which 
	matches the balance in her bankbook; 624.00.

	Beneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after 
	subtraction, 124.00. She studies the figures, sighs, not 
	wearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure 
	that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to 
	continue doing the right thing. After a moment she tears the 
	page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into 
	small pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces 
	into the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet. Then she drops her 
	robe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on.

	INT. MARY IN SHOWER

	Over the bar on which hangs the shower curtain, we can see 
	the bathroom door, not entirely closed. For a moment we watch 
	Mary as she washes and soaps herself.

	There is still a small worry in her eyes, but generally she 
	looks somewhat relieved.

	Now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open.

	The noise of the shower drowns out any sound. The door is 
	then slowly and carefully closed.

	And we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower 
	curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. The white 
	brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding.

	Suddenly we see the hand reach up, grasp the shower curtain, 
	rip it aside.

							 CUT TO:

	MARY - ECU

	As she turns in response to the feel and SOUND of the shower 
	curtain being torn aside. A look of pure horror erupts in 
	her face. A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her 
	throat. A hand comes into the shot. The hand holds an enormous 
	bread knife. The flint of the blade shatters the screen to 
	an almost total, silver blankness.

	THE SLASHING

	An impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very 
	screen, ripping the film. Over it the brief gulps of 
	screaming. And then silence. And then the dreadful thump as 
	Mary's body falls in the tub.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	The blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand 
	pulling the shower curtain back. We catch one flicker of a 
	glimpse of the murderer. A woman, her face contorted with 
	madness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a 
	fright-wig.  And then we see only the curtain, closed across 
	the tub, and hear the rush of the shower water. Above the 
	shower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a 
	moment we HEAR the SOUND of the front door slamming.

							 CUT TO:

	THE DEAD BODY

	Lying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over, 
	touching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if 
	popped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor.  
	Coming down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along 
	the porcelain, we see many small threads of blood. CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the 
	bathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom. As CAMERA 
	approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed 
	it on the bedside table.

	CLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER

	beside the bed. The CAMERA now moves away over to the window 
	and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, 
	coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, 
	shocked voice.

				NORMAN'S VOICE
		Mother! Oh God, what... blood, 
		blood... mother...!

	We cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations.

	After a moment or two of silence, Norman emerges from the 
	front door, dashes down the path toward the motel.

						QUICK CUT TO:

	EXT. THE PATH - (NIGHT)

	Norman is coming AT CAMERA, running head-on. He dashes into 
	an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in 
	his face. CAMERA PANS as Norman races past, holds as Norman 
	runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Mary's 
	room.

	INT. MARY'S CABIN - (NIGHT)

	Norman pauses a moment in the doorway, glances about the 
	room, hears the shower going, sees the bathroom door is open. 
	He goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body.

	Slowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face, 
	covers his eyes, turns his face away. Then he crosses to the 
	window, looks out at the house. Shot is so angled that we 
	see the bedside table with the newspaper on it.

	After a moment, Norman moves from the window, sinks onto the 
	edge of the bed.

	FRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN

	Norman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot. We can 
	see only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile 
	floor. Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of 
	his dilemma. Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the 
	peace that comes with decision.

	Norman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with 
	resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across 
	it. Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch, 
	and draws those curtains closed. Then he switches off the 
	bedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from 
	the bathroom. He opens the front door, goes out.

	EXT. THE HOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)

	Norman comes out of Mary's cabin, closes the door carefully 
	behind him, goes along the porch to his office, goes in. We 
	stay outside. Immediately, the "Vacancy" sign goes off, and 
	then the motel sign goes off. As CAMERA GOES closer to the 
	office, the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door 
	opening and then the SOUND of a pail being picked up. Norman 
	comes out of office, closes door, looks cautiously about, 
	goes along porch, carrying pail with mop in it, goes into 
	Mary's cabin, closing the door after him.

	INT. MARY'S CABIN

	With the paper in the foreground, Norman enters. We can see 
	him in the dim spill of light. He pauses by the door, then 
	gathers his strength and goes into the bathroom. We HEAR him 
	set the pail on the tiled floor, and then we HEAR the shower 
	being turned off. And there is total silence. CAMERA MOVES 
	FORWARD so that we can see into bathroom.

	CAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up. 
	Quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges 
	with it into the bedroom. CAMERA PANS down and we see him 
	spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside 
	the bathroom door. He spreads the curtain so that one end of 
	it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over 
	and onto the tile floor. Again he goes into the bathroom and 
	CAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman. 
	He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his 
	body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it 
	across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain 
	in the bedroom. Having arranged the body, he straightens up, 
	examines his hands, sees bloodstains on them. He returns to 
	the bathroom, goes to the hand-basin.

	CLOSE SHOT

	We see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being 
	diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water.

	NORMAN

	We see Norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn 
	to the job of cleaning the bathroom.

	He places the pail in the tub, runs water into it, dips the 
	mop in, swabs the tile floor. With a towel he wipes off the 
	wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and 
	even the shower curtain rod. Then he takes a second towel 
	and goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them.  
	Finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail, 
	cleans out the tub, and goes out into the bedroom.

	INT. MARY'S BEDROOM

	Norman steps carefully around the unseen body, crosses to 
	the desk, starts going through Mary's handbag, in search of 
	her car keys. He suddenly notices them lying on the desk, 
	where he'd thrown them after parking her car. He picks up 
	the keys, crosses the room, goes out.

	EXT. THE PORCH

	We see Norman pauses at the door, check cautiously, then 
	hurry across the porch and into Mary's car. He circle-turns 
	the car, so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch, 
	directly opposite Mary's door, as close as it can go.

	Then he alights, goes to the trunk, opens it with the key 
	and, leaving the trunk lid raised, goes back into the cabin.

	INT. MARY'S ROOM

	From a raised angle, we see Norman bend down and begin to 
	wrap the shower curtain around the body. We see the edges of 
	the curtain as they are raised and laid down again. Then he 
	picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his 
	foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind 
	him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body 
	in the trunk. He closes the lid then, but does not lock it. 
	He comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely, 
	flicks on the light.

	Again the newspaper is in the foreground. For a moment he 
	pauses, closes his eyes against the realization of what he 
	is doing, then quickly pushes all thoughts away, continues 
	with his work. With the room lighted, he now proceeds to 
	gather up all Mary's articles and toss them into the suitcase. 
	He checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks 
	under bed and bureau, goes into the bathroom, checks that 
	room again, comes back into the bedroom, looks about 
	carefully, spots Mary's handbag, throws even that into the 
	suitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl 
	are gone from the room. Then he closes Mary's suitcase, picks 
	it up.

	With his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the 
	mop and the used towels. He crosses to the door, switches 
	off the light with his shoulder, pulls open the door, starts 
	out.

	EXT. THE PORCH

	As Norman stands in the doorway, he is suddenly and blindingly 
	lit by the bright headlights of a passing car. The flash of 
	the lights and the SOUND of the SPEEDING CAR are over in a 
	flicker of a moment, but it takes a few seconds for Norman 
	to regain his former tense composure. Then he goes to the 
	car trunk, raises it with his foot, throws the suitcase and 
	the pail into it, slams it shut. He pauses a moment, then 
	realizes he has left the bathroom light on in Mary's cabin. 
	He returns to cabin. As he enters, his eye is caught by the 
	newspaper on the bedside table. He goes to it, takes the 
	newspaper, and looks once again into the bathroom. His glance 
	goes right over the toilet bowl.

	He turns out the lights, crosses the darkened cabin, goes 
	out onto the porch.

	He reopens the trunk, tosses in the newspaper and closes it. 
	He goes around and jumps into the car and starts away.

	We HOLD on the trunk, follow it for a while, then

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)

	The car pulls away from a CLOSE ANGLE on the trunk and as 
	CAMERA HOLDS we see that we are now in a swamp area.

	It is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects. 
	Norman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp, turns 
	off the lights, gets out, leaving door open. He looks at the 
	swamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car, 
	realizes he has no choice. He leans into the car, releases 
	the emergency brake, starts to push. The front of the car 
	begins to roll into the swamp. Suddenly there is the LOW, 
	THROBBING SOUND of a motor. Norman freezes, listens.

	The SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane 
	flying overhead. The car is rolling quickly now. Norman jumps 
	away, slams the door shut, stands tense. The SOUND of the 
	plane overhead grows louder.

	Norman looks up.

	NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT - THE BLACK SKY

	We see no plane. The SOUND of the motor is beginning to 
	diminish.

						 CUT BACK TO:

	NORMAN

	We see the relief in his face. He looks at the car.

	More than two-thirds of it have already sunk into the swamp. 
	The trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime, 
	as if refusing to go the rest of the way. Norman begins to 
	panic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot. And 
	slowly the car sinks, until finally it is gone and we hear 
	only the gentle plop of the swamp's final gulp, and see only 
	the small after-bubble, like a visual burp.

	Norman waits a moment, then begins stamping out the tire 
	marks, so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp.

	He stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we:

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	CLOSE UP NORMAN

	standing on the porch of the motel, leaning against a post. 
	He is staring out into the night, a look of guarded, casual 
	innocence on his face, as if he were taking one last moment 
	of peaceful night air before retiring. Then he glances down 
	and CAMERA follows his gaze. A hose is lying on the ground 
	outside Mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the 
	tire marks.

	After a moment, Norman's hand comes into shot, picks up hose, 
	places it in a new position. As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see 
	that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the 
	road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a 
	car had been parked here.

	After a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it 
	off, unscrews the hose. As he rolls the hose, he walks away 
	from the spot, past the office, heading for the path that 
	leads to the house. He goes up the path, pauses at the steps 
	of the house, tosses the curled hose onto the lawn, goes up 
	the steps and into the house. CAMERA FOLLOWS him in, PAUSES 
	as he pauses at the foot of the stairs. Norman goes up the 
	stairs.

	On the landing he stops. The door to his mother's room is 
	closed. Lying in a heap outside the door are a blood-stained 
	dress and a pair of elderly-woman's shoes. From an EXTREMELY 
	HIGH ANGLE, we look down on Norman as he bends to pick up 
	the stained dress and shoes.

	He rolls the shoes into the dress, tucks the small, neat 
	bundle under his arm, and starts down the stairs, heading 
	for the basement.

	EXT. A LONG SHOT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)

	It stands silhouetted against the sky. There is a long wait. 
	Then, slowly, a curl of smoke comes out of the chimney.

							 FADE OUT:

							 FADE IN

	INT. BACK ROOM OF SAM'S HARDWARE STORE IN FAIRVALE - (DAY)

	Sam is seated at his desk, writing a letter. Sequence

	begins with CAMERA IN CLOSE, over Sam's shoulder, and we can 
	read as mush as he has written of the letter. The letterhead 
	reads "Sam Loomis - Hardware," and the letter reads: "Dearest 
	right-as-always Mary: I'm sitting in this tiny back room 
	which isn't big enough for both of us, and suddenly it looks 
	big enough for both of us. So what if we're poor and cramped 
	and miserable, at least we'll be happy! If you haven't come 
	to your senses, and still want to...

	CAMERA begins PULLING AWAY as Sam turns the sheet of paper 
	over, continues backing away out of the small back room and 
	heads, backwards, down the corridor, we see a young clerk, 
	BOB SUMMERFIELD, Sam's assistant, standing behind the counter, 
	a look of handsome patience on his face. He is waiting on a 
	meticulous, elderly woman customer, who is holding and 
	examining a large can of insecticide. As CAMERA PASSES:

				WOMAN CUSTOMER
		...They tell you what its ingredients 
		are and how it's guaranteed to 
		exterminate any insect in the world, 
		but they do not tell you whether or 
		not it's painless. And I say insect 
		or man, death should always be 
		painless.

	CAMERA, by this has reached the front door of the hardware 
	store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door. 
	She is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a 
	look of purposefulness. She carries a handbag and a small 
	overnight case. She is Mary's sister, LILA CRANE.

	Bob Summerfield has noticed Lila, smiles brightly at her, 
	gives her an I'll-be-with-you-in-a-moment nod.

	Lila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her 
	eyes off Bob. As she approaches, she asks quietly:

				LILA
		Sam?

				SUMMERFIELD
		You want to see Sam?

				LILA
		Sam Loomis.

				SUMMERFIELD
			(yelling toward back 
			room)
		Sam! Lady wants to see you!

	Lila looks to the back room. The woman customer goes on 
	worriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can. 
	Sam comes to the door of his room, pauses, looks at Lila a 
	moment, starts toward her, his expression indicating that he 
	does not know her. Lila studies him with a quiet, worried 
	expression.

				SAM
		Yes?

				LILA
		May I talk to you?

				SAM
			(a bit mystified)
		Sure...

	Lila glances at the customer and the clerk, turns, starts 
	toward the front of the store. Sam holds a moment, then 
	follows. As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him 
	intently as she says:

				LILA
		I'm Mary's sister.

				SAM
		Lila.

				LILA
			(quickly)
		Is Mary here?

	Sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile 
	expression on Lila's face. He studies her for a quiet moment. 
	Behind them is a display of various size carving knives.

				SAM
		Is something wrong?

				LILA
		I want to know if my sister is here.

				SAM
		Here?

				LILA
		With you.

				SAM
		Where?

				LILA
		I don't know where. In your store, 
		somewhere in your town... anywhere.

				SAM
		What's the matter?

				LILA
		Don't you know?

	As Sam is about to speak, the Woman Customer comes sailing 
	past, speaking as she goes and wearing a satisfied smile.

				WOMAN CUSTOMER
		All I can do is hope if it isn't 
		painless, it's quick!

	She speaks "quick" with a kind of delicious bite, nods 
	happily, goes on out of the store. Sam is now staring 
	apprehensively at Lila.

				SAM
		What should I know?

				LILA
		To begin with, where Mary is. Do 
		you?

				SAM
		No. I take it you don't either?
			(As Lila shakes her 
			head)
		How long?

				LILA
		Last Friday. She left work, and 
		home... I was in Tucson over the 
		weekend... I haven't heard from her, 
		not even a phone call.

				SAM
		And you thought she'd come up here, 
		to me? If she had, what reason would 
		she have for not calling you?

				LILA
		A good reason, I suppose.

				SAM
			(Slightly exasperated)
		Well what do you think, we eloped or 
		something? Or we're living in sin 
		and...

				LILA
		Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being 
		defensive that you haven't even 
		reacted to the most serious fact of 
		all. Mary is missing.

				SAM
		I was getting to that!

				LILA
		What do you know about it?

				SAM
		Nothing! You're putting me on the 
		defensive.

				LILA
		Look, if you two are in this thing 
		together, I don't care, it's none of 
		my business... But I want to see 
		Mary. I want her to tell me she's 
		all right and it's none of my 
		business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix 
		and...

	She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes 
	beginning to fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a 
	moment, then turns and calls:

				SAM
		Bob? Run out and get yourself some 
		lunch.

				SUMMERFIELD
		It's okay, Sam, I brought it with 
		me.

				SAM
		Run out and eat it.

	Bob gets the message, goes out through the back way.

	Sam goes closer to Lila, speaks with soft seriousness.

				SAM
		What thing?

				LILA
		Huh?

				SAM
		What thing could we be in together?

				LILA
			(A pause)
		I hate tears.
			(Takes out hankie)

				SAM
		Is Mary... in trouble?

				LILA
		Yes.

				SAM
		Well why didn't she come to me...  
		call me...?

				LILA
		Not that kind...
			(Almost a smile)
		You men and your egos.

				SAM
			(Seriously)
		Never mind my ego. Let's talk about 
		Mary.

	Their attention is distracted by a man who has strolled 
	quietly into the room. He ignores them, walks past them, 
	goes behind the counter, takes down a sign reading "CLOSED 
	FOR LUNCH," walks back to the door, closes door, hangs the 
	sign across the door window, locks the door, turns to Sam 
	and Lila, folds his arms, smiles a particularly unfriendly 
	smile.

				ARBOGAST
		Let's all talk about Mary.

				SAM
		Who are you, friend?

				ARBOGAST
		Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.
			(To Lila)
		Where is she, Miss Crane?

				LILA
		I don't know.

				ARBOGAST
		Wouldn't have been able to tail you 
		if you did.

				SAM
		What's your interest?

				ARBOGAST
		Money.

	There is a moment's silence and then, unable to tolerate the 
	sudden frightening happenings, Sam explodes.

				SAM
		Somebody better tell me what's going 
		on and tell me fast! I can take so 
		much and then...

				ARBOGAST
			(Interrupting calmly)
		Your girl friend stole forty thousand 
		dollars.

	Sam looks at Arbogast in utter shock and in that state asks 
	one of those seemingly ridiculous questions.

				SAM
		Why?

				ARBOGAST
			(An almost amused 
			smile)
		Must've needed it.

				SAM
		What are you talking about?
			(To Lila)
		What is this?

				LILA
		She was supposed to bank it, on 
		Friday, for her boss. She didn't.

	And no one has seen her since.

				ARBOGAST
			(Looking at Sam)
		Someone has seen her. Someone always 
		sees a girl with forty thousand 
		dollars.
			(To Sam)
		She is your girl friend, isn't she?

				LILA
		Sam, they don't want to prosecute, 
		they just want the money back. It 
		was all in cash...

				ARBOGAST
			(Correcting with 
			Cassidy's word)
		Casharoonie!

				LILA
		Sam, if she's here...

				SAM
		She isn't!

	A real look of anguish comes into Lila's face. And Arbogast 
	studies it, then speaks.

				ARBOGAST
		You came up here on a hunch, Miss 
		Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... 
		from him, or from your sister herself?

				LILA
			(wearily)
		Not even a hunch. Just hope.

				ARBOGAST
		With a little checking, I could get 
		to believe you.

				LILA
			(anxiously)
		I don't care if you do or... I want 
		to see Mary... before she gets in 
		any deeper...

				SAM
		Did you check in Phoenix... 
		hospitals... maybe she had an 
		accident... a hold-up...

				ARBOGAST
		She was seen leaving town in her 
		car. Seen by her very victims, I 
		might add.

				SAM
			(after a moment)
		I don't believe it.
			(to Lila, slowly)
		Do you?

				LILA
			(a thoughtful pause)
		Yes... I just... did. The moment 
		they told me...

				SAM
		You might have doubted for say five 
		minutes or so, Sister.

	Lila turns from Sam, a flush of guilt and regret in her face. 
	Arbogast looks at her, quiet sympathetically.

				ARBOGAST
		We're always quickest to doubt people 
		who have a record for being honest.  
		I think she's here, Miss Crane. Where 
		there's a boyfriend...
			(Trails off, smiles 
			encouragingly)
		She won't be back there among the 
		nuts and bolts... but she'll be in 
		this town... somewhere. I'll find 
		her.

	He nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, sails it to 
	the counter, opens door, goes out into the street.

	After a quiet moment:

				LILA
		I just listened... and believed 
		everything they told me. 'She stole 
		the money.' 'We don't want to get 
		her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the 
		police in'...

				SAM
		It was her boss' idea not to report 
		it to the police?

				LILA
		No. The man whose money she... he 
		talked so loud and fast, and I... I 
		should've called the police.

				SAM
		He must have had a darn good reason 
		for wanting them kept out of it...  
		All that cash...

				LILA
		I ought to call the police right 
		now!

				SAM
		No.

				LILA
		Why not? Sam, is she hiding here?  
		Are you two planning to go away with 
		the money?

				SAM
		How could I go away? I'm in debt up 
		to my...
			(Smiles at the 
			incongruity of his 
			reply, then goes 
			serious)
		If she did steal that money...  It's 
		hard to believe she did because it's 
		hard to see why she would. Unless 
		she had some wild idea that it would 
		help me... us...

				LILA
		She haven't even called you?

				SAM
		I didn't see her... and I didn't 
		hear from her! Believe that!

				LILA
		I need to... I need to believe 
		something. This is the first time 
		I've ever come up against anything I 
		couldn't... understand.

				SAM
		You've led a charmed life.

				LILA
		No. I just think... anything can be 
		explained. But Mary, doing a thing 
		like this... I don't know how to 
		handle...

				SAM
		Maybe we can handle it together.
			(He smiles 
			encouragingly)

				LILA
			(A rueful shrug)
		I came flying up here expecting to 
		get some explanation... for all I 
		know, she may be trying to get in 
		touch with me, at home. I'd better 
		go home.

				SAM
			(A thoughtful pause)
		I think she'll contact me if she 
		contacts anybody. Why don't you stay 
		here. When she shows up... or calls... 
		be here.

				LILA
			(A long study, her 
			suspicion of him 
			evaporating)
		You want me to stay here?

				SAM
		She'll need both of us.

				LILA
			(considers, then:)
		Where... can I stay?

				SAM
			(brightly)
		First rate hotel, fifty yards up the 
		street. Come on.
			(as he reaches for 
			the closed-for-lunch 
			sign)
		After we check you in we'll go to 
		the drugstore and get you a sandwich. 
		Then we'll come back here... and 
		wait.

	He hangs the sign on the door, ushers Lila out, closes door 
	behind him.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - (DAY)

	They emerge from the store and walk along to the hotel.  As 
	they enter, Arbogast is in the act of taking over a white 
	Ford sedan from a rental car man. They glance at him and he 
	returns a cynical look.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HOTEL - (DAY)

	Outside another hotel we see Arbogast alight from the white 
	car and go into new hotel.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - (DAY)

	The white car speeding along the highway.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. NEW MOTEL - (DAY)

	Arbogast going into the office - we see the sign above him.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)

	A high shot showing the freeway and Bates house and motel on 
	the side old highway. A pause and then across the bottom of 
	the picture a white car speeds by on the freeway.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HOTEL - (DUSK)

	Another Hotel. Arbogast goes in.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)

	The white car speeding along the freeway again going in the 
	opposite direction to last time. Norman, a tiny figure, is 
	seen going up the steps to his mother's house.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - (DAY)

	Arbogast's search is getting down in the scale. This is an 
	entrance to a cheesy boarding house. "Rooms to Rent," etc. 
	He looks at his list and then goes in.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)

	The white car goes by on the freeway again.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - (DAY)

	Arbogast goes in.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (TWILIGHT)

	Heavy traffic on the freeway. A beat or two - again the white 
	car. It slows up opposite the distant motel. It makes a turn 
	and goes back out of scene. A pause and it reappears on the 
	old road and slowly makes its way toward the Bates' Motel.

	EXT. THE BATES' HOUSE AND MOTEL - (TWILIGHT)

	We now see Norman. He has brought out an old rocking chair 
	and has placed it on the office porch and is sitting hunched 
	in it. And he is darning one of his own socks. CAMERA HOLDS. 
	Beyond the porch, and Norman, we see the old house and can 
	barely make out, in the twilight dimness, the figure of his 
	mother seated at the window. Here, too, there is that quality 
	of quiet peace surrounded by a vague foreboding.

	Now Norman looks up at the SOUND of the approaching car.

	And continues looking as the car comes to a stop and Arbogast 
	gets out. Arbogast gives the place a quick once-over, gazes 
	at Norman, starts forward. In his steps and manner there is 
	that bored, routine-logged quality of a man who has seen too 
	many motels and asked question of too many hotel managers 
	over too short a period of time.

	Norman rises as Arbogast comes forward.

				NORMAN
			(shoving sock in his 
			pocket)
		I always forget to put the sign on, 
		but we do have vacancy.
			(Cheerfully)
		Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve 
		vacancies.

				ARBOGAST
			(pleasantly)
		In the past two days I've been to so 
		many motels, my eyes are bleary with 
		neon. This is the first one that 
		looked like it was hiding from the 
		world at large.

				NORMAN
		I don't really forget the sign, it 
		just doesn't seem... any use.
			(Points)
		This used to be the main highway.
			(Starts for office)
		Want to register, please?

				ARBOGAST
		Sit down. I don't want to trouble 
		you, just want to ask...

				NORMAN
		No trouble. Today's linen day. I 
		change all the beds once a week, 
		whether they've been used or not... 
		dampness. I hate the smell of 
		dampness.
			(Opening office door)
		It's such a dank smell.

	Norman is holding the door open, so Arbogast walks in.

	Norman follows.

	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - (TWILIGHT)

	Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen 
	closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has 
	remained standing by the door.

				NORMAN
		You out to buy a motel?

				ARBOGAST
		No.

				NORMAN
		Oh. I thought... you said you'd been 
		to so many in two days...  What was 
		it you wanted to ask?

				ARBOGAST
		I'm looking for a missing person.
			(takes out and opens 
			wallet and extends 
			it as he speaks)
		My name's Arbogast, private 
		investigator...
			(takes back wallet 
			when Norman doesn't 
			look at it)
		Trying to trace a young girl who's 
		been missing almost a week. From 
		Phoenix.
			(A look at Norman's 
			frightened expression)
		It's a private matter... family wants 
		to forgive her...
			(smiles)
		She isn't in trouble.

				NORMAN
			(forcing a smile)
		I didn't think the police went 
		searching for people who weren't in 
		trouble.

				ARBOGAST
		I'm not the police.

				NORMAN
		Oh.

	He waits a moment, then opens closet, starts counting out 
	sheets and pillow cases, keeps his back to Arbogast.

	Arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talks as he 
	crosses to Norman.

				ARBOGAST
		We have reason to believe she came 
		this way... might have stopped in 
		this area...
			(extends photograph, 
			which Norman doesn't 
			glance at)
		Did she stop here?

				NORMAN
		No. No one has stopped here in 
		weeks...

				ARBOGAST
		Mind looking at the picture before 
		committing yourself?

				NORMAN
		Committing myself to what? You sure 
		talk like a Policeman.

				ARBOGAST
		Look at the picture. Please.

	Norman glances, briefly, turns away, lifts sheets and pillow 
	cases off the shelf holds them close, almost protectively.

				NORMAN
		No. At least I don't recall.

				ARBOGAST
		She might have used an alias. Mary 
		Crane's the real name, but she 
		might've registered...

				NORMAN
			(interrupting)
		I don't even bother with guests 
		registering any more... I mean, little 
		by little, you drop the formalities.
			(more relaxed, because 
			Arbogast is listening 
			with a pleasant smile)
		I shouldn't even bother to change 
		the linen. I guess habits die hard. 
		Which reminds me...

	He goes to the wall, flips a light switch.

				NORMAN
		The vacancy sign. Just in case.

	We had a couple the other night, said if the sign hasn't 
	been on they'd have thought this was an old deserted mining 
	town or something.

				ARBOGAST
		Now there's a couple even remarking 
		about your sign, and see how easily 
		you forgot them?

				NORMAN
		What?

				ARBOGAST
		You thought no one has stopped here 
		in weeks. Now, try to remember if 
		this girl...

				ARBOGAST
			(A pause, a study)
		Maybe she even signed the register... 
		because habits die hard. Let's check 
		it, huh?

	Norman says nothing. Arbogast goes to the desk, pulls the 
	registry book around, flips back a page or two.

	Norman simply stares at the man. Arbogast hums faintly, 
	pleasantly, as he examines the pages. Then:

				ARBOGAST
		Yes sir! Marie Samuels.  Interesting 
		alias.

	He takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside 
	the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding 
	and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as 
	happy as it is making him.

				ARBOGAST
		Don't know where she got "Marie," 
		but "Samuels" figures. Her boy 
		friend's name is Sam.
			(Turns to Norman, the 
			smile gone)
		Was she in disguise? Or do you want 
		to check the picture again?

				NORMAN
		I didn't lie to you. I just have 
		trouble keeping track of... time.

	Arbogast has reached him, the picture extended. Norman looks 
	dutifully at it.

				NORMAN
		It was raining and her hair didn't 
		look like that... damped out, I guess.

				ARBOGAST
		Tell me all about her.

				NORMAN
		She arrived kind of late, wet and 
		hungry and she was very tired and 
		went right to bed and left early.

				ARBOGAST
		How early?

				NORMAN
		Very early. Dawn.

				ARBOGAST
		Of which morning?

				NORMAN
		The following morning. Sunday.

				ARBOGAST
		No one met her?

				NORMAN
		No.

				ARBOGAST
		Or arrived with her.

				NORMAN
		No.

				ARBOGAST
		She didn't call anyone? Even locally?

				NORMAN
		No.

				ARBOGAST
		You didn't spend the whole night 
		with her did you?

				NORMAN
		No! Of all...

				ARBOGAST
		How do you know she didn't make a 
		call?

				NORMAN
		She was tired. She said she had a 
		long drive ahead of her, in the 
		morning... Yes, now I'm remembering 
		very clearly because I'm picturing. 
		When you make a picture of the moment 
		in your mind, you can remember every 
		detail. She was sitting back there, 
		no she was standing up, with some 
		sandwich still in her hand, and she 
		said she had to drive a long way.

				ARBOGAST
		Back where?

				NORMAN
		What do you mean?

				ARBOGAST
		You said she was sitting "back there," 
		or standing rather...

				NORMAN
		Oh. My private parlor. She had an 
		awful hunger... so I made her some 
		supper. And then she went to bed and 
		left in the morning. I didn't even 
		see her leave.

				ARBOGAST
		How did she pay you?

				NORMAN
		What?

				ARBOGAST
		Cash or check? For the cabin...

				NORMAN
		Cash.

				ARBOGAST
		And when she left, she never came 
		back.

				NORMAN
		Why should she? I'm sorry, I have 
		work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...

				ARBOGAST
		I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't 
		aspic!
			(smiles)
		This ain't jelling.

				NORMAN
		I don't know what you expect me to 
		know about... people come and go...

				ARBOGAST
		She isn't still here, is she?

				NORMAN
		Not at all!

				ARBOGAST
		Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, 
		all twelve... would I need a warrant?

				NORMAN
			(as if pleasantly 
			exasperated)
		Look, if you won't believe me, go 
		ahead. You can help me make beds if 
		you like.
			(laughs, shakes his 
			head)
		Come on.

	He starts out. Arbogast pauses, momentarily confused by the 
	young man's openness.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)

	Norman walks down the porch, hesitates before Cabin One, 
	walks on a bit toward Cabin Two, stops, turns to see if 
	Arbogast is following. Arbogast has come out onto the porch, 
	but is not following. He has walked to the opposite end of 
	the porch and is standing at its edge, looking up at the old 
	house. The upstairs window is in darkness. The neon of the 
	Vacancy and Motel signs splash strange light over the scene.

				NORMAN
		Change your mind?

	Arbogast does not reply. Norman becomes apprehensive, starts 
	to Arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful.

				NORMAN
		I guess I've got one of those faces 
		you can't help believing.

				ARBOGAST
			(to Norman, but 
			continuing to stare 
			at the house)
		Anyone at home?

				NORMAN
		I live there. Alone.

				ARBOGAST
		Someone is sitting in that window.

				NORMAN
		My mother.

	Arbogast turns, gazes seriously at him.

				NORMAN
		She's... ill. Confined to her room. 
		It's practically living alone.

				ARBOGAST
			(after a pause)
		If this girl Mary Crane were here, 
		you'd have no reason to hide her 
		would you?

				NORMAN
		Of course not.

				ARBOGAST
		If she paid you well?

				NORMAN
		Now, look...!

				ARBOGAST
		Or if she had you say... gallantly 
		protecting her... you wouldn't be 
		fooled... you'd know she was just 
		using you. Wouldn't you?

				NORMAN
		I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable 
		of being fooled! Not even by women!

				ARBOGAST
		I didn't mean that as a slur on your 
		manhood. I'm sorry.

				NORMAN
			(disturbed now)
		That's all right. maybe she could 
		have fooled me.  But...
			(a rueful smile)
		She didn't fool my mother.

				ARBOGAST
		Your mother met her?
			(quickly)
		Can I talk to your mother?

				NORMAN
		No. I told you, she's confined...

				ARBOGAST
		Just for a moment. She might have 
		picked up a hint you'd miss.

				ARBOGAST
		Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I 
		won't disturb...

				NORMAN
		No! Just no!  I have one of those 
		breaking points like any other man, 
		believe it or not, and I'm near it.
		There's just so much pushing I can 
		take and I think...

				ARBOGAST
		All right!
			(starts away, toward 
			his car, pauses)
		Might save me a lot of leg-work if I 
		could just talk to your mother.  But 
		I'd need a warrant for that, won't 
		I?

	Norman does not respond. Arbogast gets in his car, starts 
	the motor. Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own 
	face showing apprehension. Arbogast backs the car around 
	very slowly, his gaze divided between the old house and the 
	lighted window of Cabin Two. As he turns the car out, his 
	headlights light up the porch.

	Norman stands, watching him drive away.

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT)

	The car pulls up and Arbogast gets out of car, leaving motor 
	running. As he starts to walk across the highway, CAMERA 
	PULLS AWAY and we

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY WITH TELEPHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT)

	Arbogast gets to the phone booth, enters. CAMERA STARTS 
	FORWARD, and we see Arbogast remove a small notebook from 
	his pocket, check on a number, drop a dime in the slot and 
	dial this number. As we reach phone booth,

							 CUT TO:

				ARBOGAST
			(into phone)
		Miss Crane, please.
			(listens)
		She leave a number?
			(listens)
		Thanks.
			(hangs up, dials again, 
			waits)
		Lila there, Mr. Loomis? Arbogast.
			(waits)
		Lila? Look, this isn't much, but it 
		might make you feel a little better. 
		Mary was up here. Spent last Saturday 
		night at Bates'  Motel, out here on 
		the old highway.
			(listens)
		Young fellow runs it, said Mary spent 
		the night, left, period!
			(listens)
		I did question him, believe me. I 
		think I got all there was to get.  
		Just have to try to pick up the scent 
		from here.
			(listens)
		Well... maybe that's because I don't 
		feel entirely satisfied.  He's got a 
		sick old mother, confined type, and 
		I think she saw Mary and talked to 
		her. Shame, too... confined old women 
		love to talk to strangers.
			(listens)
		I was, but I think I'll go back to 
		the motel, first.
			(listens)
		No, you stay put, Lila. With Loomis. 
		I should be back in an hour.
			(listens)
		All right. And Lila... You'll be 
		happy to know what I think. I think 
		our friend Sam Loomis didn't even 
		know Mary was here.
			(smiles)
		See you in an hour. Or less.

	He hangs up, gets out of the phone booth.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)

	A distant view of the House and Motel. There is a light on 
	in the house. There is also a light on in Norman's office. 
	We see Norman emerge from his office and move along the porch 
	toward the distant cabins. He carries sheets on his arm. He 
	goes into the last cabin and switches the light on. Into the 
	foreground the hood of the white Ford enters the scene and 
	stops. Arbogast gets out. He goes over to the Motel office.

	EXT. MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)

	Arbogast goes in.

	INT. OFFICE - (NIGHT)

	Arbogast looks around the empty office and calls.

				ARBOGAST
		Bates!

	He goes over to the door to the parlor and enters. He looks 
	around the bird-ridden room. He stops short as he sees:

	C.U. - THE OLD SAFE IN THE CORNER

	C.U. - ARBOGAST

	goes over to it. He finds it unlocked. With a quick, cautious 
	look around he opens it.

	C.U. - THE EMPTY SAFE

	C.U. - ARBOGAST

	straightens up and goes out.

	EXT. MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)

	Arbogast comes out and looks off. He sees:

	THE LAST LIT CABIN

	The door ajar.

	C.U. - ARBOGAST - (NIGHT)

	would go along but he stops with a new thought. He turns 
	around and looks off.

	L.S. - THE OLD HOUSE FROM HIS VIEWPOINT - (NIGHT)

	C.U. - ARBOGAST

	comes to a decision. He goes off.

	L.S. ARBOGAST

	dashes up the stone steps to the House.

	MEDIUM SHOT

	CAMERA HOLDS as Arbogast goes up onto the porch. The house 
	is dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill 
	of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs 
	hall. Arbogast goes to the living room window, looks in, 
	sees only darkness. Then he goes to the door, listens for 
	along moment, hears nothing.

	Very slowly, almost painfully, he turns the knob of the door 
	and pushes gently with his arm and shoulder. The door begins 
	to open. He allows it to open just enough for him to slip 
	through and into the foyer.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. FOYER OF BATES' HOUSE - (NIGHT)

	Arbogast gradually eases the door closed, stands against it, 
	waiting. He looks up in the direction of the light, sees no 
	one. The door at the head of the stairs is closed. Arbogast 
	listens, holds his breath, hears what could be human sounds 
	coming from upstairs but realizes these could also be the 
	sounds of an old house after sunset. After a careful wait, 
	he crosses to the stairs, starts up, slowly, guardedly, 
	placing a foot squarely on each step to test it for squeaks 
	or groans before placing his full weight on it. CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS, remaining on floor level but TRAVELLING ALONG the 
	stairway as Arbogast makes his way up.

							 CUT TO:

	EXTREMELY HIGH ANGLE

	INT. STAIRWAY AND UPSTAIRS LANDING

	We see Arbogast coming up the stairs. And now we see, too, 
	the door of the mother's room, opening, carefully and slowly.

	As Arbogast reaches the landing, the door opens and the mother 
	steps out, her hand raises high, the blade of an enormous 
	knife flashing.

	C.U. - A BIG HEAD OF AN ASTONISHED ARBOGAST

	The knife slashes across his cheek and neck. Blood spurts. 
	The sudden attack throws him off balance. He stumbles back 
	and staggers down the whole of the staircase. He frantically 
	gropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the 
	stairs. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him all the way. A wicked knife 
	keeps thrusting itself into the foreground. As he collapses 
	at the bottom, the black head and shoulders of Mrs. Bates 
	plunges into the foreground as the CAMERA MOVES IN to contain 
	the raising and descending murder weapon.

							FADE OUT

							 FADE IN

	INT. BACK ROOM OF HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)

	Lila is sitting close by the phone, and looks as if she hasn't 
	moved from it in the last hour. Sam is pacing, occasionally 
	stopping at the window, glancing out, pacing again. The ash 
	tray close to Lila is filled.

	There is a thick atmosphere of smoke, tension and weariness 
	in the small, otherwise cozy room.

				SAM
			(at window, quietly)
		Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely 
		sound. Ever notice, Lila?

				LILA
			(unable to keep up 
			small talk)
		Sam. He said an hour. Or less.

				SAM
		It's been three.

				LILA
		Are we just going to go on sitting 
		here?

				SAM
			(suddenly cheerful)
		He'll be back. Let's sit still and 
		hang on, okay?

				LILA
		You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.

				SAM
		Hundreds! Which one is your pet?

				LILA
		Whenever I start contemplating the 
		panic button, your back straightens
		up and your eyes get that God-looks-
		out-for-everybody look and... I feel 
		better.

				SAM
		I feel better when you feel better.

				LILA
			(a pause - then she 
			rises)
		Where's the old highway?

				SAM
		You want to run out there, bust in 
		on Arbogast and the sick old lady, 
		shake her up and maybe spoil 
		everything Arbogast's been building 
		for the last three hours.

				LILA
		Yes.

				SAM
		That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.

				LILA
		Patience doesn't run in our family.
		Sam, I'm going out there!

				SAM
		Arbogast said...

				LILA
		An hour! Or less!

	Sam stares at her, frowns in concern over her very real 
	anxiety, goes to the phone, dials operator.

				SAM
			(into phone)
		Got the number of the motel out on 
		the old highway? Bates, I think.
			(waits)

				LILA
		Sam! Why call when we can go?

				SAM
		And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?
			(into phone)
		Thanks.

	He presses down the receiver, releases it, dials Bates'

	Motel. The faint other-end ringing tones can be heard, 
	repeatedly, annoyingly. He waits.

				SAM
			(to Lila)
		Probably on his way back right now.

				LILA
		Sam, I'm going.

				SAM
			(hangs up and picks 
			up his jacket)
		You'll never find it.

	He starts for the door. Lila follows after him into the store.

	INT. STORE

	He pauses halfway down, turns, puts his hands on her arms.

				SAM
		Stay here.

				LILA
		Why can't I go out there with you?

				SAM
			(looks at her)
		I don't know...
			(he collects himself)
		One of us has to be here in case 
		Arbogast's on the way.

				LILA
			(nervously)
		Just wait here?

				SAM
			(a warm smile)
		Contemplate your... panic button.

	He hurries down to the street door and out. CAMERA HOLDS on 
	Lila as she stares after Sam. As she stands alone in the 
	darkened store, all the hardware seems to take on sinister 
	shapes.

	C.U.

	Among some bathroom fittings a nozzle from a shower falls 
	onto the floor.

	MEDIUM SHOT

	Lila turns and picks if from the floor and puts it back in 
	its place. She turns and again looks to the deserted street 
	with a touch of anxiety. She gives a slight unconscious 
	shiver.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)

	Tall and lonely still against the moonlight, the figure of 
	Norman, silhouetted. He doesn't move, merely stands there at 
	the edge of the swamp, staring down at the now calm and quiet 
	face of it.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. THE MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)

	All light are out, except the light in Norman's mother's 
	room. And her figure can be seen sitting in the window, 
	relaxed in a high-back chair, her face turned into the room.  
	After a second, we hear the SOUND OF A MOTOR, and then Sam's 
	small pick-up truck swings into the driveway.

	Sam stops the motor, automatically switches off headlights, 
	pauses as he observes the silence and darkness of the area. 
	Then he hops out of the cab, goes quickly to the office, 
	knocks on the door. As he waits for a response, he looks 
	down the long porch, studies the darkened cabins, knocks 
	again, louder, looks in the other direction and sees the 
	house and the figure at the one lit window. He stares a moment 
	then calls loudly:

				SAM
		Arbogast?

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. THE SWAMP

	The silhouette of Norman. He is still. Over shot, very dimly, 
	comes the SOUND OF SAM'S VOICE, calling again for Arbogast.

	Norman turns slowly until, in silhouette, we see his profile, 
	his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in 
	the direction of the house. There is silence for a moment, 
	and then again the SOUND of Sam POUNDING at the door.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)

	The store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room 
	spilling in.

	L.S.

	With CAMERA placed with its back to the street door, we can 
	see the distant tiny figure of Lila seated and waiting in 
	the back room beyond. There is a SOUND of a car pulling up. 
	The tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back 
	room down the aisle of hardware and comes into a BIG HEAD. 
	We see Lila's desperate anxious look.

	MEDIUM SHOT

	From her viewpoint we see Sam alighting from his truck and 
	coming toward the door of the store. He enters. He and Lila 
	exchange quiet glances.

				SAM
		He didn't come back here?

				LILA
			(worriedly)
		Sam.

				SAM
		No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the 
		old lady at home...
			(frowning)
		A sick old lady unable to answer the 
		door... or unwilling.

				LILA
		Where could he have gone?

				SAM
		Maybe he got some definite lead.
		Maybe he went right on...

				LILA
		Without calling me?

				SAM
		In a hurry.

				LILA
		Sam, he called me when he had nothing 
		definite, nothing but a dissatisfied 
		feeling. Don't you think he'd have 
		called if he had anything...

				SAM
			(interrupting)
		Yes. I think he would have.

	Lila goes quiet. Sam starts toward the back room, pauses at 
	the doorway, turns. Lila has remained by the door, looking 
	out at the street. She feels his pause, turns, and for a 
	moment they share at each other across the darkened room.

				SAM
		Let's go see Al Chambers.

				LILA
		Who's he?

				SAM
		He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.

	As he starts forward.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. STREET THE SHERIFF LIVES ON - (NIGHT)

	A dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses 
	dim in the moonlight. Sam's pick-up truck comes down the 
	street, pulls up before the house of Sheriff Chambers. CAMERA 
	MOVES IN on Sam and Lila as they remain for a moment in the 
	truck's cab, staring quietly at the sleeping house.

				SAM
		Our Deputy sleeps.

				LILA
		Well?

				SAM
		Nothing.  Just... all the lights 
		out... must be asleep.

				LILA
			(a small exasperation)
		Does that mean we can't...

				SAM
		No. I'm just procrastinating.  People 
		hate when the doorbell rings in the 
		middle of the night.
			(gives up, starts out)
		Come on.

	He gets out of cab, goes around to help Lila. She is already 
	out. CAMERA FOLLOWS them up the small path to the front door. 
	Sam presses the bell button. Both he and Lila are almost 
	knocked over by the shocking, clanging, ear-splitting BLAST 
	OF THE BELL within the house, a ring which sounds more like 
	a fire alarm than a doorbell.

	He tries to smile, fails. Lila doesn't even try. The 
	downstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is 
	unhesitatingly opened by MRS. CHAMBERS, a small, lively stick 
	of a woman wrapped in a thick flannel robe and a corona of 
	hospitality.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Oh?

				SAM
		Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering 
		you...

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		You didn't!
			(a cross look up at 
			the bell)
		It's tinkerbell.
			(a quick smile at 
			Lila)
		Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if 
		anyone rings it in the middle of the 
		night.
			(to Sam)
		Well come on in, at least!

	As she opens the door wide,

							 CUT TO:

	INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL OF SHERIFF'S HOUSE - (NIGHT)

	Fat roses splatter the wallpaper. The stairs are carpeted. 
	The lighting is bright.

	There is a perfectly fitting wall phone by the parlor arch. 
	Mrs. Chambers goes to the stairway, yells up.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Albert!
			(a tiny wait, a smile 
			as Sam and Lila enter)
		Al Chambers!

	Sam is about to close the door behind him. Mrs. Chambers 
	motions for him not to, scurries across the hall, leans 
	outside, presses the doorbell. The RING within the house is 
	even more shattering. She closes the door, starts to the 
	stairway, pauses as the SOUNDS of movement above COME OVER 
	SHOT.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Customers!

	SHERIFF CHAMBERS comes down the stairs, in a bathrobe which 
	matches his wife's. He is a tall, narrow man with a face 
	originally destined for Mount Rushmore. He nods at Sam, looks 
	at him with wide-awake eyes and a no-nonsense concern.  

				SAM
		We have a problem.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
			(to Lila)
		Let's go out back and have some coca 
		while the men are talking.

				LILA
		No, thank you. It's my problem, too.

				SAM
		I don't know where to start...
			(a look at Lila)
		Except at the beginning.

				LILA
		Yes.

				SAM
			(to Sheriff)
		This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix.
		She's been here for a few days, 
		looking for her sister. There's a 
		private detective helping... and, 
		well, we got a call tonight, from 
		this detective, saying he'd traced 
		Mary...

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Mary is Lila's sister?

				SAM
		Yes. He traced her to that motel, 
		out on the old highway...

				MRS. CHAMBERS
			(to the Sheriff)
		Bates' Motel.
			(to Lila)
		He has a mind like a mechanical brain 
		and the more information you feed 
		it... Go on, Sam.

				SAM
		He traced her there and called us to 
		say he was going to question Mrs. 
		Bates...

				MRS. CHAMBERS
			(a pleasant shock)
		Norman took a wife?

				SAM
		No. An old woman, his mother.
			(to Sheriff, quickly)
		That was early this evening. And we 
		haven't seen or heard from him since.  
		I went out to the motel, just got 
		back. No one was in the office, and...

				LILA
			(interrupting, 
			anxiously)
		Will you help us? I think something's 
		wrong out there!

				SHERIFF
			(after a considerate 
			pause)
		Now. Your sister is missing how long?

				LILA
		She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. 
		And no trace until...

				SHERIFF
		How'd you and this detective come to 
		trace her to Fairvale?

				SAM
		They thought she'd be coming to me.

				SHERIFF
		Left Phoenix under her own steam?

				LILA
		Yes.

				SHERIFF
			(a pause)
		She ain't missing so much as she's 
		run away.

				SAM
		Yes.

				SHERIFF
		From what?

				LILA
			(a look at sam, then:)
		She stole some money.

				SHERIFF
		A lot?

				LILA
		Forty thousand dollars.

				SHERIFF
		And the police haven't been able 
		to...

				SAM
			(interrupting)
		Everyone concerned thought... if 
		they could get her to give back the 
		money... they could avoid involving 
		her with the police.

				SHERIFF
		Explains the private detective. He 
		traced her to the Bates place.  What'd 
		he exactly say when he called you?

				LILA
		Mary had been there, one night, and 
		had left.

				SHERIFF
		With the forty thousand dollars?

				LILA
		He didn't mention the money.
			(anxiously)
		What he said on the phone isn't 
		important, is it?  He was supposed 
		to come back after he spoke to the 
		mother, and he didn't! That's what I 
		want you to do something about!

				SHERIFF
		Like what?

				LILA
		Go out there! Find somebody, ask 
		some questions!
			(a pause)
		I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to 
		you. I keep thinking... something's 
		wrong. I have to know what!

				SHERIFF
		I think something's wrong, too, Miss. 
		But not the same thing. I think your 
		private detective is what's wrong.
			(As Lila is about to 
			object)
		I think he got himself a hot lead as 
		to where your sister was going... 
		probably from Norman Bates...  and 
		called you to keep you still while 
		he took off after her and the money.

				LILA
		He said he was dissatisfied... and 
		was going back.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
			(to Sheriff)
		Why don't you call Norman and let 
		him say just what happened, if he 
		give the man a hot lead and he did 
		just scooted off... it'll make the 
		girl feel better, Albert.

				SHERIFF
		At this hour?

				SAM
		He was out when I was there. If he's 
		back he probably isn't even in bed 
		yet.

				SHERIFF
		He wasn't out when you were there.  
		He just wasn't answering the door in 
		the dead of night... like some people 
		do. This fellow lives like a hermit...

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Recluse. Kinder word.

				SHERIFF
			(to Sam)
		You must remember that bad business 
		out there. About ten years ago...

				SAM
		I've only been here five. Right now 
		it feels like ten, but...

				LILA
		All right! Then call! At least, call!

	Mrs. Chambers goes to phone, dials operator.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
			(into phone)
		Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to 
		connect him with the Bates Motel.

	She hands the receiver to the Sheriff. He takes it, 
	reluctantly, listens to the dim sound of RINGING on the other 
	end. After a moment:

				SHERIFF
			(into phone)
		Norman? Sheriff Chambers.
			(listens)
		Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we 
		got some worries here. Did you have 
		a man stop out there tonight...
			(listens)
		Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, 
		anyway. A private detective, name 
		of...

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Arbogast.

				SHERIFF
			(into phone)
		Arbogast.
			(listens)
		And after he left?
			(listens)
		No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been 
		going out there?
			(listens)
		Well, I think you oughta unload that 
		place and open up closer in to the 
		action, a smaller place, you know... 
		but...

				LILA
		Please!

				SHERIFF
			(into phone)
		Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to 
		sleep. Yeah, be glad to.
			(hangs up, turns to 
			Mrs. Chambers)
		Said to give you his regards.

				SAM
			(faint irony)
		Was that all?

				SHERIFF
		This detective was out there and 
		Norman told him about the girl and 
		the detective thanked him and went 
		away.

				LILA
		And he didn't go back? Didn't see 
		the mother?

	The Sheriff looks long at Lila, shakes his head 
	sympathetically.

				SHERIFF
		You should've called in the police 
		the second you found your sister has 
		skipped. You go starting private 
		investigations, using people you 
		don't even know...

				LILA
		What difference does that...

				SHERIFF
		Your Detective told you a nakedfaced 
		lie.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Barefaced.

				SHERIFF
		He told you he wasn't coming right 
		back cause he wanted to question 
		Norman Bates' mother, right?

				LILA
		Yes.

				SHERIFF
			(a pause, then calmly)
		Norman Bates' mother has been dead 
		and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for 
		the last ten years!

	There is a long silence. Sam and Lila stare at the Sheriff.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		I helped Norman pick out the dress 
		she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

				SHERIFF
		It ain't only local history, Sam, 
		it's the only murder-and-suicide 
		case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs.
		Bates poisoned this guy she was... 
		involved with, when she found out he 
		was married, then took a helping of 
		the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. 
		Ugly way to die.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Norman found them dead together.  In 
		bed.

				SAM
		You mean that old woman I saw sittin' 
		in the window wasn't Norman Bates' 
		mother?

				MRS. CHAMBERS
			(hopefully, happily)
		Maybe you saw Mary!

				SAM
		I'd know the difference between Mary 
		and an old woman.

				SHERIFF
		Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you 
		saw an old woman?

				SAM
		Yes! In the house behind the motel. 
		I pounded and called but she... just 
		ignored me.

				SHERIFF
		And you want to tell me you saw Norman 
		Bates' mother.

				LILA
		It must've been. Arbogast said so, 
		too... and he said the young man 
		wouldn't let him see her because she 
		was ill!

	The Sheriff stares at both of them, and when he finally speaks 
	there is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice.

				SHERIFF
		Well, if the woman up there is Mrs.
		Bates... who's that woman buried out 
		at Greenlawn Cemetery?

						QUICK CUT TO:

	INT. NORMAN'S PARLOR BEHIND OFFICE - (NIGHT)

	Norman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone next to 
	him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to 
	move his hand after hanging up. He is staring at the shrike-
	like bird which is perched on the lamp shade. Decision and 
	resolution are beginning to show in his face. Suddenly he 
	rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off 
	the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking 
	the bird off the shade.

	He watches it fall, does not try to catch it. It hits the 
	floor with a thud and sawdust spills out. He stares sadly at 
	it, for a moment, then tends down, scoops up the sawdust, 
	tries to press it into the split seam, picks up the bird, 
	puts it in a drawer. Then he puts out the lamp, goes out, 
	crosses the darkened office and goes outside.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)

	Norman comes off the porch, walks to the path and directly 
	up to the house, opens the door and goes in.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRWAY - (NIGHT)

	SHOOTING UP THE STAIRS

	Norman goes up, pauses one moment outside his mother's door, 
	then opens it and goes in, leaving the door open.

	For a moment we hear only Norman's low, quiet voice, his 
	words indistinguishable. Then we hear the cold shot of his 
	mother's derisive laughter.

				MOTHER'S VOICE
		I am sorry, boy, but you do manage 
		to look ludicrous when you give me 
		orders!

				NORMAN'S VOICE
		Please, mother...

				MOTHER'S VOICE
			(Sharp, laughter all 
			gone)
		No! I will not hide in the fruit 
		cellar!
			(A shrill laugh)
		Think I'm fruity, huh?
			(Hard, cold again)
		I'm staying right here!  This is my 
		room and no one will drag me out of 
		it... least of all my big bold son!

				NORMAN'S VOICE
			(Rising now, anxiously)
		They'll come now, Mother. He came 
		after the girl and now someone will 
		come after him! How long do you think 
		you can go on... Mother, please, 
		just for a few days, just so they 
		won't find you!

				MOTHER'S VOICE
			(Mimicking)
		Just for a few days...
			(Furious)
		In that dank fruit cellar? No!  You 
		hid me there once, boy, and you won't 
		do it again! Not ever again!  Now 
		get out!
			(A pause, quiet)
		I told you to get out, boy!
			(A longer pause)
		Norman! What do you think you're 
		going to do? Don't you touch me!
		Don't! Norman!
			(A pause, then 
			cajolingly)
		All right, son, put me down and I'll 
		go. I'll go on my own two feet. I 
		can go on my own two feet, can't I?

	During all this the CAMERA has been slowly creeping up the 
	stairs. It does not stop at the top however, but continues 
	on the same high angle that we had in Scene 57.

	She starts to laugh, a terrible sound like an obscene melody.

				NORMAN'S VOICE
		I'll carry you, mother.

	Norman comes out of the room, his mother held in his arms, 
	her head leaning against his shoulder. He carries her down 
	the stairs, along the lower landing to the cellar stairs, 
	and then down those stairs to the basement.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. FAIRVALE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - (MORNING)

	An overcast morning, but a sunny-faced crowd. The service is 
	just over, there is contentment, and peace, and just a little 
	I-went-to-church-smugness in the faces of the churchgoers as 
	they come out of the chapel, and spread their separate ways 
	away.

	Amongst the crowd, waiting and searching the faces, are Sam 
	and Lila. In their expressions there is no peace, no 
	contentment. CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE. They are not speaking. 
	Lila looks as if she has had no sleep.

	Suddenly, Sam becomes alert, takes Lila's arm, starts toward 
	the church.

	CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM, stops as they approach Sheriff and 
	Mrs. Chambers. The Sheriff stares rather sympathetically at 
	Lila. Mrs. Chambers smiles nicely.

				SAM
		We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd 
		go out to the motel with you.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		He's already been.

				SHERIFF
		Went out before service.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Have you two had breakfast?

				SAM
			(To Sheriff, not a 
			question)
		You didn't find anything.

				SHERIFF
		Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.

	He moves away and the others follow. CAMERA PANS them to the 
	curb.

				LILA
			(Interrupting)
		Did he say anything about my sister?

				SHERIFF
		Just what he told your detective.

	She used a fake name, saw the register myself. Saw the whole 
	place, as a matter of fact. That boy is alone there.

				SAM
		No mother.

				SHERIFF
		You must've seen an illusion, Sam.
		Now, I know you're not the seeing-
		illusion type... But no woman was 
		illusion there and I don't believe 
		in ghosts, so there it is!

				LILA
		I still feel...

				SHERIFF
		Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't 
		make you feel better. You want to 
		come to my office this afternoon and 
		report a missing person... And the 
		theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner 
		you drop this thing in the lap of 
		the law, that's the sooner you'll 
		stand a chance of your sister bein' 
		picked up. How about that?

				LILA
		I don't know.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		It's Sunday. Come over and do the 
		reporting at the house, 'round dinner 
		time. Make it nicer. You too, Sam.

	She smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss 
	this year's charity fandango, takes the

	Sheriff's arm, starts away. The Sheriff nods as he goes.

	Sam and Lila are alone now, at the curb, before the deserted 
	chapel. For a long moment they just stand there, their faces 
	as gray and overcast as the sky.

				SAM
		Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.

				LILA
		You're not.

	Sam takes her arm, starts walking her up the street toward 
	the spot where his pick-up truck is parked.

	CAMERA FOLLOWS them.

				SAM
		Want me to drop you at the hotel?  
		Or you want to come over to the store?

	Lila does not answer. They reach the truck. Lila looks 
	directly at Sam as he helps her into the cab.

				LILA
		I won't feel satisfied unless I got 
		out there, Sam.

				SAM
		Neither will I.

	He slams the door, hurries around truck, gets into driver's 
	seat, starts motor. As the truck drives off,

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	SAM AND LILA IN TRUCK - (PROCESS - HIGHWAY)

	For a moment, both are silent; Sam watching the road as if 
	there were other cars on it, Lila staring at nothing in 
	particular, except perhaps her own inner fear.

				LILA
		I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.

				SAM
		Of course we will.

				LILA
		Alive.

	Sam looks as if he'd like to say something humorous, something 
	to cheer her. He cannot. He remains silent.

				LILA
		We lived together all our lives.

	When we woke up one morning and found ourselves orphans, 
	Mary quit college and got a job, so I could go to college.

				SAM
		Where'd you go to college?

				LILA
		I didn't. I got a job, too.
			(A pause)
		I wonder if that hurt her, my not 
		letting her sacrifice for me?  Some 
		people are so willing to suffer for 
		you that they suffer more if you 
		don't let them.

				SAM
			(Almost to himself)
		She was willing to lick the stamps.

	Lila looks quizzically at him, is too concerned to pursue 
	it.

				LILA
		I wonder so many things about her 
		now.  Why she never told me about 
		you...  Funny, when you think there's 
		an answer to everything, you think 
		you know all the answers.

				SAM
		We were going to get married. Are 
		going to get married!

				LILA
		Do you know how I found out about 
		you? I found one of your letters... 
		it was a nice letter, Sam.

				SAM
		This is the old highway.

				LILA
		I suppose... when you were able to 
		marry her she'd have presented you, 
		all shiny and proper... she always 
		tried to be proper.

				SAM
		Watch your tenses.

				LILA
		Huh?

				SAM
		She always tries to be proper.

	Sam slows the truck to a stop, sighs, starts to light up a 
	cigarette. Lila looks questioningly and impatiently at him.

				LILA
		You going to wait here for me?

				SAM
		I'm going with you. But we'd better 
		decide what we're going to say and 
		do when we walk in...

				LILA
		We're going to register. As man and 
		wife. And get shown to a cabin... 
		and then search every inch of that 
		place, inside and... outside.

				SAM
		You won't believe it...
			(Starts motor)
		But this will be the first time
		I've ever pulled one of those man-
		and-wife-renting-cabin capers!

				LILA
			(A tiny smile, first 
			in hours)
		I believe it.

	As truck starts to drive on,

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. THE BATES MOTEL AND HOUSE - (DAY)

	The place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep 
	gray of the cloudy sky. We see Sam's truck turning into the 
	driveway and pulling to a stop. After a moment, Sam and Lila 
	get out of the truck.

	FRESH ANGLE

	Close on Sam and Lila as they meet on the porch side of the 
	truck. The motel office and the house beyond can be seen in 
	b.g. of shot. Sam and Lila merely stare for a moment, then 
	turn and gaze up at the house. There is no figure in the 
	window and the shade is drawn. Same goes to the office door, 
	peers in, knocks, opens door, enters. Lila remains on the 
	driveway, beside the truck.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM - (DAY)

	CLOSE ANGLE on Norman standing by the window. He has pulled 
	the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at 
	the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is 
	standing by the truck and looking up at the house.  Norman 
	studies her, and as her eyes look up at this very window he 
	closes the curtains, turns away.

	We see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic 
	and his struggle to contain it. Then he goes away. CAMERA 
	remains on window, shooting out and down, and through the 
	frail curtains we can see Sam as he comes out of the motel 
	office and joins Lila.

	EXT. MOTEL OFFICE - CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA

				SAM
			(Unconsciously 
			whispering)
		I wonder where Norman Bates does his 
		hermiting?

				LILA
		Someone was at that window. I saw 
		the curtain move.

	Sam takes Lila's arm.

				SAM
		Come on.

	He starts with her toward the path which leads to the old 
	house. CAMERA PANS with them, and as they turn around the 
	office corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward 
	them. They pause and Norman pauses. He does not smile, nor 
	speak. His usual grin and soft friendliness are gone; 
	containment and impassivity lie in their place.

				SAM
			(Cheerfully)
		Just coming up to ring for you.

				NORMAN
			(Coming forward)
		I suppose you want a cabin.

				SAM
		We'd hoped to make it straight to 
		San Francisco, but we don't like the 
		look of that sky. Looks like a bad 
		day coming... doesn't it.

	Norman walks past Sam, giving him the sort of quick, 
	disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying, 
	goes onto the porch and into the office. Sam and Lila follow 
	Norman.

	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)

	Norman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to 
	cabin number twelve off the keyboard. Sam and Lila have 
	entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time.

				NORMAN
		I'll take you to...

				SAM
		Better sign in first, hasn't we?

	Sam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book.

				NORMAN
		It isn't necessary.

				SAM
			(Interrupting with a 
			friendly cheerfulness)
		Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this 
		trip... ninety percent business... 
		and he wants practically notarized 
		receipts. I better sign in and get a 
		receipt.

	Norman stares at Sam, as if he'd like to yell at him, call 
	him "liar." Instead he reaches under the desk counter, brings 
	out the registration book. Lila moves closer, studies the 
	book as Sam signs in. Sam signs "Joe and Mrs. Johnson."  The 
	signature and city of "Marie Samuels" and after it, the 
	notation "Cabin One," can be clearly seen three registrations 
	above Sam's.

	When Sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to Norman. 
	Norman does not take it, starts out from behind counter.

				NORMAN
		I'll get your bags.

				SAM
		Haven't any.

				NORMAN
			(after a stare)
		I'll show you the cabin.

	As he starts for the door, Sam laughs. Norman stops, turns, 
	looks at him.

				SAM
		First time I've seen it happen.
			(to Lila)
		Check in any place in this country 
		without bags, and you have to pay in 
		advance.

	Sam smiles as if at a funny remark, takes a bill out of his 
	pocket.

				NORMAN
		Ten dollars...

	Norman returns to Sam, takes the extended bill, is about to 
	start out again.

				SAM
		That receipt...?

	Norman goes reluctantly behind counter, lays down the key to 
	cabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under 
	counter, starts to write. Lila steps up to the desk, picks 
	up the key, quickly, starts out.

				LILA
		I'll start ahead.

	Norman looks up, gazes her as she goes out door.

	EXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)

	Lila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, tries 
	the door. It opens. She closes it quickly as she hears Sam 
	and Norman coming out of the motel office, continues on down 
	the porch.

				SAM
			(To Norman, who is 
			following)
		Don't bother yourself... we'll find 
		it.

	He goes on down the porch, doesn't even glance at cabin one, 
	walks quickly and catches up to Lila just as she reaches 
	cabin twelve. CAMERA REMAINS with Norman, who is standing by 
	the office door, looking after Sam and Lila, his face alert 
	and no longer impassive. He waits a moment, after they have 
	closed their cabin door, then crosses to the pickup truck.  
	CAMERA MOVES with him. He studies the truck, then leans in 
	through the driver's window, twists the registration card 
	around, reads it.

	It gives the correct name and address of Sam Loomis.

	Norman comes back out of the window, glances once more toward 
	cabin twelve, then at the old house. His suspicions are 
	confirmed, and now there is the relaxation of relief in his 
	face. He takes on a purposeful air, turns, strides up the 
	path, up onto the porch of the house, opens the door, goes 
	in.

	INT. CABIN TWELVE - (DAY)

	Lila is at the cabin's rear window, looking out, straining 
	for a glimpse of the old house, which cannot be seen from 
	the window of this cabin.

	She turns, frustrated, anxious. Sam is standing at the foot 
	of the bed, staring at the smooth coverlet, his brow creased 
	in a sadness.

				LILA
		We should have asked for Cabin One... 
		The one Mary was in.

				SAM
		I'm glad we didn't.

	He pulls his eyes from the bed, crosses to the desk, sits 
	wearily, lights a cigarette. Lila watches him for a moment, 
	feels a real compassion, goes to the bed, sits on its edge, 
	turns again and looks at Sam's back.

				LILA
		We have to go into that cabin and 
		search it, Sam... no matter what 
		we're afraid of finding and no matter 
		how much it may hurt.

				SAM
		I know.
			(A pause)
		Do you think if something happened, 
		it happened there?

				LILA
			(A pause, then:)
		Sam, if you owned a useless business 
		like this motel... one you probably 
		couldn't even sell...  what would 
		you need to get away, to start a new 
		business, somewhere else?
			(As Sam studies her)
		Forty thousand dollars?

				SAM
		How could we prove...
			(An almost hopeless 
			laugh)
		Well, if he opens a new motel on the 
		new highway... say, a year from now...

				LILA
		There must be some proof that exists 
		right now! Something that proves he 
		got that money away from Mary... 
		Some way!

				SAM
		What makes you sound so certain?

				LILA
		Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or 
		felt sorry for me... and he was 
		starting to feel the same about you. 
		I heard it when he called... in his 
		voice, a caring. He wouldn't have 
		gone anywhere or done anything without 
		telling us.  Unless he was stopped. 
		And he was stopped, so he must have 
		found out something!

	Sam considers a moment, nods agreement, rises.

				SAM
		We'll start with Cabin One.

	He goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then, 
	back to Lila:

				SAM
		If he sees us... we're just taking 
		the air.

	Lila goes to the door. He holds it open and she goes out.

	EXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)

	Sam closes the door, joins Lila, takes her hand.

	Together they walk along the porch in the direction of Cabin 
	One. CAMERA FOLLOWS. They pause before the door of Cabin 
	One. Sam motions Lila to wait, to hold still, then goes on 
	to the office, opens the door, calls in:

				SAM
		Bates?

	He waits, there is no response. He goes in and in a moment 
	comes back out, closes the door, goes to Lila.

	She has already opened the door of Cabin One and has started 
	to enter.

	INT. CABIN ONE - (DAY)

	The blinds are closed and the room is almost night-dark.

	Sam comes in after Lila, closes the door behind him.

	For a moment they just gaze at the room, as if willing it to 
	tell them some satisfactory story.

	Neither speaks. Then, in dark silence, they begin to search, 
	going methodically and thoroughly through all drawers, the 
	closet, the desk, searching under the bed and in dark corners, 
	not knowing what they expect to find and yet expecting to 
	find some thing. Lila opens the bathroom door, looks in. The 
	windowless room is very dark. She switches on the light, 
	goes in. Sam moves toward the bathroom, is about to follow 
	her in when he notices which room it is and automatically 
	catches himself up, backs out.

				SAM
		Sorry.

				LILA
		Hospital clean.

				SAM
		What?

				LILA
		The bathroom. Look at how clean it 
		is. The one in our cabin is clean... 
		but this is clean!

	Sam goes in, glances around, nods. Lila goes through the 
	medicine cabinet, finds nothing but a glass and two tiny 
	tabs of soap. Sam leans against the door-jamb, looks at the 
	tub, the shower pipe above it. He continues to stare, more 
	interested suddenly, as if bothered by some off-key evidence 
	he can't put his finger on. Then he looks at the shower 
	curtain rod.

	And realizes there is no shower curtain. He frowns, is about 
	to say something when Lila, who has been momentarily out of 
	shot, interrupts.

	Sam turns, CAMERA TURNS, and we see Lila is standing above 
	the toilet bowl, a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip 
	of her right index finger.

				SAM
		What is it?

				LILA
		It didn't get washed down. It's 
		figuring... the kind you tear up and 
		get rid of.
			(Extending her finger 
			toward Sam)
		Some figure has been added to or 
		subtracted from... forty thousand.

	Sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it, 
	takes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's 
	license shield, puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet 
	away.

				LILA
		That's proof Mary was here!  It would 
		be too wild a coincidence for somebody 
		else to...

				SAM
			(Reminding)
		Bates never denied Mary was here.

				LILA
			(Reminded)
		Yes.
			(A thought)
		But maybe this proves that Bates 
		found out about the money.

				SAM
		Do we simply ask him where he's hidden 
		it?

				LILA
		Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. 
		I think she told Arbogast something! 
		And I want her to tell us the same 
		thing!

	She starts out of the bathroom. Sam takes hold of her arm, 
	stops her.

				SAM
		You can't go up there.

				LILA
		Why not?

				SAM
		Bates.

	CAMERA STARTS TO PAN AWAY from them, moves slowly over the 
	room, very slowly.

				LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
		Let's find him. One of us can keep 
		him occupied while the other gets to 
		the woman.

				SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
		You won't be able to hold him still 
		if he doesn't want to be held. And I 
		don't like you going into that house 
		alone, Lila.

	CAMERA HAS PANNED clear across to the opposite wall now, and 
	is moving up closer and closer to the tiny-flowered wall 
	paper, finally closing in on one small rosebud.

				LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
		I can handle a sick old woman.

	Now we see that the rosebud has been cut out, that this is 
	the reverse side of the hole Norman peeped through to watch 
	Mary. And we see the pupil of Norman's eye now.

				SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
		All right. I'll find Bates and keep 
		him occupied.

	The eye moves away and there is a brief flash of light before 
	the hole is covered, on the other side, by the wall-hung 
	painting.

	FRESH ANGLE - LILA AND SAM

	They are about to start out. Sam stops her again.

				SAM
		Wait a minute. If you get anything 
		out of the mother...
			(A thought)
		Can you find your way back to town?
			(As Lila nods yes)
		If you do get anything, don't stop 
		to tell me.

	Lila nods quickly, hurries to the door. Sam gets to it first, 
	opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough 
	for Lila and Himself to pass through.

	EXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)

	ANGLE CLOSE on cabin one as Lila comes out, turns to her 
	left, goes along porch toward cabin twelve. Sam remains at 
	the door, then turns right, heading for the path. As he passes 
	the office, he is shocked to see Norman standing just inside 
	the open door.

				NORMAN
		Looking for me?

				SAM
			(Recovering)
		Yes, matter of fact.
			(The friendly grin)
		The wife's taking a nap and... I can 
		never keep quiet enough for her... 
		so I thought I'd look you up and... 
		talk.

				NORMAN
		Satisfied with your cabin?

				SAM
		Fine.

	Sam starts into the office. Just before going in, he glances 
	down the long porch, sees Lila standing outside the door of 
	cabin twelve, waves her a tiny "all clear" signal.

	LILA

	CAMERA ANGLES to include Lila and her point of view.

	She watches Sam disappear into the office, waits until she 
	hears the door close, then looks about for another way to 
	reach the house. She sees the small alley at the end of this 
	L of cabins, starts toward it.

	EXT. REAR OF MOTEL - S.C.U. LILA - (DAY)

	Behind the motel Lila hesitates. She looks ahead.

	LONG SHOT - (DAY)

	The old house standing against the sky.

	CLOSE UP - (DAY)

	Lila moves forward.

	LONG SHOT - (DAY)

	The CAMERA approaching the house.

	CLOSE UP - (DAY)

	Lila glances toward the back of Norman's parlor. She moves 
	on.

	LONG SHOT - (DAY)

	The house coming nearer.

	CLOSE UP - (DAY)

	Lila looks up at the house. She moves forward purposefully.

	S.L.S. - (DAY)

	The house and the porch.

	CLOSE UP - (DAY)

	Lila stops at the house and looks up. She glances back.

	She turns to the house again.

	S.L.S. - (DAY)

	The CAMERA MOUNTS the steps to the porch.

	C.U. - (DAY)

	Lila puts out her hand.

	S.C.U. - (DAY)

	Lila's hand pushes the door open. We see the hallway.

	Lila ENTERS PAST CAMERA.

	INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila closes the door, remains by it for a moment, quiet, 
	listening. Her eyes scan the layout, the closed door which 
	leads off the hallway, to the dining room on the right and 
	the parlor on the left. Down at the end of the hall is the 
	kitchen, the door wide open, the room beyond dim and silent. 
	She notices the stairs leading down to the basement, stares 
	at them, then back to the stairs leading to the second floor. 
	She starts forward, and seems about to investigate the parlor 
	and dining room.

	INT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)

	Norman is behind the counter, standing, staring at Sam who 
	is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa. Norman has the look of 
	one who is protecting himself, as if the counter were a 
	protective wall against the threatening world across it.

				SAM
			(Cheerfully, as if 
			after a self-conscious 
			pause)
		I've been doing all the talking so 
		far, haven't I?

				NORMAN
		Yes.

				SAM
		I always thought it was the people 
		who are alone so much who do all the 
		talking when they get the chance. 
		Yet there you are, doing all the 
		listening!
			(A pause)
		You are alone here, aren't you?
			(As Norman does not 
			reply)
		It would drive me crazy.

				NORMAN
		That would be a rather extreme 
		reaction, wouldn't it?

				SAM
			(Lightly)
		Just an expression...
			(More seriously)
		What I meant was... I'd do just about 
		anything... to get away.  Wouldn't 
		you?

	INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRS OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila is halfway up the stairs. As she climbs she is startled 
	by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps. She 
	steps more carefully. CAMERA remains at foot of stair, TILTING 
	UP as Lila climbs. She pauses at the head of the stair. The 
	door on her right, which opens into the mother's room, is 
	closed. To her left is another door, half-open. Directly 
	before her is a third door, closed. She holds a long moment, 
	trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on 
	the front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door, 
	the one on her right. She goes to it, knocks lightly.

	INT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM (DAY) - CLOSE ANGLE ON DOOR

	We hear Lila's second knock, then, faintly, her soft call.

				LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
		Mrs. Bates?

	There is quiet for a moment, then the door begins to open, 
	and we see Lila. She stands on the threshold, looking in at 
	the room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her 
	expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go 
	away from this room forever.

	After a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind 
	her. CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as 
	Lila sees it.

	It is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe, 
	an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of 
	the last century. The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the 
	dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a 
	great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full-
	length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite 
	the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the 
	window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled 
	with ashes.

	And there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if 
	even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long 
	vacated by some musty presence.

	Lila glances at the bed. The damask coverlet is thrown over 
	it, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on 
	it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb-
	like position. Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes 
	to the dressing table. Its top is scattered with boxes and 
	jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an 
	opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of 
	hair in its bristles. Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of 
	herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to 
	the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high 
	wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it, 
	hesitantly. She opens one door. Fresh, clean, well pressed 
	dresses hang neatly. Lila opens the other door. The sweaters 
	and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage-
	type bags. There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes.  
	Along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished 
	shoes. Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once 
	again over the whole room, starts out,

	INT. THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind 
	her, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to 
	the room whose door is half-open. The room within is dark, 
	the shades drawn full.

	Lila pauses on the threshold, reaches in, feels the wall, 
	throws on a switch.

	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)

	Sam has risen, is standing by the counter now.

				SAM
		I'm not saying you shouldn't be 
		contented here, I'm just doubting 
		that you are. I think if you saw a 
		chance to get out from under...  
		you'd unload this place...

				NORMAN
			(Angrily)
		This place! This isn't 'a place.'  
		It's my only world. I grew up in 
		that house back there. I was a happy 
		child. My mother and I... we were 
		more than happy.

				SAM
		And now that your mother's dead?

	Norman snaps a sharp, fast, ugly look at him.

				NORMAN
		My mother is not dead!

				SAM
			(Softly)
		I didn't think so.

	INT. NORMAN'S ROOM IN THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in sick 
	dismay. The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy 
	of childhood held beyond the point of decency.

	It is a small room. The walls are fancied with romping 
	silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and 
	fat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far 
	too short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpled 
	covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps.  
	Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top 
	there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an 
	ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown man's 
	shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree.

	Against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled 
	with thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white 
	chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The record 
	on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be 
	Beethoven's Eroica Symphony.

	Lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glances 
	at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcase 
	and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens 
	it. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust. 
	She slams the book closed, drops it.

	INT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)

	Norman, behind the counter, has moved back against the wall. 
	Sam is still on the other side of the counter, but is leaning 
	forward, his eyes hard on Norman's face.

	Norman's face is no longer expressionless. It has the stark, 
	high sheen of a cornered animal.

				SAM
			(Pressing)
		You look frightened. Have I been 
		saying something frightening?

				NORMAN
		I don't know what you've been saying.

				SAM
		I've been talking about your mother... 
		about your motel. How are you going 
		to do it?

				NORMAN
		Do what?

				SAM
		Buy a new one! In a new town!
		Where you won't have to hide your 
		mother!

				NORMAN
		Shut up!

				SAM
		Where will you get the money to do 
		that, Bates... or do you already 
		have it... socked away... a lot of 
		it...

				NORMAN
		Leave me alone!

				SAM
		...Forty thousand dollars!

				NORMAN
		Leave me alone!

	He is close to panic now. He turns, swiftly, dashes back 
	into his private parlor. Sam goes quickly around the counter, 
	follows.

	INT. NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)

	Norman hears Sam following, wants to run, to never be reached 
	by this man. He crosses the small room, drawn to the rear 
	window, as if he might fly through it. Sam enters, pauses.  
	Norman turns, back against the window, as unable to fly away 
	as are the many still, stuffed birds. Sam registers a brief 
	flicker of reaction when he sees the birds, but continues to 
	gaze at Norman, hard.

				SAM
		I bet your mother knows where the 
		money is. And what you did to get 
		it. And I think she'll tell us.

	Something self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives 
	Norman a new, more terrified alarm. He turns his head, glances 
	out the window at the old house. He looks back at Sam and 
	there is terror in his voice.

				NORMAN
		Where's that girl? The girl you came 
		with! Where is she?

	Sam does not respond, smiles a half-smile, turns to examine 
	a stuffed owl. Norman looks back at the house.

				NORMAN
			(A horrible groan)
		Oh, God!

	INT. UPSTAIRS HALL OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila, shaken and disturbed, almost sickened, is coming out 
	of Norman's room. She has left the light on. She pauses in 
	the middle of the landing, looks at the closed door opposite 
	the stairs, goes to it, opens it, sees that it is the 
	bathroom, pulls the door to, turns, starts toward the stairs.

	INT. NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)

	Sam is lying on the floor, face downward, unmoving. A 
	candlestick is on the floor, close by his head, still rocking 
	as if just dropped. OVER SHOT comes the SOUND of Norman's 
	footsteps and CAMERA TURNS in time to catch a brief glimpse 
	of him going out into the office, almost at a run.

	INT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila is on the top step, looking down toward CAMERA.

	She is listening, hoping to hear some human sound, some sound 
	she might follow, pursue. She hears nothing. She starts down 
	the stairs. Just below the halfway step, she looks at the 
	front door, sees out through the door window:

	LILA'S VIEWPOINT - (DAY)

	Norman coming.

	INT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	For a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps, 
	cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the 
	stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction. The 
	SOUND of Norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard. 
	Lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the 
	basement, going down far enough to conceal herself, crouching 
	there.

	Norman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listens. 
	He glances once in the direction of the basement stairs. He 
	seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes 
	from his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-time 
	state. He crosses to the stairway, goes up.

	Lila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to 
	the SOUNDS of Norman. His footsteps on the stairs followed 
	by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an 
	upstairs room. Convinced that he is searching the upstairs 
	for her, she decides to chance an escape. She starts up the 
	steps, is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is 
	caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement. She pauses, 
	looks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind the 
	not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar. The swift moving 
	SOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs.

	Lila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while 
	she has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to check 
	that hidden-looking room down below, a room in which, she 
	desperately believes, there must lie some answer to what 
	happened to Mary. She turns and goes softly and quickly down 
	the stairs.

	INT. THE BASEMENT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila reaches the bottom, stops, listens, hears the stairboards 
	creaking as footsteps fall hard and measured upon them. She 
	turns, pulls open the fruit cellar door, looks in. The woman 
	is sitting in a comfortable chair, the back of the chair, 
	and the woman, turned to the door. Lila calls a harsh, 
	frightened whisper.

				LILA
		Mrs. Bates...?

	Lila goes into the room.

	INT. THE FRUIT CELLAR

	Lila goes to the chair, touches it. The touch disturbs the 
	figure. It starts to turn, slowly, stiffly, a clock-wise 
	movement. Lila looks at it in horror. It is the body of a 
	woman long dead. The skin is dry and pulled away from the 
	mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile.  
	The eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose 
	has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are 
	sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and 
	flaky. The body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pressed 
	dress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed.

	The movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turning 
	as if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually 
	graceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obscene.

	Lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begins 
	to scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream.

	And Lila's scream is joined by another scream, a more 
	dreadful, horrifying scream which comes from the door behind 
	her.

				NORMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
			(screaming)
		Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma 
		Bates!

	Lila turns.

	NORMAN

	His face is contorted. He wears a wild wig, a mockery of a 
	woman's hair. He is dressed in a high-neck dress which is 
	similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother. His hand 
	is raised high, poised to strike at Lila. There is a long 
	breadknife in it.

	LILA

	Close on her face. She is dumb-struck. Her eyes are screaming.

	BACK TO NORMAN

	As he is about to start forward, a man's hand reaches in 
	from the doorway behind, grabs Norman's wrist. Sam comes 
	through the door, still holding tight to the wrist, pulling 
	back the arm and at the same time throwing himself at Norman, 
	football tackle style.

	SERIES OF CUTS - THE FIGHT

	Norman and Sam, struggling. The wild fury in Norman's face, 
	the mad noise of his screams and vile curses. The terrified, 
	fight-to-the-death look of Sam. The still, staring Lila.

	MRS. BATES

	A close of her face, She appears to be watching and enjoying 
	the fight. Over the shot, the SOUNDS of the struggle, the 
	screams of Norman.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. COURTHOUSE AT READING - (NIGHT)

	There are many people gathered about the steps, the curious 
	and the concerned and the morbid. At the curb, a couple of 
	newspaper cars, two or three police cars, and a mobile unit 
	truck from the local television outlet. There is noise, and 
	chattering as questions are asked and answers given, and the 
	sounds of traffic, and of the television equipment being 
	moved into the courthouse, for on-the-scene reporting, and 
	the stern voices of policemen trying to keep people back. 
	The scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden 
	light thrown on a fearful darkness.

	CLOSER ANGLE ON STEPS OF COURTHOUSE

	A POLICEMAN trying to make way for the television men, 
	muttering "keep back," etc., to the spectators. A TELEVISION 
	MAN, carrying a piece of equipment goes through door, and 
	CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the courthouse vestibule.

	Here, too, there is a crowd, composed of Policemen, Reporters, 
	Television Men. The Television Men we have been following 
	stops beside a Policeman.

				TELEVISION MAN
			(Indicating the front 
			door he has just 
			come in through)
		You think they'll take him out that 
		way?

				POLICEMAN
			(Looking at waiting 
			crowd, shrugging)
		Probably have to.
			(A rueful smile)
		Besides, the taxpayers hate it when 
		something gets slipped out the back 
		door on them!

	Over this exchange, the buzz of other voices, the movement 
	of men. CAMERA MOVES ON, down the corridor, gets to the door 
	of the office of the Chief of Police just as a young fellow 
	with a carton box filled with paper containers of sent-out-
	for coffee reaches this door. CAMERA HOLDS as the COFFEE BOY 
	pauses a moment, then goes into the room.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE - (NIGHT)

	Lila is seated in a chair, Sam standing close by. A bit apart 
	from them, we see Sheriff Chambers, in quiet conference with 
	the CHIEF OF POLICE, the COUNTY SHERIFF, the DISTRICT 
	ATTORNEY.

	The Coffee Boy stands in the doorway. Sam goes to him, takes 
	a container of coffee from the box, carries it to Lila, 
	checking the notation on the lid as he goes.

	MED. CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA

				SAM
			(quietly)
		It's regular. Okay?

				LILA
			(ruefully)
		I could stand something regular.

	Sam smiles encouragingly, hands her the coffee. Sheriff 
	Chambers ENTERS SHOT, gives Sam a container of coffee he has 
	brought for him. Sam takes it, nods a thank you.

	For a moment no one speaks. Lila looks badly shaken, Sam 
	disheveled, but contained.

				CHAMBERS
		You two can go on home if you like.
			(a sympathetic look 
			at Lila)
		Making that statement was enough for 
		one night.

				SAM
			(to Lila)
		Want to?

				LILA
		No. I'm all right. I'll feel better 
		when all this is explained... if it 
		can be.

	Sam looks a question at Sheriff Chambers. Chambers shrugs 
	doubtfully.

				CHAMBERS
		If anybody gets any answers, it'll 
		be the fellow talking to him now... 
		the Psychiatrist. Even I couldn't 
		reach Norman... and he knows me.
			(to Lila)
		You warm enough, Miss?

	Lila is about to answer, when she sees someone come into the 
	room and rises anxiously. Sam and Sheriff Chambers turn, 
	follow her gaze.

	INT. OFFICE OF CHIEF OF POLICE - FULL SHOT

	A young man with a serious, frowning face has just come into 
	the room. He is DR. SIMON, the Psychiatrist.

	He goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has 
	been placed, takes up a container.

				DISTRICT ATTORNEY
		Did he talk to you?

				SIMON
		No. I got the whole story... but not 
		from Norman. I got it from... his 
		mother.

	Everyone gazes at him, mystified. He speaks as he removes 
	lid from coffee container.

				SIMON
		Norman Bates no longer exists. He 
		only half-existed to begin with...  
		now, the other half has taken over.  
		Probably for all time.

				LILA
			(With difficulty)
		Did he kill my sister?

				SIMON
		Yes... and no.

				DISTRICT ATTORNEY
		Look, if you're trying to lay a lot 
		of psychiatric groundwork for some 
		sort of plea this fellow would like 
		to cop...

				SIMON
		A psychiatrist doesn't lay the 
		groundwork .. he merely tries to 
		explain it.

				LILA
		But my sister is...

				SIMON
		Yes. I'm sorry.
			(to Chambers)
		The Private Investigator, too. If 
		you drag that swamp somewhere in the 
		vicinity of the motel...
			(To the Chief of Police)
		Have you any unsolved missing persons 
		cases on your books?

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Yes. Two.

				SIMON
		Young girls?

				CHIEF OF POLICE
			(nods, astounded, 
			then:)
		Did he confess to...

				SIMON
			(interrupting)
		As I said, the mother...
			(Pauses, goes on afresh)
		To understand it, as I understood it 
		hearing it from the mother...  That 
		is, from the mother-half of Norman's 
		mind, you have to go back ten years... 
		to the time when Norman murdered his 
		mother and her lover.
			(A pause, then as no 
			one interrupts)
		He was already dangerously disturbed, 
		had been ever since his father died. 
		His mother was a clinging, demanding 
		woman... and for years the two of 
		them lived as if there was no one 
		else in the world. Then she met a 
		man and it seemed to Norman she "threw 
		him over" for this man. That pushed 
		him over the thin line... and he 
		killed them both. Matricide is 
		probably the most unbearable crime 
		of all... and most unbearable to the 
		son who commit it. So he had to erase 
		the crime, at least in his own mind.
			(A pause)
		He stole her corpse... and a weighted 
		coffin was buried. He hid the body 
		in the fruit cellar, even "treated" 
		it to keep it as well as it would 
		keep. And that still wasn't enough. 
		She was there, but she was a corpse.  
		So he began to think and speak for 
		her, gave her half his life, so to 
		speak. At times he could be both 
		personalities, carry on 
		conversations... at other times, the 
		mother-half took over completely. He 
		was never all Norman, but he was 
		often only mother. And because he 
		was so pathologically jealous of 
		her, he assumed she was as jealous 
		of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong 
		attraction to any other woman, the 
		mother side of him would go wild.
			(To Lila)
		When Norman met your sister, he was 
		touched by her... and aroused by 
		her. He wanted her. And this set off 
		his "jealous mother" and...  "mother 
		killed the girl." After the murder, 
		Norman returned as if from a deep 
		sleep... and like a dutiful son, 
		covered up all traces of the crime 
		he was convinced his mother had 
		committed.

				SAM
		Why was he... dressed like that?

				DISTRICT ATTORNEY
		He's a transvestite!

				SIMON
		Not exactly. A man who dresses in 
		woman's clothing in order to achieve 
		a sexual change... or satisfaction... 
		is a transvestite.  But in Norman's 
		case, he was simply doing everything 
		possible to keep alive the illusion 
		of his mother being alive. And 
		whenever reality came too close, 
		when danger or desire threatened 
		that illusion, he'd dress up, even 
		to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd 
		walk about the house, sit in her 
		chair, speak in her voice... He tried 
		to be his mother.
			(A sad smile)
		And now he is.
			(A pause)
		That's what I meant when I said I 
		got the story from the mother. She 
		thinks Norman has been taken away... 
		because of his crimes.  She insists 
		she did nothing, that Norman committed 
		all the murders just to keep her 
		from being discovered. She even smiled 
		a bit coquettishly as she said that. 
		Of course, she feels badly about 
		it... but also somewhat relieved to 
		be, as she put it, free of Norman, 
		at last.
			(A pause)
		When the mind houses two 
		personalities, there is always a 
		battle. In Norman's case, the battle 
		is over... and the dominant 
		personality has won.

	Lila begins to weep softly, for Mary, for Arbogast, for 
	Norman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world. 
	Sam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts her.

				CHAMBERS
			(To Simon)
		And the forty thousand dollars?  Who 
		got that?

				SIMON
		The swamp. These were murders of 
		passion, not profit.

	A POLICE GUARD puts his head in the door, speaks, in a near-
	whisper, to the Chief of Police. The Guard is carrying a 
	folded blanket over his arm.

				POLICE GUARD
		He feels a little chill... can I 
		bring him this blanket?

	The Chief of Police nods. The Guard goes away, and CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS him out of the room and out into the hallway. Guard 
	moves through the waiting men, heading down the corridor.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR IN COURTHOUSE

	A narrower corridor in the rear of the building. In f.g. of 
	shot, we see a door, the top half of which is wire-covered 
	glass. A GUARD in uniform is posted by the door, looking 
	reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance 
	into the room.

	The Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this 
	corridor, goes to the door. CAMERA MOVES CLOSE. The uniformed 
	Guard opens the door, allows the man to go in.

	Shot is RAKED so that we can not see into the room.

	After a moment, the Guard comes out and the uniformed Guard 
	closes and locks the door and we

							 CUT TO:

	INT. NORMAN'S DETENTION ROOM - (NIGHT)

	The walls are white and plain. There is no window.

	There is no furniture except the straight-back chair in which 
	Norman sits, in the center of the room. The room has a quality 
	of no-whereness, of calm separation from the world.

	The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees. 
	Norman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding 
	it. His face, although without makeup and without the 
	surrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity 
	about it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch 
	womanliness about the brows.

	Calmly, Norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as if 
	it were a cashmere shawl. CAMERA REMAINS in a position so 
	that our view of Norman is a FULL ONE. When the shawl is in 
	position, and Norman is settled, we HEAR, OVER SHOT, the 
	voice of his mother, coming from the calm of his thoughts.

				MOTHER'S VOICE (O.S.)
		It's sad... when a mother has to 
		speak the words that condemn her own 
		son... but I couldn't allow them to 
		believe that I would commit murder.
			(A pause)
		They'll put him away now... as I 
		should have... years ago. He was 
		always... bad. And in the end, he 
		intended to tell them I killed those 
		girls... and that man. As if I could 
		do anything except just sit and 
		stare... like one of his stuffed 
		birds.
			(A pause)
		Well, they know I can't even move a 
		finger. And I won't. I'll just sit 
		here and be quiet. Just in case they 
		do... suspect me.

	A fly buzzes close, and then continues buzzing and flying 
	about Norman's face.

				MOTHER'S VOICE (V.O.)
		They're probably watching me.  Well, 
		let them. Let them see what kind of 
		a person I am.
			(A pause, as the fly 
			lights on Norman's 
			hand)
		I'm not going to swat that fly. I 
		hope they are watching. They'll see... 
		they'll see... and they'll know... 
		and they'll say... 'why, she wouldn't 
		even harm a fly...'

	Norman continues to gaze ahead into nothing.

					SCENE BEGINS TO DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO:

	THE SWAMP

	As END TITLES FADE IN, we see the swamp, the chain of a tow-
	truck. The chain is attached to Mary's car. The car is coming 
	out of the swamp.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. PHOENIX, ARIZONA - (DAY) - HELICOPTER SHOT

	Above Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a 
	hot mid-summer day. The city is sun-sunblanched white and 
	its drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes. 
	We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over 
	traffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business 
	buildings, neatly patterned residential districts. As we 
	approach downtown section, the character of the city begins 
	to change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We 
	see railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and-
	vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots.  
	vegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of 
	nefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy. And secret.

	We fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific 
	location. A skinny, high old hotel comes into view. On its 
	exposed brick side great painted letters advertise "Transients-
	Low Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room." We pause long enough 
	to establish the shoddy character of this hotel. Its open, 
	curtainless windows, its silent resigned look so 
	characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward 
	with purposefulness and-toward a certain window. The sash is 
	raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to 
	three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants 
	of the room within wanted privacy but needed air. We are 
	close now, so that only the lower half of the window frame 
	is in shot. No sounds come from within the room.

	Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between 
	shade and sill, peep into the room.

	A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears 
	a full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitude 
	of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of 
	the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome 
	conflicts. She is MARY CRANE, an tension, attractive girl 
	nearing the end of her twenties and her rope.

	A man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure 
	visible. We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then 
	start forward. As we pass under the window shade,

							 CUT TO:

	INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - (DAY)

	A small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow 
	bed. A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the 
	bureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open-
	top handbag are on the bureau.

	On the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco-
	Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There 
	is no radio.

	The man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt 
	and sox, is SAM LOOMIS, a good-looking, sensual shirt man 
	with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is blotting 
	his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at 
	Mary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth. Mary keeps 
	her face turned away from him.

	After a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans 
	over and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her long and warmly, 
	holds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed 
	and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an 
	inconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow 
	Mary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns 
	at her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, intimate, 
	playful voice.

				SAM
		Never did eat your lunch, did you.

	Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, 
	kisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings 
	her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds 
	her shoes, slips her feet into searches them. And finally 
	pulls away and sits up.

				MARY
		I better get back to the office.  
		These extended lunch hours give my 
		boss excess acid.

	She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings 
	out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or 
	perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam 
	watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, 
	humorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they 
	occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc.

				SAM
		Call your boss and tell him you're 
		taking the rest of the afternoon 
		off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.

				MARY
			(soft sarcasm)
		What do I do with my free afternoon, 
		walk you to the airport?

				SAM
			(meaningfully)
		We could laze around here a while 
		longer.

				MARY
		Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels 
		of this sort aren't interested in 
		you when you come in, but when your 
		time's up...
			(a small anguish)
		Sam, I hate having to be with you in 
		a place like this.

				SAM
		I've heard of married couples who 
		deliberately spend occasional nights 
		in cheap hotels. They say it...

				MARY
			(interrupting)
		When you're married you can do a lot 
		of things deliberately.

				SAM
		You sure talk like a girl who's been 
		married.

				MARY
		Sam!

				SAM
		I'm sorry, Mary.
			(after a moment)
		My old Dad used to say 'when you 
		can't change a situation, laugh at 
		it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like 
		laughing at it.

				MARY
		I've lost my girlish laughter.

				SAM
			(observing)
		The only girlish thing you have lost.

				MARY
			(a meaningful quiet, 
			then, with difficulty:)
		Sam. This is the last time.

				SAM
		For what?

				MARY
		This! Meeting you in secret so we 
		can be... secretive! You come down 
		here on business trips and we steal 
		lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't 
		even come.

				SAM
		Okay. What do we do instead, write 
		each other lurid love letters?

				MARY
			(about to argue, then 
			turning away)
		I haven't time to argue. I'm a working 
		girl.

				SAM
		And I'm a working man! We're a regular 
		working-class tragedy!
			(he laughs)

				MARY
		It is tragic! Or it will be... if we 
		go on meeting in shabby hotels 
		whenever you can find a tax-deductible 
		excuse for flying down deductible 
		here...

				SAM
			(interrupting, 
			seriously)
		You can't laugh at it, huh?

				MARY
		Can you?

				SAM
		Sure. It's like laughing through a 
		broken jaw, but...

	He breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, 
	tries to raise the shade. It sticks. He pulls at it.

	It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room, 
	revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if 
	corroborating Mary's words and attitude. Sam kicks at the 
	fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor 
	again.

				SAM
		And besides, when you say I make tax-
		deductible excuses you make me out a 
		criminal.

				MARY
			(having to smile)
		You couldn't be a criminal if you 
		committed a major crime.

				SAM
		I wish I were. Not an active criminal 
		but... a nice guy with the conscience 
		of a criminal.
			(goes close to mary, 
			touches her)
		Next best thing to no conscience at 
		all.

				MARY
			(pulling away)
		I have to go, Sam.

				SAM
		I can come down next week.

				MARY
		No.

				SAM
		Not even just to see you, to have 
		lunch... in public?

				MARY
		We can see each other, we can even 
		have dinner... but respectably, in 
		my house with my mother's picture on 
		the mantel and my sister helping me 
		broil a big steak for three!

				SAM
		And after the steak... do we send 
		Sister to the movies and turn Mama's 
		picture to the wall?

				MARY
		Sam! No!

				SAM
			(after a pause, simply)
		All right.

	She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue 
	the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised 
	when they discover men will continue to want them even after 
	the sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, 
	places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and 
	simple sincerity.

				SAM
		Mary, whenever it's possible, tax-
		deductible or not, I want to see 
		deductible you. And under any 
		conditions.
			(a smile)
		Even respectability.

				MARY
		You make respectability sound...  
		disrespectful.

				SAM
			(brightly)
		I'm all for it! It requires patience 
		and temperance and a lot of sweating-
		out... otherwise, though, it's only 
		hard work.
			(a pause)
		But if I can see you, touch you even 
		as simply as this... I won't mind.

	He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems 
	crushes away his good humor. There is a quiet moment.

				SAM
		I'm fed up with sweating for people 
		who aren't there. I sweat to pay off 
		my father's debts... and he's in his 
		grave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife 
		alimony, and she's living on the 
		other side of the world somewhere.

				MARY
			(a smile)
		I pay, too. They also pay who meet 
		in hotel rooms.

				SAM
		A couple of years and the debts will 
		be paid off. And if she ever re-
		marries, the alimony stops... and 
		then...

				MARY
		I haven't even been married once 
		yet!

				SAM
		Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.

				MARY
			(smiling, then with a 
			terrible urgency)
		Sam, let's go get married.

				SAM
		And live with me in a storeroom behind 
		a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll 
		have a lot of laughs. When I send my 
		ex-wife her money, you can lick the 
		stamps.

				MARY
			(a deep desperation)
		I'll lick the stamps.

	He looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, 
	looks out the window and stares at the wide sky.

				SAM
		You know what I'd like? A clear, 
		empty sky... and a plane, and us in 
		it... and somewhere a private island 
		for sale, where we can run around 
		without our... shoes on.  And the 
		wherewithal to buy what I'd like.
			(he moves away, 
			suddenly serious)
		Mary, you want to cut this off, go 
		out and find yourself someone 
		available.

				MARY
		I'm thinking of it.

				SAM
			(a cheerful shout)
		How can you even think a thing like 
		that!

				MARY
			(picking up handbag, 
			starting for door)
		Don't miss your plane.

				SAM
		Hey, we can leave together can't we?

				MARY
			(at door)
		I'm late... and you have to put your 
		shoes on.

	Mary goes out quickly, closing door behind her. As Sam stares 
	down at his shoeless feet,

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - (DAY) - HIGH ANGLE

	Shooting down at hotel entrance. Mary comes out, walks quickly 
	to a parked cab, gets in. The cab zooms up the awful street.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. LOWERY REAL ESTATE OFFICE - (DAY)

	A small, moderately successful office off the main street. A 
	cab pulls up at the curb. We see Mary get out of cab, pay 
	driver, cross pavement to the office door.

	INT. OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)

	Mary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her 
	temples, finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last 
	of her teens.

				MARY
		Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?

				CAROLINE
			(a high, bright, eager-
			to-talk voice laced 
			to-with a vague Texan 
			accent)
		He's lunching with the man who's 
		buying the Harris Street property, 
		you know, that oil lease man...  so 
		that's why he's late.
			(a pause, then, as 
			Mary does not respond 
			to the pointed thrust)
		You getting a headache?

				MARY
		It'll pass. Headaches are like 
		resolutions... you forget them soon 
		as they stop hurting.

				CAROLINE
		You got aspirins? I have something... 
		not aspirins, but
			(cheerfully takes 
			bottle of pills out 
			of desk drawer)
		my mother's doctor gave these to me 
		the day of my wedding.
			(laughs)
		Teddy was furious when he found out 
		I'd taken tranquilizers!

	She rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand.

				MARY
		Were there any calls?

				CAROLINE
		Teddy called.  Me... And my mother 
		called to see if Teddy called. Oh, 
		and your sister called to say she's 
		going to Tucson to do some buying 
		and she'll be gone the whole weekend 
		and...

	She breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening. 
	MR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY enter the 
	office. Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a 
	trifle pompous. Cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch-
	hour load on. He is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful 
	vulgarity.

				CASSIDY
		Wow! Hot as fresh milk! You girls 
		should get your boss to air-condition 
		you up. He can afford it today.

	Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead 
	Cassidy toward the private office.

				LOWERY
		Mary, will you get those copies of 
		the deed ready for Mr. Cassidy.

	Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the 
	desktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary.

				CASSIDY
		Tomorrow's the day! My sweet little 
		girl...
			(laughs as Mary looks 
			up at him)
		Not you, my daughter!  A baby, and 
		tomorrow she stands up there and 
		gets her sweet self married away 
		from me!
			(pulling out wallet)
		I want you to look at my baby.  
		Eighteen years old... and she's never 
		had an unhappy day in any one of 
		those years!
			(flashes photo)

	Mary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some 
	remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore 
	the man's hot-breath closeness.

				LOWERY
		Come on, Tom, my office is air-
		conditioned.

				CASSIDY
			(ignoring Lowery)
		You know what I do with unhappiness? 
		I buy it off! You unhappy?

				MARY
		Not inordinately.
			(puts deed copy into 
			Cassidy's too-close 
			hand)

				CASSIDY
		I'm buying this house for my baby's 
		wedding present. Forty thousand 
		dollars, cash! Now that ain't buying 
		happiness, that's buying off 
		unhappiness! That penniless punk 
		she's marryin'...
			(laughs)
		Probably a good kid... it's just 
		that I hate him.
			(looks at deed)
		Yup! Forty thousand, says here...
			(to Lowery)
		Casharoonie!

	He takes out of his inside pocket, two separate bundles of 
	new $100 bills and throws them onto the desk, under Mary's 
	nose. Caroline's eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious 
	green bundles of bills, and she comes close to the desk. 
	Cassidy leans terribly close to Mary, flicks through the 
	bills, laughs wickedly.

				CASSIDY
		I never carry more than I can afford 
		to lose!
			(closer to Mary)
		Count 'em!

				LOWERY
			(shocked, worried)
		Tom... cash transactions of this 
		size! Most irregular...

				CASSIDY
		So what? It's my private money!
			(laughs, winks, elbows 
			Lowery)
		And now it's yours.

				CAROLINE
			(staring at the money)
		I declare!

				CASSIDY
			(whispering)
		I don't! That's how I'm able to keep 
		it!
			(laughs)

				LOWERY
			(hastily interrupting)
		Suppose we just put this in the safe 
		and then Monday morning when you're 
		feeling good...

				CASSIDY
		Speakin' of feeling good, where's 
		that bottle you said you had in your 
		desk...
			(laughs, as if having 
			given away Lowery's 
			secret)
		Oops!
			(to Mary, patting her 
			arm)
		Usually I can keep my mouth shut!

	He rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks 
	to Mary, meaningfully.

				CASSIDY
		Honest. I can keep any private 
		transaction a secret... any pri....
			(stopped by Mary's 
			cold gaze)
		Lowery! I'm dyin' of thirstaroonie!

	Lowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary. Cassidy has 
	gone into Lower's office.

				LOWERY
			(quietly)
		I don't even want it in the office 
		over the weekend. Put it in the safe 
		deposit box, at the bank, Mary. And 
		we'll get him to give us a check on 
		Monday - instead.

	He starts quickly away when it looks like Cassidy is going 
	to come and pull him bodily into the office. When the men 
	are gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle, 
	smiles at it.

				CAROLINE
		He was flirting with you. I guess he 
		noticed my wedding ring.

	Mary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the 
	other from Caroline. When the bills are away, she puts the 
	filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed 
	copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office 
	door, knocks, starts to open door as:

				LOWERY (O.S.)
		Come in.

	INT. LOWERY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - (DAY)

	Mary opens door, looks in. Cassidy is drinking from a large 
	tumbler, winks at her without pausing in his drinking. Mary 
	remains on threshold a moment, then crosses to the desk, 
	talking as she goes.

				MARY
		The copies. Mr. Lowery, if you don't 
		mind, I'd like to go right on home 
		after the bank. I have a slight...

				CASSIDY
		You go right home!  Me and your boss 
		are going out to get ourselves a 
		little drinkin' done!
			(to Lowery)
		Right?

				LOWERY
			(to Mary)
		Of course. You feeling ill?

				MARY
		A headache.

				CASSIDY
		You need a week-end in Las Vegas... 
		playground of the world!

				MARY
		I'm going to spend this week-end in 
		bed.
			(starts out)

				CASSIDY
			(to Lowery)
		Only playground that beats Las Vegas!

	Mary goes back out into the outer office, closes door.

	INT. OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)

	Mary goes to her desk, takes the handbag, checks to make 
	sure the money-filled envelope is tucked well down into it. 
	During this:

				CAROLINE
		Aren't you going to take the pills?
			(as Mary shakes her 
			head)
		They'll knock that headache out.

				MARY
		I don't need pills... just sleep.

	She goes to the door.

							 DISSOLVE:

	INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - (DAY)

	A double bed in the foreground. We just see the far side as 
	the CAMERA SHOOTS across. Mary enters the scene, clad only 
	in her slip. Perhaps she is about to get into bed. Behind 
	her is an open closet, but too dark inside for us to see any 
	contents. As Mary turns to the closet the CAMERA LOWERS to 
	show a close view of the $40,000 in the envelope on our side 
	of the bed.

	Mary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on 
	as the CAMERA RETREATS to reveal a packed but not yet closed 
	suitcase also on the bed. Mary zips up her dress and then 
	brings some final garments from the closet.

	She comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top. 
	Mary works with haste and in tension, as if acting on an 
	impulse which might vanish as quickly as it came.

	The suitcase filled now, she checks around the room, then 
	takes her handbag to the bed, puts in the money-filled 
	envelope, and then slams the suitcase shut. Then filled she 
	looks at her small bedroom desk, goes to it, removes a small 
	file-envelope from one of the drawers. It is one of those 
	brown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and 
	policies and certificates. She checks its contents briefly, 
	puts it on the bed, opens another desk drawer, takes out her 
	bank book, tosses it on the bed. Then she packs both the 
	file-envelope and the bank book, into her handbag, takes one 
	quick last look around the room, picks up the handbag and 
	the suitcase and goes out of the room.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. MARY'S GARAGE - (DAY)

	A two-car garage. One car is gone. Mary's car is parked in 
	the driveway. The CAMERA is low enough so that we can easily 
	read the Arizona number plate in the foreground.

	Mary comes out of house, starts for the trunk, intending to 
	put the suitcase in, changes her mind, places the suitcase 
	and her handbag on the front seat, gets in, starts the car, 
	begins to back out of driveway.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)

	We are close on Mary's car, shooting in at her troubled, 
	guilty face. She seems to be driving with that excess care 
	of one who does not wish to be stopped for a minor traffic 
	irregularity. She stops for a red light at a main 
	intersection.

	FROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT - (DAY)

	We see Lowery and Cassidy crossing the street, passing right 
	in front of Mary's car.

	MARY'S CAR - (DAY)

	Mary freezes.

	EXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)

	Cassidy, glancing into car, sees Mary, lets out a cheery 
	exclamation, elbows Lowery. Lowery turns, sees Mary, smiles 
	pleasantly, pulls Cassidy on.

	MARY'S CAR - (DAY)

	Mary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror 
	on her face.

	EXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)

	Now we look closely at Lowery. As he reaches the curb, a 
	small confusion brightens his face. He remembers that Mary 
	intended to "spend the weekend in bed." He considers, 
	curiously, turns, looks back at her, a slight frown on his 
	face.

	MARY'S CAR - (DAY)

	Mary sees the pause and the look.

	EXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)

	For a moment it even looks as if Lowery might be meaning to 
	cross back to the car.

	MARY'S CAR - (DAY)

	Mary's tension is unbearable. And at that moment we hear the 
	shrill shriek of the traffic cop's whistle.

	Mary zooms the car away.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY - (DAY)

	Mary in car, driving, safely away from town. Her look is 
	less tense now, and more purposeful. After a moment, she 
	checks the fuel gauge, frowns, looks along highway for a gas 
	station.

								 FAST DISSOLVE TO:

	MARY'S CAR - (DAY)

	Approaching and leaving city limits.

	MARY - (DAY)

	Looks at gas gauge.

	C.U. GAS GAUGE - (DAY)

	EXT. A GAS STATION - (DAY)

	We see Mary's car drive in, come to a stop. There are no 
	other cars about, this being a gas station off the main 
	highway, and the attendant is obviously in the shack. Mary 
	looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face 
	turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen.

	No one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on, as 
	if the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that 
	she should listen to. But the gas registers almost empty. 
	She has to blow her horn.

	A YOUNG MAN comes out of the shack, starts toward her car.

	At that moment, we HEAR the RINGING of the TELEPHONE in the 
	shack. The Attendant walks a few steps further, toward Mary's 
	car, then decides to go back and answer the phone. The phone's 
	insistent ringing unnerves Mary.

	She starts her car, zooms off.

	We see the Attendant, phone in hand, in the doorway of shack. 
	He looks after the departing car with little or no expression.

	CAR

	The car grows smaller as it races up the road. The sun is 
	setting. There is something vaguely ominous about the 
	darkening sky into which the car seems to be disappearing.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	MARY IN CAR - (NIGHT)

	The oncoming headlights hurt Mary's eyes. She is getting 
	sleepy and her vision is blurring. Her eyes close, 
	involuntarily, snap open again. She stretches than wide, as 
	if forcing them to stay open. The oncoming lights seem to 
	glare to a point beyond endurance. She murmurs "Sam - Sam."

								LONG LAP DISSOLVE:

	EXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)

	We see Mary's car, dim in the early dawn, tilted on the soft 
	shoulder of the road, looking somehow sad and pathetic, like 
	a child's thrown-away toy. And from this angle it would appear 
	that the car is empty.

	After a moment, during which there are no other vehicles 
	passing, we see, coming from the far distance, a HIGHWAY 
	PATROLMAN in a patrol car. He passes Mary's car, notes its 
	apparent emptiness, U-turns, comes back up behind the car. 
	He gets out and approaches the driver's side window.

	EXT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)

	The Patrolman looks down into the car.

	INT. CAR (DAWN) FROM HIS VIEWPOINT

	Mary turns with a start, sits up, is startled and unnerved 
	by the sight of the Patrolman, and, as if by automatic reflex, 
	turns the ignition and presses down on the starter.

	EXT. CAR (DAWN)

	The Patrolman holds up his hand.

				PATROLMAN
			(startled)
		Hold it there!

	Mary slams down on the brake, tries to pull herself together. 
	The Patrolman raps again, less gently.

	Reluctantly, Mary rolls down the window. The Patrolman studies 
	her for a moment.

				PATROLMAN
		In quite a hurry.

				MARY
		Yes.
			(because he seems to 
			be awaiting an 
			explanation)
		I didn't mean to sleep so long. I 
		was afraid I'd have an accident last 
		night, from sleepiness... so I decided 
		to pull over...

				PATROLMAN
		You slept here all night?

				MARY
			(a faint edge of 
			defensiveness)
		Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my 
		eyes...

				PATROLMAN
			(mere concern)
		There are plenty of motels in this 
		area. You should have... I mean, 
		just to be safe...

				MARY
		I didn't intend to sleep all night!
		I just pulled over... have I broken 
		any laws?

				PATROLMAN
		No, m'am.

				MARY
		Then I'm free to go...?

				PATROLMAN
			(a pause)
		Is anything wrong?

				MARY
		Of course not! Am I acting as if... 
		something's wrong?

				PATROLMAN
			(almost a smile)
		Frankly, yes.

				MARY
		Please... I'd like to go...

				PATROLMAN
		Is there?

				MARY
		Is there what?
			(not waiting for an 
			answer)
		I've told you there's nothing wrong... 
		except that I'm in a hurry and you're 
		taking up my time...

				PATROLMAN
			(interrupting, sternly)
		Now wait just a moment! Turn your 
		motor off, please.

	Mary seems about to object, thinks better of it, turns off 
	the ignition.

				PATROLMAN
		In the course of my duty, I never 
		"take up" anyone's time, whether 
		it's to give a warning, or a ticket, 
		or help! Believe that, M'am.
			(a little softer)
		Now if you woke up on the wrong side 
		of... the car seat, that's one thing. 
		But when you act as if I've just 
		placed you under arrest...

				MARY
		I'm sorry.

				PATROLMAN
		No need to apologize...

	Mary starts the car, her face turned as if she wishes the 
	matter were all settled and the Patrolman had already gone. 
	The Patrolman isn't exactly one of those civil servants who 
	demands a thank-you, but he does feel her manner is a bit 
	too abrupt. He calls:

				PATROLMAN
		Wait a minute!

				MARY
			(jamming down the 
			brake)
		Now what?

	The Patrolman gazes at her a moment, then:

				PATROLMAN
		May I see your license?

				MARY
		Why?

				PATROLMAN
		Please.

	Mary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she'd placed 
	it when she stretched out for sleep. She puts her hand in 
	it, rummages for her wallet, cannot find it.

	The Patrolman is staring at her. She glances at him nervously, 
	pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, realizes she'll have to 
	remove some of its contents. Nervously, badly controlling 
	her fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, and then 
	the important papers envelope, filled then a couple of other 
	items, places them on the seat, finally finds her wallet, 
	opens it, hands it to him. He looks at the wallet, then at 
	the car.

	EXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)

	The Patrolman walks around to the front of the car, checks 
	the license plate, and returns.

	INT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)

	The Patrolman peers in, checks the car registration on the 
	steering wheel, returns Mary's wallet.

	She takes it, looks at him for a flicker of a moment.

	He says nothing. She starts ahead, fast.

	EXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)

	The Patrolman stares after Mary as she drives off, then starts 
	back to his automobile.

	MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)

	She is quite shaken, realizes she caused herself a great 
	deal of trouble and placed herself in unnecessary danger. 
	She is disturbed and angry and frightened at her inability 
	to act normally under the pressure of guilt. As she drives, 
	she glances into her rear-view mirror.

	MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN)

	The Patrolman is following in his automobile, keeping behind 
	her at a matched speed.

	MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)

	She glances out at her surroundings.

	MARY'S POV - (DAWN)

	The Freeway ahead.

	EXT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)

	She suddenly turns off the highway.

	MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)

	She checks her mirror.

	MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR - (DAWN)

	The Patrolman is no longer following, has not turned off 
	after her.

	MARY IN CAR - (DAWN)

	She breathes a sigh of relief, thinks a moment, makes a quick 
	decision.

							 DISSOLVE:

	EXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

	The big sign reads "California Charlie - Automobile Paradise." 
	We see Mary's car drive onto the lot and stop. Mary gets out 
	of the car, glances toward the lot office, turns her attention 
	to the line of cars, notice the California licence plates on 
	all of them. The CAR DEALER calls out from his office:

				CAR DEALER
		With you in a second!

	Mary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making 
	a selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand 
	on the corner, just outside the lot.

	She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is 
	fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy 
	herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, 
	picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car 
	lot as she glances worried at the front page. As she goes, 
	we see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same 
	PATROLMAN. He sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite 
	side of the street, stops by the curb. Mary, engrossed in 
	the newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see 
	the Patrolman.

	The car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting 
	for Mary. As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles.

				CAR DEALER
		I'm in no mood for trouble!

				MARY
			(glancing up, thrown 
			for a moment)
		What?

				CAR DEALER
			(cheerfully)
		There's an old saying, "First customer 
		of the day is always the most 
		trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no 
		mood for it so I'm just going to 
		treat you so fair and square you 
		won't have one human reason to give 
		me...

				MARY
			(interrupting)
		Can I trade in my car and take 
		another?

				CAR DEALER
		You can do anything you've a mind 
		to... and bein' a woman, you will!
			(chin-indicating her 
			car)
		That yours?

				MARY
		Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, 
		I'm just...

				CAR DEALER
		Sick of the sight of it!
			(laughs)
		Well, suppose you look around for 
		something that strikes your eyes and 
		meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give 
		yours the once over and... want some 
		coffee? I was just about...

				MARY
		No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I 
		just want to make a change and 
		start...

	She stops suddenly, almost with a gasp. She has seen the 
	Patrolman.

	THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)

	He is staring over at her, his face dispassionate.

	EXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

	Mary has to force herself to look away.

				CAR DEALER
		One thing people never ought to be 
		when they're buying a used car is in 
		a hurry!
			(starting away toward 
			her car)
		But like I said, too nice a day for 
		arguing. I'll just shoot this into 
		the garage.

	He starts into Mary's car. She looks at him, in near panic, 
	wanting to skip the whole thing. Torn, wondering if the 
	presence of the Patrolman doesn't negate the value of changing 
	cars, wondering how she can get away, wondering if she'll be 
	followed, or if the Patrolman will go away if she does stay 
	here.

	All these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing. 
	The Car Dealer has driven her car into the garage. She stands 
	in the middle of the lot, feeling like a shooting target. 
	She looks toward the garage.

	THE GARAGE - MARY'S POV - (DAY)

	Mary's car is in it.

	EXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

	Mary decides she cannot back out now without arousing further 
	suspicion, is compelled to look again at the Patrolman.

	THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)

	He still watches. With a self-angry sigh of resignment, she 
	goes to a close car, looks at it. The Car Dealer is returning.

				CAR DEALER
		That's the one I'd've picked for you 
		myself!

				MARY
		How much?

				CAR DEALER
		Go ahead! Spin it around the block. 
		Now I know you don't know anything 
		about engine condition, but you can 
		feel, can't you... and it's all in 
		the feel, believe me, you feel that 
		one around the block...

				MARY
		It looks fine. How much will it be, 
		with my car...?

				CAR DEALER
		You mean you don't want the usual 
		day and a half to think it over?
			(laughs)
		You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' 
		you?

				MARY
		Of course not. Please.

				CAR DEALER
		Well... heck, this is the first time 
		I ever saw the customer high-pressure 
		the salesman!
			(laughs, sees she is 
			in no mood for it)
		I'd figure roughly...
			(looks at the car, 
			then back at the 
			garage)
		...your car plus five hundred.

				MARY
		Five hundred.

				CAR DEALER
		Aha! Always got time to argue money, 
		huh...?

				MARY
		All right.

	As the car dealer looks at her in amazement, she reaches 
	into her bag, feels the money-filled envelope, pauses.

				CAR DEALER
			(slowly)
		I take it... you can prove that car's 
		yours... I mean, out of state and 
		all... got your pink slip and your...

				MARY
		I think I have the necessary papers. 
		Is there a Ladies Room...

				CAR DEALER
		In the building ...
			(indicates, continues 
			to stare quietly)
		Mary starts for the building, glancing 
		once in the direction of the 
		Patrolman.

	THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)

	He still sits, his motor throbbing, his face quiet.

	EXT. THE USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

	Mary goes into the office building.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. LADIES ROOM - (DAY)

	Mary enters, locks door, takes envelope out of her handbag, 
	extracts one bundle of bills from the envelope, counts off 
	five, puts the bundle back into the envelope and the envelope 
	back into the bag. Then she remembers, takes out the important 
	papers envelope, goes through it, finds several papers having 
	to do with her car, takes them all out, puts back the 
	envelope, starts out of the ladies Room.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. THE USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

	The Car Dealer has moved the car of her choice out of the 
	line. It stands in the clearing.

				CAR DEALER
			(too cheerfully)
		I think you'd better give it a trial 
		spin. Don't want any bad word of 
		mouth about California Charlie.

				MARY
		I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't 
		we just settle this and...

				CAR DEALER
		I'll be perfectly honest with you, 
		Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust 
		you, but...

				MARY
			(interrupting)
		But what?  Is there anything so 
		terribly wrong about... making a 
		decision and wanting to hurry? Do 
		you think I've stolen... my car?

				CAR DEALER
		No, M'am. I was only about to say, 
		I've sent my mechanic out to give 
		your car a little test... that's 
		all.

				MARY
			(handing him the 
			ownership papers and 
			the new bills)
		I'd like to be ready when he gets 
		back.

				CAR DEALER
		Okay. If you'll come along...

	He starts toward the office building. Mary follows, closely, 
	anxiously. She glances, sees:

	THE PATROLMAN - MARY'S POV - (DAY)

	He is still at the far curb.

	EXT. USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

	The Car Dealer goes into his office. Mary follows.

	THE PATROLMAN - (DAY)

	A second later, he starts his automobile, checks traffic, 
	comes across the street, slowly, and drives onto the lot. He 
	pauses a moment, then drives across the lot, passing the 
	office, going on to the other exit, stops there as Mary's 
	car is driven back onto the lot.

	The MECHANIC stops Mary's car, hops out, waves to the 
	Patrolman. The Patrolman waves back, goes on a bit until he 
	is behind Mary's car, stops again, looks over at the office. 
	In a moment, Mary comes out, hurries across to her new car, 
	gets in, starts the motor. The Mechanic yells:

				MECHANIC
		Hey! Miss?

	Mary pauses, turns, sees the Patrolman, then the Mechanic. 
	Her face goes white. She doesn't know which man called her. 
	Then the Mechanic waves, starts forward with her suitcase.

				MARY
			(as Mechanic reaches 
			car)
		Just put it right in here, please... 
		beside me.

	The Mechanic smiles, throws the suitcase in. Mary zooms off. 
	As she drives out of lot we see the Mechanic, the Car Dealer 
	and the Patrolman all looking after her.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE

	Mary is driving tensely. She checks the rear-view mirror, is 
	more shocked than pleased when she sees...

	MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR

	No sign of the Patrolman.

	MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE

	She turns her face, looks out at the highway.

	ROUTE 99 - MARY'S POV

	It is heavy with traffic.

	MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE

	Again she checks the mirror and although...

	MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR

	There is still no sign of the Patrolman.

	MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE

	She cannot relax or feel safe, cannot convince herself that 
	nothing will come of the man's watching and suspicions.

	CAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, 
	her fears. Her guilt shines bright in her eyes and she is a 
	person unaccustomed to containing this much guilt in this 
	realistic a situation. Suddenly, we hear the SOUND of the 
	Used Car Dealer's laugh, hear it as clearly as Mary hears it 
	in her imagination. The "imagined voice" we hear is actually 
	the voice of the Car Dealer:

				CAR DEALER'S VOICE
		Heck, Officer, that was the first 
		time I ever saw the Customer high-
		pressure the Salesman!  Somebody 
		chasing her?

				PATROLMAN'S VOICE
		I better have a look at those papers, 
		Charlie.

				CAR DEALER'S VOICE
		She look like a wrong-one to you?

				PATROLMAN'S VOICE
		Acted like one.

	Mary blinks, shakes her head, as if trying to shake away 
	these voices of her imagination. She checks the rear-view 
	mirror.

	MARY'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR

	Still no sight of the Patrolman.

	MARY IN NEW CAR

	She tries to force herself to relax, almost succeeds when 
	she is sprung to tension again by....

	EXT. HIGHWAY

	The sight of a police car. As she drives past, we hear the 
	squeaky, unintelligible voice coming over the car radio. 
	Mary zooms down on the gas, whizzes ahead.

					DISSOLVE THROUGH TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY 99 - LONG SHOT

	Mary's car dashing along.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	MARY IN NEW CAR

	Mary looks weary, tired with strain and with hard driving. 
	Her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought.

	OUT THE WINDSHIELD

	We can see that it is much later in the day, almost dusk.

	MARY IN NEW CAR

	We HEAR the sound of an agitated BUZZ of an intercom system, 
	a sound emanating from Mary's imagination.

	After the second BUZZ, we HEAR the voice of Caroline.

				CAROLINE'S VOICE
		Yes, Mr. Lowery.

				LOWERY'S VOICE
			(a worried tone)
		Caroline...? Mary still isn't in?

				CAROLINE'S VOICE
		No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's 
		always a bit late on Monday mornings.

				LOWERY'S VOICE
		Buzz me the minute she comes in.

	Again Mary shakes her head, forces herself to stop hearing 
	these "invented" scenes of her imagination.

	EXT. HIGHWAY

	Now we cut to the view of the road, from Mary's viewpoint. 
	Darkness of evening is coming. In the dim twilight we see 
	the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations 
	beginning to blaze on.

	INT. MARY'S NEW CAR

	Back on Mary's face, and after a moment, the imagined voices 
	again:

				LOWERY'S VOICE
		Call her sister! If no one's answering 
		at the house....

				CAROLINE'S VOICE
		I called her sister, Mr. Lowery, 
		where she works, the Music Makers 
		Music Store, you know? And she doesn't 
		know where Mary is any more than we 
		do.

				LOWERY'S VOICE
		You better run out to the house.  
		She may be... unable to answer the 
		phone...

				CAROLINE'S VOICE
		Her sister's going to do that.  She's 
		as worried as we are.

	A flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face. 
	She closes her eyes for one tight swift moment.

	EXT. HIGHWAY

	We cut again to the highway. The first oncoming headlights 
	slash at the windshield.

	INT. MARY'S NEW CAR

	Cutting back to Mary, we can sense by the tense muscles of 
	her face that she is driving faster. The oncoming headlights 
	blurt at her.

	Suddenly we HEAR Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as 
	if the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break 
	through Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her 
	imagination blank.

				LOWERY'S VOICE
		No! I haven't the faintest idea.  As 
		I said, I last saw your sister when 
		she left this office on Friday... 
		she said she didn't feel well and 
		wanted to leave early and I said she 
		could. And that was the last I saw...
			(a pause, a thought)
		...wait a minute, I did see her, an 
		hour or so later, driving...
			(a pause, then with 
			solemn fear)
		Ah, I think you'd better come over 
		here to my office. Quick.
			(a pause, a click)
		Caroline, get Mr. Cassidy for me.

	EXT. HIGHWAY

	It is completely dark now, night.

	INT. MARY'S NEW CAR

	We cut back to her face.

				LOWERY'S VOICE
		After all, Cassidy, I told you...  
		all that cash... I'm not taking the 
		responsibility... Oh, for heaven's 
		sake, a girl works for you for ten 
		years, you trust her! All right, 
		yes, you better come over.

	FROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT

	EXT. THE ROAD AHEAD INT. MARY'S NEW CAR

	Fast cut back to Mary's face. Oncoming headlights throw a 
	blinding light across her features.

				CASSIDY'S VOICE
			(undrunk, sharp with 
			rage)
		Well I ain't about to kiss off forty 
		thousand dollars! I'll get it back 
		and if any of it's missin' I'll 
		replace it with her fine soft flesh! 
		I'll track her, never you doubt it!

				LOWERY'S VOICE
		Hold on, Cassidy... I still can't 
		believe... it must be some kind of a 
		mystery... I can't...

				CASSIDY'S VOICE
		You checked with the bank, no?  They 
		never laid eyes on her, no?  You 
		still trustin'? Hot creepers, she 
		sat there while I dumped it out... 
		hardly even looked at it, plannin' 
		and... and even flirtin' with me...!

	A look of revulsion makes Mary close her eyes.

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AGAIN

	Big drops of rain begin to appear.

	CLOSEUP - MARY

	She is becoming aware of the rain starting.

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	The rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights.

	CLOSEUP - MARY

	Mary starts the windshield wipers.

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	The wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain.

	CLOSEUP - MARY

	Peering through the blurred windshield.

	CLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS

	slowing down in the flooding highway.

	CLOSEUP - MARY

	peering through the windshield. The oncoming lights are fewer.

	CLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS

	almost coming to a slow turn.

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	just blackness and rain.

	CLOSEUP - MARY

	peering.

	MARY'S VIEWPOINT

	An almost undiscernible light in the far distance, a neon 
	sign blurred by the rain-sheeted windshield.

	MARY'S CAR

	She presses down, forces the car to move on through the 
	flooded road.

	EXT. THE ROAD

	As we move closer, we see the neon sign more clearly and can 
	faintly make out the large letters which read "Motel."  Mary 
	stops the car, lowers the window slightly, looks out. We see 
	the sign clearly now: "BATES MOTEL." Mary opens the car door 
	and dashes out into the rain and up onto the porch of the 
	motel office.

	EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)

	Mary pauses on the porch. The lights are on within the office. 
	She tries door, finds it open, goes into office. CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS her into office. There is no one present. Mary goes 
	to the desk, rings a small pushbell. There is no response. 
	Mary rubs her forehead in weariness and frustration, goes 
	back out onto the porch. She looks off in another direction, 
	slightly behind the office, and sees...

	MARY'S VIEWPOINT - A LARGE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)

	A path from the motel office leads directly up to this house. 
	There is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms. A WOMAN 
	passes the window, pauses, peers out.

	We see her in clear silhouette. She quickly goes away from 
	the window.

	EXT. PORCH OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)

	Mary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get 
	some attention. She stands a few moments, waiting.

	No one comes. Impatience and anger rise in Mary. She dashes 
	out into the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window, 
	begins to honk the horn. After a moment, a YOUNG MAN open 
	the front door of the house, pauses, starts down the path. 
	After a few steps, he turns and runs back into the house. 
	Mary leaves her car, starts a dash for the shelter of the 
	porch. As she runs, we see that the Young Man has gone back 
	only to get an umbrella. Seeing that Mary is on her way to 
	the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his 
	hand. He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached 
	it.

	He stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging 
	useless in his hand, then back to her.

	There is something sadly touching in his manner, in his look. 
	Mary's impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him 
	almost smile. He gestures her into the office, standing back 
	to indicate that he will go after her. She goes into the 
	office.

	INT. OFFICE OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)

	The Young Man follows Mary in, closes the door. He is NORMAN 
	BATES, somewhere in his late twenties, thin and tall, soft-
	spoken and hesitant.

				NORMAN
		Dirty night.

				MARY
			(not really a question)
		You have a vacancy?

				NORMAN
			(simply, almost 
			cheerfully)
		We have twelve vacancies. Twelve 
		cabins, twelve vacancies.
			(a pause)
		They moved away the highway.

				MARY
		I thought I'd gotten off the main...

				NORMAN
		I knew you must have. No one stops 
		here anymore unless they do.

	He is behind the counter now, pushing forward the registration 
	book.

				NORMAN
		But it's no good dwelling on our 
		losses, is it.  We go right ahead 
		lighting signs and following the 
		formalities...  Would you sign, 
		please.

	Mary has placed her handbag on the counter. She takes the 
	registration book, picks up the pen, is suddenly struck with 
	the realization that she'd better use an alias. She writes 
	the name Marie Samuels.

				NORMAN
		Your home address. Oh, just the town 
		will do.

				MARY
			(glancing at newspaper 
			sticking out of her 
			handbag)
		Los Angeles.

	She realizes he didn't ask her to tell him, merely to write 
	it down. She smiles, writes Los Angeles beside the false 
	name. Norman smiles, stops smiling out of embarrassment.

				NORMAN
		Cabin One. It's closer in case you 
		want anything... right next to the 
		office.

	CLOSEUP - NORMAN

	He removes a key for Cabin One. We see that there is a 
	remaining key on the board.

	TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN

				MARY
		I want sleep more than anything.  
		Except maybe, food.

				NORMAN
		There's a big diner about ten miles 
		on up... just outside Fairvale.

				MARY
		Am I that close to Fairvale?

				NORMAN
		Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

	He goes to door, opens it. The rain has slowed down 
	considerably. He smiles at this fact, as if to communicate 
	some pleasure he finds in it. Mary follows him to the door, 
	goes out on the porch, waits and watches as Norman runs to 
	her car, gets in, drives it to the parking space in front of 
	Cabin One. Mary walks along the porch, waits before the door 
	of Cabin One.

	Norman gets out of car, with suitcase, runs to the door, 
	opens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in and switches 
	on a light. Mary goes into the cabin. Norman follows her.

	INT. CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)

	Norman places suitcase on bed, goes to the window, opens it.

				NORMAN
		Stuffy in here.
			(turns to her)
		Well... the mattress is soft and 
		there're hangers in the closet and... 
		stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed 
		on it in case you want to make your 
		friends back home envious... and... 
		the... over there....
			(he points to the 
			bathroom, fairly 
			blushes)

				MARY
		The bathroom.

				NORMAN
			(quickly, starting to 
			leave)
		I'll be in the office if you want 
		anything... just tap on the wall.

				MARY
		Thank you, Mr. Bates.

				NORMAN
		Norman Bates.

	He pauses at the door, gazes at her. She smiles.

				NORMAN
		You have something most girls never 
		have.

				MARY
		I have?

				NORMAN
		There's no name for it... But it's 
		something that, that puts a person 
		at ease.

				MARY
		Thank you. Again.

				NORMAN
			(not really a question)
		You're not going to go out again and 
		drive up to that diner, are you?

				MARY
		No.

				NORMAN
		Then will you do me a favor?
			(without waiting for 
			her response)
		Will you have supper here?  I was 
		just about to, myself... nothing 
		more than some sandwiches and a lot 
		of milk, but I'd like it if you'd 
		come up to the house and... I don't 
		set a fancy table but... the kitchen's 
		awful homey.

				MARY
		I'd like to.

				NORMAN
		All right, you get your dresses 
		hanging out and... change those wet 
		shoes, and I'll come for you soon as 
		it's ready...
			(starts out)
		...with my trusty umbrella.
			(he laughs a small 
			laugh, runs off)

	Mary closes the door, goes to suitcase, opens it, starts to 
	take out a dress. Her handbag is next to the suitcase. She 
	glances down into it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches into 
	the handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at 
	it, almost with regret, filled contemplates hiding it, decides 
	to, starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. She looks 
	about, at the closet, the drawers etc., realizes all such 
	places are obvious. Catching sight of the newspaper in her 
	bag, she hits on a solution. She opens the newspaper, places 
	the envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again and then 
	places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later 
	reading. She considers this for a moment, accepts it, goes 
	to her suitcase to start unpacking.

	Suddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill, ugly sound of 
	a woman's voice, raised in anger.

				WOMAN'S VOICE
		No! I tell you no!

	Mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible 
	voice is coming from the house behind the cabins. CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS her to window and once there we see the light is 
	still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming 
	from that room. The rain has stopped and the moon is out.

				WOMAN'S VOICE
		I won't have you bringing strange 
		young girls in for supper...
			(an ugly, sneering 
			note creeps into the 
			voice)
		...by candlelight, I suppose, in the 
		cheap erotic fashion of young men 
		with cheap, erotic minds!

				NORMAN'S VOICE
		Mother, please...

				WOMAN'S VOICE
		And then what? After supper, music? 
		Whispers?

				NORMAN'S VOICE
		Mother, she's just a stranger...  
		hungry, and the weather's bad...

				WOMAN'S VOICE
			(mimicking cruelly)
		Mother, she's just a stranger!
			(hard, cruel again)
		As if men don't desire strangers, as 
		if... oh, I refuse to speak of 
		disgusting things because they disgust 
		me! You understand, Boy?

				WOMAN'S VOICE
			(pause)
		Go on, go tell her she'll not be 
		appeasing her ugly appetite with my 
		food... or my son! Or do I have to 
		tell her, cause you don't have the 
		guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, 
		boy?

				NORMAN'S VOICE
			(blurted cut fury and 
			shame)
		Shut up! Shut up!

	There is the SOUND of a door closing in that room up there. 
	Mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress 
	and concern and sympathy. She turns her face away now, gazes 
	sadly at the little empty room.

	In a moment there is the SOUND of the house's front door 
	slamming shut. Mary turns, looks out the window.

	FROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT - (NIGHT)

	We see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered 
	tray.

	INT. CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)

	Mary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to 
	the door, opens it and goes out onto the porch.

	EXT. THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)

	Mary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when 
	Norman comes round the building and walks along the porch, 
	past the office, stopping only when he is close to her. He 
	stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her 
	eye.

				MARY
		I've caused you some trouble.

				NORMAN
		Mother...
			(a hollow little laugh, 
			an attempt at sardonic 
			humor)
		...what is the phrase... "she isn't 
		herself today"... I think that's it.

				MARY
			(looking at the tray)
		You shouldn't have bothered. I really 
		don't have that much of an appetite.

	Norman flinches, realizing she has heard his mother's 
	reference to Mary's appetite.

				NORMAN
		I'm sorry. I wish... people could 
		apologize for other people.

				MARY
		Don't worry about it.
			(a warm smile)
		But as long as you've made us supper, 
		we may as well eat it. Huh?

	She begins to back into her room. Norman starts to follow, 
	hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young 
	woman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in 
	defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his 
	defiance for one day. He cannot go into Mary's room.

				NORMAN
		It might be nicer... warmer in the 
		office.

	Without waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns, hurries 
	to the office. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused 
	sympathy, then follows.

	INT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)

	Norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable 
	place to spread out a supper. He turns, sees Mary standing 
	in the doorway.

				NORMAN
		Eating in an office...
			(a rueful smile)
		...to officious, even for me. I have 
		the parlor behind this... if you'd 
		like.

	Mary nods. Norman walks on, behind the counter and into the 
	darkened parlor. Mary follows.

	INT. NORMAN'S PARLOR -(NIGHT)

	In the darkened room, lit only by the light from the office 
	spilling in, we see Norman placing the tray on a table. Mary 
	comes to the doorway, pauses. Norman straightens up, goes to 
	lamp, turns on the light.

	Mary is startled by the room. Even in the dimness of one 
	lamp, the strange, extraordinary nature of the room rushes 
	up at one. It is a room of birds. Stuffed birds, all over 
	the room, on every available surface, one even clinging to 
	the old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp. The birds are 
	of many varieties, beautiful, grand, horrible, preying. Mary 
	stares in awe and a certain fascinated horror.

	CLOSE UP - THE VARIOUS BIRDS TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN

				NORMAN
		Please sit down. On the sofa.

	As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and 
	pouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room. She studies 
	the birds as she walks, briefly examines a bookcase stacked 
	with books on the subject of "Taxidermy."

	CLOSE UP - THE BOOKS ON TAXIDERMY MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARY

	She notices, too, the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily, 
	and many with a vaguely religious overtone.

	Finally Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread.

				MARY
		You're very... kind.

				NORMAN
		It's all for you. I'm not hungry.  
		Please go ahead.

	Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a 
	small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in 
	the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied.

	Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles 
	and then laughs.

				NORMAN
		You eat like a bird.

				MARY
		You'd know, of course.

				NORMAN
		Not really. I hear that expression, 
		that one eats "like a bird," is really 
		a falsie, I mean a falsity, because 
		birds eat a tremendous lot.
			(A pause, then 
			explaining)
		Oh, I don't know anything about birds. 
		My hobby is stuffing things... 
		taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather 
		stuff birds because...  well, I hate 
		the look of beasts when they're 
		stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... 
		some people even stuff dogs and 
		cats... but I can't... I think only 
		birds look well stuffed because 
		they're rather...  passive, to begin 
		with... most of them...

	He trails off, his exuberance failing in the rushing return 
	of his natural hesitancy and discomfort. Mary looks at him, 
	with some compression, smiles.

				MARY
		It's a strange hobby. Curious, I 
		mean.

				NORMAN
		Uncommon, too.

				MARY
		I imagine so.

				NORMAN
		It's not as expensive as you'd think. 
		Cheap, really. Needles, thread, 
		sawdust .. the chemicals are all 
		that cost anything.
			(He goes quiet, looks 
			disturbed)

				MARY
		A man should have a hobby.

				NORMAN
		It's more than a hobby... sometimes... 
		a hobby is supposed to pass the time, 
		not fill it.

				MARY
			(after a pause, softly)
		Is your time so empty?

				NORMAN
		Oh, no!
			(forcing brightness 
			again)
		I run the office, tend the cabins 
		and grounds, do little chores for 
		mother... the ones she allows I might 
		be capable of doing.

				MARY
		You go out... with friends?

				NORMAN
		Friends? Who needs friends.
			(Laughs, then with 
			gallows humor)
		A boy's best friend is his mother.
			(Stops laughing)
		You've never had an empty moment in 
		your whole life. Have you?

				MARY
		Only my share.

				NORMAN
		Where are you going? I don't mean to 
		pry...

				MARY
			(A wistful smile)
		I'm looking for a private island.

				NORMAN
		What are you running away from?

				MARY
			(Alert)
		Why do you ask that?

				NORMAN
		No. People never run away from 
		anything.
			(A pause)
		The rain didn't last very long.
			(Turning suddenly)
		You know what I think? I think we're 
		all in our private traps, clamped in 
		them, and none of us can ever climb 
		out. We scratch and claw... but only 
		at the air, only at each other, and 
		for all of it, we never budge an 
		inch.

				MARY
		Sometimes we deliberately step into 
		those traps.

				NORMAN
		I was born in mine. I don't mind it 
		anymore.

				MARY
		You should... mind it.

				NORMAN
		Oh I do... but I say I don't.
			(Laughs boyishly)

				MARY
			(Staring at him, 
			shaking her head 
			softly.)
		If anyone ever spoke to me, the way 
		I heard... The way she spoke to you, 
		I don't think I could ever laugh 
		again.

				NORMAN
			(Controlled resentment)
		Sometimes when she talks that way to 
		me I'd like to... curse her out and 
		leave her forever!
			(A rueful smile)
		Or at least, defy her.
			(A pause, a hopeless 
			shrug)
		But I couldn't. She's ill.

				MARY
		She sounded strong...

				NORMAN
		I mean... ill.
			(A pause)
		She had to raise me all by herself 
		after my dad died... I was only 
		five... and it must have been a 
		strain. Oh, she didn't have to go 
		out to work or anything, Dad left us 
		with a little something... anyway, a 
		few years ago... Mother met a man. 
		He talked her into building this 
		motel... We could have talked her 
		into anything... and when.  Well... 
		It was just too much for her when he 
		died, too... And the way he died... 
		Oh, it's nothing to talk about when 
		you're eating.
			(Pauses, smiles)
		Anyway, it was too much of a loss 
		for my mother... she had nothing 
		left.

				MARY
			(Critically)
		Except you.

				NORMAN
		A son is a poor substitute for a 
		lover.
			(Turns away as if in 
			distaste of the word)

				MARY
		Why don't you go away?

				NORMAN
		To a private island, like you?

				MARY
		No, not like me.

				NORMAN
		It's too late for me. And besides... 
		who'd look after her? She'd be alone 
		up there, the fire would go out... 
		damp and cold, like a grave. When 
		you love someone, you don't do that 
		to them, even if you hate them. Oh, 
		I don't hate her.  I hate... what 
		she's become. I hate... the illness.

				MARY
			(Slowly, carefully)
		Wouldn't it be better if you put her 
		in... someplace...

	She hesitates. Norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a 
	striking coldness.

				NORMAN
		An Institution? A madhouse?  People 
		always call a madhouse "someplace."
			(Mimicing coldly)
		Put her in Someplace!

				MARY
		I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to 
		sound uncaring...

				NORMAN
			(The coldness turning 
			to tight fury)
		What do you mean about caring?  Have 
		you ever seen one of those places? 
		Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel 
		eyes studying you... and my mother 
		there?  Why? has she harmed you?  
		She's as harmless as... one of these 
		stuffed birds.

				MARY
		I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed 
		she was harming you. I meant...

				NORMAN
			(High fury now)
		Well? You meant well?  People always 
		mean well, they cluck their thick 
		tongues and shake their heads and 
		suggest so very delicately that...

	The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks 
	back into his chair. There is a brief silence.

	Mary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained 
	by his anguish.

				NORMAN
			(Quietly)
		I've suggested it myself. But I hate 
		to even think such a thing.  She 
		needs me... and it isn't...
			(Looks up with a 
			childlike pleading 
			in his eyes)
		...it isn't as if she were a maniac, 
		a raving thing... it's just that... 
		sometimes she goes a little mad. We 
		all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't 
		you?

				MARY
			(After a long 
			thoughtful pause)
		Yes, and just one time can be enough.
			(Rises)
		Thank you.

				NORMAN
			(Cheerfully, correcting)
		Thank you, Norman.

				MARY
		Norman.

				NORMAN
		You're not going to... to your room 
		already?

				MARY
		I'm very tired. And I'll have a long 
		drive tomorrow. All the way back to 
		Phoenix.

				NORMAN
		Phoenix?

				MARY
		I stepped into a private trap back 
		there -- and I want to go back and... 
		try to pull myself out.
			(Looking close at 
			Norman)
		Before it's too late for me, too.

				NORMAN
			(Looking at her)
		Why don't you stay a little while, 
		just for talking.

				MARY
		I'd like to, but...

				NORMAN
		Alright. I'll see you in the morning. 
		I'll bring you breakfast.  What time 
		will you...

				MARY
		Very early. Dawn.

				NORMAN
		Alright, Miss...
			(He has forgotten her 
			name)

				MARY
		Crane.

				NORMAN
		That's it.
			(He frowns, as if 
			bothered by not being 
			able to match the 
			name to the memory 
			of the name in the 
			registration book)

				MARY
		Good night.

	She goes out of the parlor. We see her, from Norman's 
	viewpoint, as she crosses the small office, goes out into 
	the night. Norman turns and looks at the table, and we see 
	his face now. It is bright with that drunken-like look of 
	determination and encouragement and like resolve. He starts 
	to clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of 
	Mary's door in the cabin next door.

	He holds still, listens. He goes into the office and looks 
	at the book.

	C.U. - THE NAME "SAMUELS"

	M.S. - NORMAN

	He goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression. 
	The sound of Mary moving about her room come over, soft 
	SOUNDS, somehow intimate in the night quiet. Norman turns 
	his ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting 
	an impulse to listen, or more than listen.

	But slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and, 
	resisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of 
	his head against it. The SOUNDS come louder, as if we too 
	had our ear pressed against the wall. Now Norman looks at a 
	picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning 
	against. Slowly he starts toward it.

	He reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame 
	off the wall.

	A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the 
	hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is 
	very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light 
	striking Norman's face.

	We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile 
	fills the screen. The tiny spot of light hits his eye. See 
	the small hole through which the light comes. Norman peeps 
	through.

	NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT

	Through the hole we look into Mary's cabin, see Mary 
	undressing. She is in her bra and halfslip. She stoops over 
	a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, begins to 
	unhook her bra.

	NORMAN - ECU

	He watches as Mary removes her bra. We see his eye run up 
	and down the unseen figure of Mary.

	NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT

	Mary, just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity.

	NORMAN

	He turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues 
	turning until he can look out the small parlor window.

	We see, as he sees...

	THE HOUSE IN THE BACKGROUND

	NORMAN

	He turns his face away, quickly, resentfully. In his face we 
	see anger and anguish. And then resolve.

	Quickly, precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in 
	the wall, turns, starts out of the parlor. We see him go 
	through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering 
	to close the door behind him.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. THE MOTEL OFFICE PORCH - (NIGHT)

	Norman walking along the porch, in the direction of the big 
	house. Once on the path he pauses, looks up at the light in 
	the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his 
	shoulders, strides manfully up the path.

	CAMERA follows behind him. He opens the door of the house, 
	enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, look 
	up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He 
	holds for a moment, and then his resolve and courage 
	evaporates. His shoulders slump, sadly, mournfully. He by-
	passes the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen. 
	At the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen, drops 
	wearily into a chair. After a moment, he stretches out a leg 
	and gently pushes the kitchen door closed.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. MARY'S MOTEL ROOM - (NIGHT)

	Mary is seated at the small desk, engrossed in figuring in a 
	small notebook. We see from these figures a calculation which 
	indicates her intention to make a restitution of the money 
	she has used of the forty thousand dollars. We see, too, her 
	bankbook. The paper reads thus: top figure, 40,000; directly 
	beneath it 500, the amount used for the new car; total after 
	subtraction, 39,500. In another spot we see a figure which 
	matches the balance in her bankbook; 624.00.

	Beneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after 
	subtraction, 124.00. She studies the figures, sighs, not 
	wearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure 
	that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to 
	continue doing the right thing. After a moment she tears the 
	page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into 
	small pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces 
	into the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet. Then she drops her 
	robe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on.

	INT. MARY IN SHOWER

	Over the bar on which hangs the shower curtain, we can see 
	the bathroom door, not entirely closed. For a moment we watch 
	Mary as she washes and soaps herself.

	There is still a small worry in her eyes, but generally she 
	looks somewhat relieved.

	Now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open.

	The noise of the shower drowns out any sound. The door is 
	then slowly and carefully closed.

	And we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower 
	curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. The white 
	brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding.

	Suddenly we see the hand reach up, grasp the shower curtain, 
	rip it aside.

							 CUT TO:

	MARY - ECU

	As she turns in response to the feel and SOUND of the shower 
	curtain being torn aside. A look of pure horror erupts in 
	her face. A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her 
	throat. A hand comes into the shot. The hand holds an enormous 
	bread knife. The flint of the blade shatters the screen to 
	an almost total, silver blankness.

	THE SLASHING

	An impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very 
	screen, ripping the film. Over it the brief gulps of 
	screaming. And then silence. And then the dreadful thump as 
	Mary's body falls in the tub.

	REVERSE ANGLE

	The blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand 
	pulling the shower curtain back. We catch one flicker of a 
	glimpse of the murderer. A woman, her face contorted with 
	madness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a 
	fright-wig.  And then we see only the curtain, closed across 
	the tub, and hear the rush of the shower water. Above the 
	shower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a 
	moment we HEAR the SOUND of the front door slamming.

							 CUT TO:

	THE DEAD BODY

	Lying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over, 
	touching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if 
	popped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor.  
	Coming down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along 
	the porcelain, we see many small threads of blood. CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the 
	bathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom. As CAMERA 
	approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed 
	it on the bedside table.

	CLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER

	beside the bed. The CAMERA now moves away over to the window 
	and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, 
	coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, 
	shocked voice.

				NORMAN'S VOICE
		Mother! Oh God, what... blood, 
		blood... mother...!

	We cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations.

	After a moment or two of silence, Norman emerges from the 
	front door, dashes down the path toward the motel.

						QUICK CUT TO:

	EXT. THE PATH - (NIGHT)

	Norman is coming AT CAMERA, running head-on. He dashes into 
	an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in 
	his face. CAMERA PANS as Norman races past, holds as Norman 
	runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Mary's 
	room.

	INT. MARY'S CABIN - (NIGHT)

	Norman pauses a moment in the doorway, glances about the 
	room, hears the shower going, sees the bathroom door is open. 
	He goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body.

	Slowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face, 
	covers his eyes, turns his face away. Then he crosses to the 
	window, looks out at the house. Shot is so angled that we 
	see the bedside table with the newspaper on it.

	After a moment, Norman moves from the window, sinks onto the 
	edge of the bed.

	FRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN

	Norman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot. We can 
	see only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile 
	floor. Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of 
	his dilemma. Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the 
	peace that comes with decision.

	Norman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with 
	resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across 
	it. Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch, 
	and draws those curtains closed. Then he switches off the 
	bedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from 
	the bathroom. He opens the front door, goes out.

	EXT. THE HOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)

	Norman comes out of Mary's cabin, closes the door carefully 
	behind him, goes along the porch to his office, goes in. We 
	stay outside. Immediately, the "Vacancy" sign goes off, and 
	then the motel sign goes off. As CAMERA GOES closer to the 
	office, the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door 
	opening and then the SOUND of a pail being picked up. Norman 
	comes out of office, closes door, looks cautiously about, 
	goes along porch, carrying pail with mop in it, goes into 
	Mary's cabin, closing the door after him.

	INT. MARY'S CABIN

	With the paper in the foreground, Norman enters. We can see 
	him in the dim spill of light. He pauses by the door, then 
	gathers his strength and goes into the bathroom. We HEAR him 
	set the pail on the tiled floor, and then we HEAR the shower 
	being turned off. And there is total silence. CAMERA MOVES 
	FORWARD so that we can see into bathroom.

	CAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up. 
	Quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges 
	with it into the bedroom. CAMERA PANS down and we see him 
	spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside 
	the bathroom door. He spreads the curtain so that one end of 
	it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over 
	and onto the tile floor. Again he goes into the bathroom and 
	CAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman. 
	He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his 
	body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it 
	across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain 
	in the bedroom. Having arranged the body, he straightens up, 
	examines his hands, sees bloodstains on them. He returns to 
	the bathroom, goes to the hand-basin.

	CLOSE SHOT

	We see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being 
	diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water.

	NORMAN

	We see Norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn 
	to the job of cleaning the bathroom.

	He places the pail in the tub, runs water into it, dips the 
	mop in, swabs the tile floor. With a towel he wipes off the 
	wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and 
	even the shower curtain rod. Then he takes a second towel 
	and goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them.  
	Finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail, 
	cleans out the tub, and goes out into the bedroom.

	INT. MARY'S BEDROOM

	Norman steps carefully around the unseen body, crosses to 
	the desk, starts going through Mary's handbag, in search of 
	her car keys. He suddenly notices them lying on the desk, 
	where he'd thrown them after parking her car. He picks up 
	the keys, crosses the room, goes out.

	EXT. THE PORCH

	We see Norman pauses at the door, check cautiously, then 
	hurry across the porch and into Mary's car. He circle-turns 
	the car, so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch, 
	directly opposite Mary's door, as close as it can go.

	Then he alights, goes to the trunk, opens it with the key 
	and, leaving the trunk lid raised, goes back into the cabin.

	INT. MARY'S ROOM

	From a raised angle, we see Norman bend down and begin to 
	wrap the shower curtain around the body. We see the edges of 
	the curtain as they are raised and laid down again. Then he 
	picks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his 
	foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind 
	him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body 
	in the trunk. He closes the lid then, but does not lock it. 
	He comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely, 
	flicks on the light.

	Again the newspaper is in the foreground. For a moment he 
	pauses, closes his eyes against the realization of what he 
	is doing, then quickly pushes all thoughts away, continues 
	with his work. With the room lighted, he now proceeds to 
	gather up all Mary's articles and toss them into the suitcase. 
	He checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks 
	under bed and bureau, goes into the bathroom, checks that 
	room again, comes back into the bedroom, looks about 
	carefully, spots Mary's handbag, throws even that into the 
	suitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl 
	are gone from the room. Then he closes Mary's suitcase, picks 
	it up.

	With his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the 
	mop and the used towels. He crosses to the door, switches 
	off the light with his shoulder, pulls open the door, starts 
	out.

	EXT. THE PORCH

	As Norman stands in the doorway, he is suddenly and blindingly 
	lit by the bright headlights of a passing car. The flash of 
	the lights and the SOUND of the SPEEDING CAR are over in a 
	flicker of a moment, but it takes a few seconds for Norman 
	to regain his former tense composure. Then he goes to the 
	car trunk, raises it with his foot, throws the suitcase and 
	the pail into it, slams it shut. He pauses a moment, then 
	realizes he has left the bathroom light on in Mary's cabin. 
	He returns to cabin. As he enters, his eye is caught by the 
	newspaper on the bedside table. He goes to it, takes the 
	newspaper, and looks once again into the bathroom. His glance 
	goes right over the toilet bowl.

	He turns out the lights, crosses the darkened cabin, goes 
	out onto the porch.

	He reopens the trunk, tosses in the newspaper and closes it. 
	He goes around and jumps into the car and starts away.

	We HOLD on the trunk, follow it for a while, then

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)

	The car pulls away from a CLOSE ANGLE on the trunk and as 
	CAMERA HOLDS we see that we are now in a swamp area.

	It is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects. 
	Norman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp, turns 
	off the lights, gets out, leaving door open. He looks at the 
	swamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car, 
	realizes he has no choice. He leans into the car, releases 
	the emergency brake, starts to push. The front of the car 
	begins to roll into the swamp. Suddenly there is the LOW, 
	THROBBING SOUND of a motor. Norman freezes, listens.

	The SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane 
	flying overhead. The car is rolling quickly now. Norman jumps 
	away, slams the door shut, stands tense. The SOUND of the 
	plane overhead grows louder.

	Norman looks up.

	NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT - THE BLACK SKY

	We see no plane. The SOUND of the motor is beginning to 
	diminish.

						 CUT BACK TO:

	NORMAN

	We see the relief in his face. He looks at the car.

	More than two-thirds of it have already sunk into the swamp. 
	The trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime, 
	as if refusing to go the rest of the way. Norman begins to 
	panic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot. And 
	slowly the car sinks, until finally it is gone and we hear 
	only the gentle plop of the swamp's final gulp, and see only 
	the small after-bubble, like a visual burp.

	Norman waits a moment, then begins stamping out the tire 
	marks, so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp.

	He stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we:

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	CLOSE UP NORMAN

	standing on the porch of the motel, leaning against a post. 
	He is staring out into the night, a look of guarded, casual 
	innocence on his face, as if he were taking one last moment 
	of peaceful night air before retiring. Then he glances down 
	and CAMERA follows his gaze. A hose is lying on the ground 
	outside Mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the 
	tire marks.

	After a moment, Norman's hand comes into shot, picks up hose, 
	places it in a new position. As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see 
	that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the 
	road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a 
	car had been parked here.

	After a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it 
	off, unscrews the hose. As he rolls the hose, he walks away 
	from the spot, past the office, heading for the path that 
	leads to the house. He goes up the path, pauses at the steps 
	of the house, tosses the curled hose onto the lawn, goes up 
	the steps and into the house. CAMERA FOLLOWS him in, PAUSES 
	as he pauses at the foot of the stairs. Norman goes up the 
	stairs.

	On the landing he stops. The door to his mother's room is 
	closed. Lying in a heap outside the door are a blood-stained 
	dress and a pair of elderly-woman's shoes. From an EXTREMELY 
	HIGH ANGLE, we look down on Norman as he bends to pick up 
	the stained dress and shoes.

	He rolls the shoes into the dress, tucks the small, neat 
	bundle under his arm, and starts down the stairs, heading 
	for the basement.

	EXT. A LONG SHOT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)

	It stands silhouetted against the sky. There is a long wait. 
	Then, slowly, a curl of smoke comes out of the chimney.

							 FADE OUT:

							 FADE IN

	INT. BACK ROOM OF SAM'S HARDWARE STORE IN FAIRVALE - (DAY)

	Sam is seated at his desk, writing a letter. Sequence

	begins with CAMERA IN CLOSE, over Sam's shoulder, and we can 
	read as mush as he has written of the letter. The letterhead 
	reads "Sam Loomis - Hardware," and the letter reads: "Dearest 
	right-as-always Mary: I'm sitting in this tiny back room 
	which isn't big enough for both of us, and suddenly it looks 
	big enough for both of us. So what if we're poor and cramped 
	and miserable, at least we'll be happy! If you haven't come 
	to your senses, and still want to...

	CAMERA begins PULLING AWAY as Sam turns the sheet of paper 
	over, continues backing away out of the small back room and 
	heads, backwards, down the corridor, we see a young clerk, 
	BOB SUMMERFIELD, Sam's assistant, standing behind the counter, 
	a look of handsome patience on his face. He is waiting on a 
	meticulous, elderly woman customer, who is holding and 
	examining a large can of insecticide. As CAMERA PASSES:

				WOMAN CUSTOMER
		...They tell you what its ingredients 
		are and how it's guaranteed to 
		exterminate any insect in the world, 
		but they do not tell you whether or 
		not it's painless. And I say insect 
		or man, death should always be 
		painless.

	CAMERA, by this has reached the front door of the hardware 
	store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door. 
	She is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a 
	look of purposefulness. She carries a handbag and a small 
	overnight case. She is Mary's sister, LILA CRANE.

	Bob Summerfield has noticed Lila, smiles brightly at her, 
	gives her an I'll-be-with-you-in-a-moment nod.

	Lila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her 
	eyes off Bob. As she approaches, she asks quietly:

				LILA
		Sam?

				SUMMERFIELD
		You want to see Sam?

				LILA
		Sam Loomis.

				SUMMERFIELD
			(yelling toward back 
			room)
		Sam! Lady wants to see you!

	Lila looks to the back room. The woman customer goes on 
	worriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can. 
	Sam comes to the door of his room, pauses, looks at Lila a 
	moment, starts toward her, his expression indicating that he 
	does not know her. Lila studies him with a quiet, worried 
	expression.

				SAM
		Yes?

				LILA
		May I talk to you?

				SAM
			(a bit mystified)
		Sure...

	Lila glances at the customer and the clerk, turns, starts 
	toward the front of the store. Sam holds a moment, then 
	follows. As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him 
	intently as she says:

				LILA
		I'm Mary's sister.

				SAM
		Lila.

				LILA
			(quickly)
		Is Mary here?

	Sam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile 
	expression on Lila's face. He studies her for a quiet moment. 
	Behind them is a display of various size carving knives.

				SAM
		Is something wrong?

				LILA
		I want to know if my sister is here.

				SAM
		Here?

				LILA
		With you.

				SAM
		Where?

				LILA
		I don't know where. In your store, 
		somewhere in your town... anywhere.

				SAM
		What's the matter?

				LILA
		Don't you know?

	As Sam is about to speak, the Woman Customer comes sailing 
	past, speaking as she goes and wearing a satisfied smile.

				WOMAN CUSTOMER
		All I can do is hope if it isn't 
		painless, it's quick!

	She speaks "quick" with a kind of delicious bite, nods 
	happily, goes on out of the store. Sam is now staring 
	apprehensively at Lila.

				SAM
		What should I know?

				LILA
		To begin with, where Mary is. Do 
		you?

				SAM
		No. I take it you don't either?
			(As Lila shakes her 
			head)
		How long?

				LILA
		Last Friday. She left work, and 
		home... I was in Tucson over the 
		weekend... I haven't heard from her, 
		not even a phone call.

				SAM
		And you thought she'd come up here, 
		to me? If she had, what reason would 
		she have for not calling you?

				LILA
		A good reason, I suppose.

				SAM
			(Slightly exasperated)
		Well what do you think, we eloped or 
		something? Or we're living in sin 
		and...

				LILA
		Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being 
		defensive that you haven't even 
		reacted to the most serious fact of 
		all. Mary is missing.

				SAM
		I was getting to that!

				LILA
		What do you know about it?

				SAM
		Nothing! You're putting me on the 
		defensive.

				LILA
		Look, if you two are in this thing 
		together, I don't care, it's none of 
		my business... But I want to see 
		Mary. I want her to tell me she's 
		all right and it's none of my 
		business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix 
		and...

	She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes 
	beginning to fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a 
	moment, then turns and calls:

				SAM
		Bob? Run out and get yourself some 
		lunch.

				SUMMERFIELD
		It's okay, Sam, I brought it with 
		me.

				SAM
		Run out and eat it.

	Bob gets the message, goes out through the back way.

	Sam goes closer to Lila, speaks with soft seriousness.

				SAM
		What thing?

				LILA
		Huh?

				SAM
		What thing could we be in together?

				LILA
			(A pause)
		I hate tears.
			(Takes out hankie)

				SAM
		Is Mary... in trouble?

				LILA
		Yes.

				SAM
		Well why didn't she come to me...  
		call me...?

				LILA
		Not that kind...
			(Almost a smile)
		You men and your egos.

				SAM
			(Seriously)
		Never mind my ego. Let's talk about 
		Mary.

	Their attention is distracted by a man who has strolled 
	quietly into the room. He ignores them, walks past them, 
	goes behind the counter, takes down a sign reading "CLOSED 
	FOR LUNCH," walks back to the door, closes door, hangs the 
	sign across the door window, locks the door, turns to Sam 
	and Lila, folds his arms, smiles a particularly unfriendly 
	smile.

				ARBOGAST
		Let's all talk about Mary.

				SAM
		Who are you, friend?

				ARBOGAST
		Milt Arbogast, Private Investigator.
			(To Lila)
		Where is she, Miss Crane?

				LILA
		I don't know.

				ARBOGAST
		Wouldn't have been able to tail you 
		if you did.

				SAM
		What's your interest?

				ARBOGAST
		Money.

	There is a moment's silence and then, unable to tolerate the 
	sudden frightening happenings, Sam explodes.

				SAM
		Somebody better tell me what's going 
		on and tell me fast! I can take so 
		much and then...

				ARBOGAST
			(Interrupting calmly)
		Your girl friend stole forty thousand 
		dollars.

	Sam looks at Arbogast in utter shock and in that state asks 
	one of those seemingly ridiculous questions.

				SAM
		Why?

				ARBOGAST
			(An almost amused 
			smile)
		Must've needed it.

				SAM
		What are you talking about?
			(To Lila)
		What is this?

				LILA
		She was supposed to bank it, on 
		Friday, for her boss. She didn't.

	And no one has seen her since.

				ARBOGAST
			(Looking at Sam)
		Someone has seen her. Someone always 
		sees a girl with forty thousand 
		dollars.
			(To Sam)
		She is your girl friend, isn't she?

				LILA
		Sam, they don't want to prosecute, 
		they just want the money back. It 
		was all in cash...

				ARBOGAST
			(Correcting with 
			Cassidy's word)
		Casharoonie!

				LILA
		Sam, if she's here...

				SAM
		She isn't!

	A real look of anguish comes into Lila's face. And Arbogast 
	studies it, then speaks.

				ARBOGAST
		You came up here on a hunch, Miss 
		Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... 
		from him, or from your sister herself?

				LILA
			(wearily)
		Not even a hunch. Just hope.

				ARBOGAST
		With a little checking, I could get 
		to believe you.

				LILA
			(anxiously)
		I don't care if you do or... I want 
		to see Mary... before she gets in 
		any deeper...

				SAM
		Did you check in Phoenix... 
		hospitals... maybe she had an 
		accident... a hold-up...

				ARBOGAST
		She was seen leaving town in her 
		car. Seen by her very victims, I 
		might add.

				SAM
			(after a moment)
		I don't believe it.
			(to Lila, slowly)
		Do you?

				LILA
			(a thoughtful pause)
		Yes... I just... did. The moment 
		they told me...

				SAM
		You might have doubted for say five 
		minutes or so, Sister.

	Lila turns from Sam, a flush of guilt and regret in her face. 
	Arbogast looks at her, quiet sympathetically.

				ARBOGAST
		We're always quickest to doubt people 
		who have a record for being honest.  
		I think she's here, Miss Crane. Where 
		there's a boyfriend...
			(Trails off, smiles 
			encouragingly)
		She won't be back there among the 
		nuts and bolts... but she'll be in 
		this town... somewhere. I'll find 
		her.

	He nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, sails it to 
	the counter, opens door, goes out into the street.

	After a quiet moment:

				LILA
		I just listened... and believed 
		everything they told me. 'She stole 
		the money.' 'We don't want to get 
		her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the 
		police in'...

				SAM
		It was her boss' idea not to report 
		it to the police?

				LILA
		No. The man whose money she... he 
		talked so loud and fast, and I... I 
		should've called the police.

				SAM
		He must have had a darn good reason 
		for wanting them kept out of it...  
		All that cash...

				LILA
		I ought to call the police right 
		now!

				SAM
		No.

				LILA
		Why not? Sam, is she hiding here?  
		Are you two planning to go away with 
		the money?

				SAM
		How could I go away? I'm in debt up 
		to my...
			(Smiles at the 
			incongruity of his 
			reply, then goes 
			serious)
		If she did steal that money...  It's 
		hard to believe she did because it's 
		hard to see why she would. Unless 
		she had some wild idea that it would 
		help me... us...

				LILA
		She haven't even called you?

				SAM
		I didn't see her... and I didn't 
		hear from her! Believe that!

				LILA
		I need to... I need to believe 
		something. This is the first time 
		I've ever come up against anything I 
		couldn't... understand.

				SAM
		You've led a charmed life.

				LILA
		No. I just think... anything can be 
		explained. But Mary, doing a thing 
		like this... I don't know how to 
		handle...

				SAM
		Maybe we can handle it together.
			(He smiles 
			encouragingly)

				LILA
			(A rueful shrug)
		I came flying up here expecting to 
		get some explanation... for all I 
		know, she may be trying to get in 
		touch with me, at home. I'd better 
		go home.

				SAM
			(A thoughtful pause)
		I think she'll contact me if she 
		contacts anybody. Why don't you stay 
		here. When she shows up... or calls... 
		be here.

				LILA
			(A long study, her 
			suspicion of him 
			evaporating)
		You want me to stay here?

				SAM
		She'll need both of us.

				LILA
			(considers, then:)
		Where... can I stay?

				SAM
			(brightly)
		First rate hotel, fifty yards up the 
		street. Come on.
			(as he reaches for 
			the closed-for-lunch 
			sign)
		After we check you in we'll go to 
		the drugstore and get you a sandwich. 
		Then we'll come back here... and 
		wait.

	He hangs the sign on the door, ushers Lila out, closes door 
	behind him.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - (DAY)

	They emerge from the store and walk along to the hotel.  As 
	they enter, Arbogast is in the act of taking over a white 
	Ford sedan from a rental car man. They glance at him and he 
	returns a cynical look.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HOTEL - (DAY)

	Outside another hotel we see Arbogast alight from the white 
	car and go into new hotel.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - (DAY)

	The white car speeding along the highway.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. NEW MOTEL - (DAY)

	Arbogast going into the office - we see the sign above him.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)

	A high shot showing the freeway and Bates house and motel on 
	the side old highway. A pause and then across the bottom of 
	the picture a white car speeds by on the freeway.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HOTEL - (DUSK)

	Another Hotel. Arbogast goes in.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)

	The white car speeding along the freeway again going in the 
	opposite direction to last time. Norman, a tiny figure, is 
	seen going up the steps to his mother's house.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - (DAY)

	Arbogast's search is getting down in the scale. This is an 
	entrance to a cheesy boarding house. "Rooms to Rent," etc. 
	He looks at his list and then goes in.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (DAY)

	The white car goes by on the freeway again.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - (DAY)

	Arbogast goes in.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (TWILIGHT)

	Heavy traffic on the freeway. A beat or two - again the white 
	car. It slows up opposite the distant motel. It makes a turn 
	and goes back out of scene. A pause and it reappears on the 
	old road and slowly makes its way toward the Bates' Motel.

	EXT. THE BATES' HOUSE AND MOTEL - (TWILIGHT)

	We now see Norman. He has brought out an old rocking chair 
	and has placed it on the office porch and is sitting hunched 
	in it. And he is darning one of his own socks. CAMERA HOLDS. 
	Beyond the porch, and Norman, we see the old house and can 
	barely make out, in the twilight dimness, the figure of his 
	mother seated at the window. Here, too, there is that quality 
	of quiet peace surrounded by a vague foreboding.

	Now Norman looks up at the SOUND of the approaching car.

	And continues looking as the car comes to a stop and Arbogast 
	gets out. Arbogast gives the place a quick once-over, gazes 
	at Norman, starts forward. In his steps and manner there is 
	that bored, routine-logged quality of a man who has seen too 
	many motels and asked question of too many hotel managers 
	over too short a period of time.

	Norman rises as Arbogast comes forward.

				NORMAN
			(shoving sock in his 
			pocket)
		I always forget to put the sign on, 
		but we do have vacancy.
			(Cheerfully)
		Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve 
		vacancies.

				ARBOGAST
			(pleasantly)
		In the past two days I've been to so 
		many motels, my eyes are bleary with 
		neon. This is the first one that 
		looked like it was hiding from the 
		world at large.

				NORMAN
		I don't really forget the sign, it 
		just doesn't seem... any use.
			(Points)
		This used to be the main highway.
			(Starts for office)
		Want to register, please?

				ARBOGAST
		Sit down. I don't want to trouble 
		you, just want to ask...

				NORMAN
		No trouble. Today's linen day. I 
		change all the beds once a week, 
		whether they've been used or not... 
		dampness. I hate the smell of 
		dampness.
			(Opening office door)
		It's such a dank smell.

	Norman is holding the door open, so Arbogast walks in.

	Norman follows.

	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - (TWILIGHT)

	Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen 
	closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has 
	remained standing by the door.

				NORMAN
		You out to buy a motel?

				ARBOGAST
		No.

				NORMAN
		Oh. I thought... you said you'd been 
		to so many in two days...  What was 
		it you wanted to ask?

				ARBOGAST
		I'm looking for a missing person.
			(takes out and opens 
			wallet and extends 
			it as he speaks)
		My name's Arbogast, private 
		investigator...
			(takes back wallet 
			when Norman doesn't 
			look at it)
		Trying to trace a young girl who's 
		been missing almost a week. From 
		Phoenix.
			(A look at Norman's 
			frightened expression)
		It's a private matter... family wants 
		to forgive her...
			(smiles)
		She isn't in trouble.

				NORMAN
			(forcing a smile)
		I didn't think the police went 
		searching for people who weren't in 
		trouble.

				ARBOGAST
		I'm not the police.

				NORMAN
		Oh.

	He waits a moment, then opens closet, starts counting out 
	sheets and pillow cases, keeps his back to Arbogast.

	Arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talks as he 
	crosses to Norman.

				ARBOGAST
		We have reason to believe she came 
		this way... might have stopped in 
		this area...
			(extends photograph, 
			which Norman doesn't 
			glance at)
		Did she stop here?

				NORMAN
		No. No one has stopped here in 
		weeks...

				ARBOGAST
		Mind looking at the picture before 
		committing yourself?

				NORMAN
		Committing myself to what? You sure 
		talk like a Policeman.

				ARBOGAST
		Look at the picture. Please.

	Norman glances, briefly, turns away, lifts sheets and pillow 
	cases off the shelf holds them close, almost protectively.

				NORMAN
		No. At least I don't recall.

				ARBOGAST
		She might have used an alias. Mary 
		Crane's the real name, but she 
		might've registered...

				NORMAN
			(interrupting)
		I don't even bother with guests 
		registering any more... I mean, little 
		by little, you drop the formalities.
			(more relaxed, because 
			Arbogast is listening 
			with a pleasant smile)
		I shouldn't even bother to change 
		the linen. I guess habits die hard. 
		Which reminds me...

	He goes to the wall, flips a light switch.

				NORMAN
		The vacancy sign. Just in case.

	We had a couple the other night, said if the sign hasn't 
	been on they'd have thought this was an old deserted mining 
	town or something.

				ARBOGAST
		Now there's a couple even remarking 
		about your sign, and see how easily 
		you forgot them?

				NORMAN
		What?

				ARBOGAST
		You thought no one has stopped here 
		in weeks. Now, try to remember if 
		this girl...

				ARBOGAST
			(A pause, a study)
		Maybe she even signed the register... 
		because habits die hard. Let's check 
		it, huh?

	Norman says nothing. Arbogast goes to the desk, pulls the 
	registry book around, flips back a page or two.

	Norman simply stares at the man. Arbogast hums faintly, 
	pleasantly, as he examines the pages. Then:

				ARBOGAST
		Yes sir! Marie Samuels.  Interesting 
		alias.

	He takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside 
	the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding 
	and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as 
	happy as it is making him.

				ARBOGAST
		Don't know where she got "Marie," 
		but "Samuels" figures. Her boy 
		friend's name is Sam.
			(Turns to Norman, the 
			smile gone)
		Was she in disguise? Or do you want 
		to check the picture again?

				NORMAN
		I didn't lie to you. I just have 
		trouble keeping track of... time.

	Arbogast has reached him, the picture extended. Norman looks 
	dutifully at it.

				NORMAN
		It was raining and her hair didn't 
		look like that... damped out, I guess.

				ARBOGAST
		Tell me all about her.

				NORMAN
		She arrived kind of late, wet and 
		hungry and she was very tired and 
		went right to bed and left early.

				ARBOGAST
		How early?

				NORMAN
		Very early. Dawn.

				ARBOGAST
		Of which morning?

				NORMAN
		The following morning. Sunday.

				ARBOGAST
		No one met her?

				NORMAN
		No.

				ARBOGAST
		Or arrived with her.

				NORMAN
		No.

				ARBOGAST
		She didn't call anyone? Even locally?

				NORMAN
		No.

				ARBOGAST
		You didn't spend the whole night 
		with her did you?

				NORMAN
		No! Of all...

				ARBOGAST
		How do you know she didn't make a 
		call?

				NORMAN
		She was tired. She said she had a 
		long drive ahead of her, in the 
		morning... Yes, now I'm remembering 
		very clearly because I'm picturing. 
		When you make a picture of the moment 
		in your mind, you can remember every 
		detail. She was sitting back there, 
		no she was standing up, with some 
		sandwich still in her hand, and she 
		said she had to drive a long way.

				ARBOGAST
		Back where?

				NORMAN
		What do you mean?

				ARBOGAST
		You said she was sitting "back there," 
		or standing rather...

				NORMAN
		Oh. My private parlor. She had an 
		awful hunger... so I made her some 
		supper. And then she went to bed and 
		left in the morning. I didn't even 
		see her leave.

				ARBOGAST
		How did she pay you?

				NORMAN
		What?

				ARBOGAST
		Cash or check? For the cabin...

				NORMAN
		Cash.

				ARBOGAST
		And when she left, she never came 
		back.

				NORMAN
		Why should she? I'm sorry, I have 
		work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...

				ARBOGAST
		I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't 
		aspic!
			(smiles)
		This ain't jelling.

				NORMAN
		I don't know what you expect me to 
		know about... people come and go...

				ARBOGAST
		She isn't still here, is she?

				NORMAN
		Not at all!

				ARBOGAST
		Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, 
		all twelve... would I need a warrant?

				NORMAN
			(as if pleasantly 
			exasperated)
		Look, if you won't believe me, go 
		ahead. You can help me make beds if 
		you like.
			(laughs, shakes his 
			head)
		Come on.

	He starts out. Arbogast pauses, momentarily confused by the 
	young man's openness.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)

	Norman walks down the porch, hesitates before Cabin One, 
	walks on a bit toward Cabin Two, stops, turns to see if 
	Arbogast is following. Arbogast has come out onto the porch, 
	but is not following. He has walked to the opposite end of 
	the porch and is standing at its edge, looking up at the old 
	house. The upstairs window is in darkness. The neon of the 
	Vacancy and Motel signs splash strange light over the scene.

				NORMAN
		Change your mind?

	Arbogast does not reply. Norman becomes apprehensive, starts 
	to Arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful.

				NORMAN
		I guess I've got one of those faces 
		you can't help believing.

				ARBOGAST
			(to Norman, but 
			continuing to stare 
			at the house)
		Anyone at home?

				NORMAN
		I live there. Alone.

				ARBOGAST
		Someone is sitting in that window.

				NORMAN
		My mother.

	Arbogast turns, gazes seriously at him.

				NORMAN
		She's... ill. Confined to her room. 
		It's practically living alone.

				ARBOGAST
			(after a pause)
		If this girl Mary Crane were here, 
		you'd have no reason to hide her 
		would you?

				NORMAN
		Of course not.

				ARBOGAST
		If she paid you well?

				NORMAN
		Now, look...!

				ARBOGAST
		Or if she had you say... gallantly 
		protecting her... you wouldn't be 
		fooled... you'd know she was just 
		using you. Wouldn't you?

				NORMAN
		I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable 
		of being fooled! Not even by women!

				ARBOGAST
		I didn't mean that as a slur on your 
		manhood. I'm sorry.

				NORMAN
			(disturbed now)
		That's all right. maybe she could 
		have fooled me.  But...
			(a rueful smile)
		She didn't fool my mother.

				ARBOGAST
		Your mother met her?
			(quickly)
		Can I talk to your mother?

				NORMAN
		No. I told you, she's confined...

				ARBOGAST
		Just for a moment. She might have 
		picked up a hint you'd miss.

				ARBOGAST
		Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I 
		won't disturb...

				NORMAN
		No! Just no!  I have one of those 
		breaking points like any other man, 
		believe it or not, and I'm near it.
		There's just so much pushing I can 
		take and I think...

				ARBOGAST
		All right!
			(starts away, toward 
			his car, pauses)
		Might save me a lot of leg-work if I 
		could just talk to your mother.  But 
		I'd need a warrant for that, won't 
		I?

	Norman does not respond. Arbogast gets in his car, starts 
	the motor. Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own 
	face showing apprehension. Arbogast backs the car around 
	very slowly, his gaze divided between the old house and the 
	lighted window of Cabin Two. As he turns the car out, his 
	headlights light up the porch.

	Norman stands, watching him drive away.

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT)

	The car pulls up and Arbogast gets out of car, leaving motor 
	running. As he starts to walk across the highway, CAMERA 
	PULLS AWAY and we

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY WITH TELEPHONE BOOTH - (NIGHT)

	Arbogast gets to the phone booth, enters. CAMERA STARTS 
	FORWARD, and we see Arbogast remove a small notebook from 
	his pocket, check on a number, drop a dime in the slot and 
	dial this number. As we reach phone booth,

							 CUT TO:

				ARBOGAST
			(into phone)
		Miss Crane, please.
			(listens)
		She leave a number?
			(listens)
		Thanks.
			(hangs up, dials again, 
			waits)
		Lila there, Mr. Loomis? Arbogast.
			(waits)
		Lila? Look, this isn't much, but it 
		might make you feel a little better. 
		Mary was up here. Spent last Saturday 
		night at Bates'  Motel, out here on 
		the old highway.
			(listens)
		Young fellow runs it, said Mary spent 
		the night, left, period!
			(listens)
		I did question him, believe me. I 
		think I got all there was to get.  
		Just have to try to pick up the scent 
		from here.
			(listens)
		Well... maybe that's because I don't 
		feel entirely satisfied.  He's got a 
		sick old mother, confined type, and 
		I think she saw Mary and talked to 
		her. Shame, too... confined old women 
		love to talk to strangers.
			(listens)
		I was, but I think I'll go back to 
		the motel, first.
			(listens)
		No, you stay put, Lila. With Loomis. 
		I should be back in an hour.
			(listens)
		All right. And Lila... You'll be 
		happy to know what I think. I think 
		our friend Sam Loomis didn't even 
		know Mary was here.
			(smiles)
		See you in an hour. Or less.

	He hangs up, gets out of the phone booth.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)

	A distant view of the House and Motel. There is a light on 
	in the house. There is also a light on in Norman's office. 
	We see Norman emerge from his office and move along the porch 
	toward the distant cabins. He carries sheets on his arm. He 
	goes into the last cabin and switches the light on. Into the 
	foreground the hood of the white Ford enters the scene and 
	stops. Arbogast gets out. He goes over to the Motel office.

	EXT. MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)

	Arbogast goes in.

	INT. OFFICE - (NIGHT)

	Arbogast looks around the empty office and calls.

				ARBOGAST
		Bates!

	He goes over to the door to the parlor and enters. He looks 
	around the bird-ridden room. He stops short as he sees:

	C.U. - THE OLD SAFE IN THE CORNER

	C.U. - ARBOGAST

	goes over to it. He finds it unlocked. With a quick, cautious 
	look around he opens it.

	C.U. - THE EMPTY SAFE

	C.U. - ARBOGAST

	straightens up and goes out.

	EXT. MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)

	Arbogast comes out and looks off. He sees:

	THE LAST LIT CABIN

	The door ajar.

	C.U. - ARBOGAST - (NIGHT)

	would go along but he stops with a new thought. He turns 
	around and looks off.

	L.S. - THE OLD HOUSE FROM HIS VIEWPOINT - (NIGHT)

	C.U. - ARBOGAST

	comes to a decision. He goes off.

	L.S. ARBOGAST

	dashes up the stone steps to the House.

	MEDIUM SHOT

	CAMERA HOLDS as Arbogast goes up onto the porch. The house 
	is dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill 
	of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs 
	hall. Arbogast goes to the living room window, looks in, 
	sees only darkness. Then he goes to the door, listens for 
	along moment, hears nothing.

	Very slowly, almost painfully, he turns the knob of the door 
	and pushes gently with his arm and shoulder. The door begins 
	to open. He allows it to open just enough for him to slip 
	through and into the foyer.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. FOYER OF BATES' HOUSE - (NIGHT)

	Arbogast gradually eases the door closed, stands against it, 
	waiting. He looks up in the direction of the light, sees no 
	one. The door at the head of the stairs is closed. Arbogast 
	listens, holds his breath, hears what could be human sounds 
	coming from upstairs but realizes these could also be the 
	sounds of an old house after sunset. After a careful wait, 
	he crosses to the stairs, starts up, slowly, guardedly, 
	placing a foot squarely on each step to test it for squeaks 
	or groans before placing his full weight on it. CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS, remaining on floor level but TRAVELLING ALONG the 
	stairway as Arbogast makes his way up.

							 CUT TO:

	EXTREMELY HIGH ANGLE

	INT. STAIRWAY AND UPSTAIRS LANDING

	We see Arbogast coming up the stairs. And now we see, too, 
	the door of the mother's room, opening, carefully and slowly.

	As Arbogast reaches the landing, the door opens and the mother 
	steps out, her hand raises high, the blade of an enormous 
	knife flashing.

	C.U. - A BIG HEAD OF AN ASTONISHED ARBOGAST

	The knife slashes across his cheek and neck. Blood spurts. 
	The sudden attack throws him off balance. He stumbles back 
	and staggers down the whole of the staircase. He frantically 
	gropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the 
	stairs. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him all the way. A wicked knife 
	keeps thrusting itself into the foreground. As he collapses 
	at the bottom, the black head and shoulders of Mrs. Bates 
	plunges into the foreground as the CAMERA MOVES IN to contain 
	the raising and descending murder weapon.

							FADE OUT

							 FADE IN

	INT. BACK ROOM OF HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)

	Lila is sitting close by the phone, and looks as if she hasn't 
	moved from it in the last hour. Sam is pacing, occasionally 
	stopping at the window, glancing out, pacing again. The ash 
	tray close to Lila is filled.

	There is a thick atmosphere of smoke, tension and weariness 
	in the small, otherwise cozy room.

				SAM
			(at window, quietly)
		Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely 
		sound. Ever notice, Lila?

				LILA
			(unable to keep up 
			small talk)
		Sam. He said an hour. Or less.

				SAM
		It's been three.

				LILA
		Are we just going to go on sitting 
		here?

				SAM
			(suddenly cheerful)
		He'll be back. Let's sit still and 
		hang on, okay?

				LILA
		You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.

				SAM
		Hundreds! Which one is your pet?

				LILA
		Whenever I start contemplating the 
		panic button, your back straightens
		up and your eyes get that God-looks-
		out-for-everybody look and... I feel 
		better.

				SAM
		I feel better when you feel better.

				LILA
			(a pause - then she 
			rises)
		Where's the old highway?

				SAM
		You want to run out there, bust in 
		on Arbogast and the sick old lady, 
		shake her up and maybe spoil 
		everything Arbogast's been building 
		for the last three hours.

				LILA
		Yes.

				SAM
		That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.

				LILA
		Patience doesn't run in our family.
		Sam, I'm going out there!

				SAM
		Arbogast said...

				LILA
		An hour! Or less!

	Sam stares at her, frowns in concern over her very real 
	anxiety, goes to the phone, dials operator.

				SAM
			(into phone)
		Got the number of the motel out on 
		the old highway? Bates, I think.
			(waits)

				LILA
		Sam! Why call when we can go?

				SAM
		And maybe pass Arbogast on the road?
			(into phone)
		Thanks.

	He presses down the receiver, releases it, dials Bates'

	Motel. The faint other-end ringing tones can be heard, 
	repeatedly, annoyingly. He waits.

				SAM
			(to Lila)
		Probably on his way back right now.

				LILA
		Sam, I'm going.

				SAM
			(hangs up and picks 
			up his jacket)
		You'll never find it.

	He starts for the door. Lila follows after him into the store.

	INT. STORE

	He pauses halfway down, turns, puts his hands on her arms.

				SAM
		Stay here.

				LILA
		Why can't I go out there with you?

				SAM
			(looks at her)
		I don't know...
			(he collects himself)
		One of us has to be here in case 
		Arbogast's on the way.

				LILA
			(nervously)
		Just wait here?

				SAM
			(a warm smile)
		Contemplate your... panic button.

	He hurries down to the street door and out. CAMERA HOLDS on 
	Lila as she stares after Sam. As she stands alone in the 
	darkened store, all the hardware seems to take on sinister 
	shapes.

	C.U.

	Among some bathroom fittings a nozzle from a shower falls 
	onto the floor.

	MEDIUM SHOT

	Lila turns and picks if from the floor and puts it back in 
	its place. She turns and again looks to the deserted street 
	with a touch of anxiety. She gives a slight unconscious 
	shiver.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)

	Tall and lonely still against the moonlight, the figure of 
	Norman, silhouetted. He doesn't move, merely stands there at 
	the edge of the swamp, staring down at the now calm and quiet 
	face of it.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. THE MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)

	All light are out, except the light in Norman's mother's 
	room. And her figure can be seen sitting in the window, 
	relaxed in a high-back chair, her face turned into the room.  
	After a second, we hear the SOUND OF A MOTOR, and then Sam's 
	small pick-up truck swings into the driveway.

	Sam stops the motor, automatically switches off headlights, 
	pauses as he observes the silence and darkness of the area. 
	Then he hops out of the cab, goes quickly to the office, 
	knocks on the door. As he waits for a response, he looks 
	down the long porch, studies the darkened cabins, knocks 
	again, louder, looks in the other direction and sees the 
	house and the figure at the one lit window. He stares a moment 
	then calls loudly:

				SAM
		Arbogast?

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. THE SWAMP

	The silhouette of Norman. He is still. Over shot, very dimly, 
	comes the SOUND OF SAM'S VOICE, calling again for Arbogast.

	Norman turns slowly until, in silhouette, we see his profile, 
	his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in 
	the direction of the house. There is silence for a moment, 
	and then again the SOUND of Sam POUNDING at the door.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)

	The store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room 
	spilling in.

	L.S.

	With CAMERA placed with its back to the street door, we can 
	see the distant tiny figure of Lila seated and waiting in 
	the back room beyond. There is a SOUND of a car pulling up. 
	The tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back 
	room down the aisle of hardware and comes into a BIG HEAD. 
	We see Lila's desperate anxious look.

	MEDIUM SHOT

	From her viewpoint we see Sam alighting from his truck and 
	coming toward the door of the store. He enters. He and Lila 
	exchange quiet glances.

				SAM
		He didn't come back here?

				LILA
			(worriedly)
		Sam.

				SAM
		No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the 
		old lady at home...
			(frowning)
		A sick old lady unable to answer the 
		door... or unwilling.

				LILA
		Where could he have gone?

				SAM
		Maybe he got some definite lead.
		Maybe he went right on...

				LILA
		Without calling me?

				SAM
		In a hurry.

				LILA
		Sam, he called me when he had nothing 
		definite, nothing but a dissatisfied 
		feeling. Don't you think he'd have 
		called if he had anything...

				SAM
			(interrupting)
		Yes. I think he would have.

	Lila goes quiet. Sam starts toward the back room, pauses at 
	the doorway, turns. Lila has remained by the door, looking 
	out at the street. She feels his pause, turns, and for a 
	moment they share at each other across the darkened room.

				SAM
		Let's go see Al Chambers.

				LILA
		Who's he?

				SAM
		He's the Deputy Sheriff around here.

	As he starts forward.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. STREET THE SHERIFF LIVES ON - (NIGHT)

	A dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses 
	dim in the moonlight. Sam's pick-up truck comes down the 
	street, pulls up before the house of Sheriff Chambers. CAMERA 
	MOVES IN on Sam and Lila as they remain for a moment in the 
	truck's cab, staring quietly at the sleeping house.

				SAM
		Our Deputy sleeps.

				LILA
		Well?

				SAM
		Nothing.  Just... all the lights 
		out... must be asleep.

				LILA
			(a small exasperation)
		Does that mean we can't...

				SAM
		No. I'm just procrastinating.  People 
		hate when the doorbell rings in the 
		middle of the night.
			(gives up, starts out)
		Come on.

	He gets out of cab, goes around to help Lila. She is already 
	out. CAMERA FOLLOWS them up the small path to the front door. 
	Sam presses the bell button. Both he and Lila are almost 
	knocked over by the shocking, clanging, ear-splitting BLAST 
	OF THE BELL within the house, a ring which sounds more like 
	a fire alarm than a doorbell.

	He tries to smile, fails. Lila doesn't even try. The 
	downstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is 
	unhesitatingly opened by MRS. CHAMBERS, a small, lively stick 
	of a woman wrapped in a thick flannel robe and a corona of 
	hospitality.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Oh?

				SAM
		Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering 
		you...

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		You didn't!
			(a cross look up at 
			the bell)
		It's tinkerbell.
			(a quick smile at 
			Lila)
		Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if 
		anyone rings it in the middle of the 
		night.
			(to Sam)
		Well come on in, at least!

	As she opens the door wide,

							 CUT TO:

	Fat roses splatter the wallpaper. The stairs are carpeted. 
	The lighting is bright.

	There is a perfectly fitting wall phone by the parlor arch. 
	Mrs. Chambers goes to the stairway, yells up.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Albert!
			(a tiny wait, a smile 
			as Sam and Lila enter)
		Al Chambers!

	Sam is about to close the door behind him. Mrs. Chambers 
	motions for him not to, scurries across the hall, leans 
	outside, presses the doorbell. The RING within the house is 
	even more shattering. She closes the door, starts to the 
	stairway, pauses as the SOUNDS of movement above COME OVER 
	SHOT.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Customers!

	SHERIFF CHAMBERS comes down the stairs, in a bathrobe which 
	matches his wife's. He is a tall, narrow man with a face 
	originally destined for Mount Rushmore. He nods at Sam, looks 
	at him with wide-awake eyes and a no-nonsense concern.  

				SAM
		We have a problem.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
			(to Lila)
		Let's go out back and have some coca 
		while the men are talking.

				LILA
		No, thank you. It's my problem, too.

				SAM
		I don't know where to start...
			(a look at Lila)
		Except at the beginning.

				LILA
		Yes.

				SAM
			(to Sheriff)
		This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix.
		She's been here for a few days, 
		looking for her sister. There's a 
		private detective helping... and, 
		well, we got a call tonight, from 
		this detective, saying he'd traced 
		Mary...

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Mary is Lila's sister?

				SAM
		Yes. He traced her to that motel, 
		out on the old highway...

				MRS. CHAMBERS
			(to the Sheriff)
		Bates' Motel.
			(to Lila)
		He has a mind like a mechanical brain 
		and the more information you feed 
		it... Go on, Sam.

				SAM
		He traced her there and called us to 
		say he was going to question Mrs. 
		Bates...

				MRS. CHAMBERS
			(a pleasant shock)
		Norman took a wife?

				SAM
		No. An old woman, his mother.
			(to Sheriff, quickly)
		That was early this evening. And we 
		haven't seen or heard from him since.  
		I went out to the motel, just got 
		back. No one was in the office, and...

				LILA
			(interrupting, 
			anxiously)
		Will you help us? I think something's 
		wrong out there!

				SHERIFF
			(after a considerate 
			pause)
		Now. Your sister is missing how long?

				LILA
		She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. 
		And no trace until...

				SHERIFF
		How'd you and this detective come to 
		trace her to Fairvale?

				SAM
		They thought she'd be coming to me.

				SHERIFF
		Left Phoenix under her own steam?

				LILA
		Yes.

				SHERIFF
			(a pause)
		She ain't missing so much as she's 
		run away.

				SAM
		Yes.

				SHERIFF
		From what?

				LILA
			(a look at sam, then:)
		She stole some money.

				SHERIFF
		A lot?

				LILA
		Forty thousand dollars.

				SHERIFF
		And the police haven't been able 
		to...

				SAM
			(interrupting)
		Everyone concerned thought... if 
		they could get her to give back the 
		money... they could avoid involving 
		her with the police.

				SHERIFF
		Explains the private detective. He 
		traced her to the Bates place.  What'd 
		he exactly say when he called you?

				LILA
		Mary had been there, one night, and 
		had left.

				SHERIFF
		With the forty thousand dollars?

				LILA
		He didn't mention the money.
			(anxiously)
		What he said on the phone isn't 
		important, is it?  He was supposed 
		to come back after he spoke to the 
		mother, and he didn't! That's what I 
		want you to do something about!

				SHERIFF
		Like what?

				LILA
		Go out there! Find somebody, ask 
		some questions!
			(a pause)
		I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to 
		you. I keep thinking... something's 
		wrong. I have to know what!

				SHERIFF
		I think something's wrong, too, Miss. 
		But not the same thing. I think your 
		private detective is what's wrong.
			(As Lila is about to 
			object)
		I think he got himself a hot lead as 
		to where your sister was going... 
		probably from Norman Bates...  and 
		called you to keep you still while 
		he took off after her and the money.

				LILA
		He said he was dissatisfied... and 
		was going back.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
			(to Sheriff)
		Why don't you call Norman and let 
		him say just what happened, if he 
		give the man a hot lead and he did 
		just scooted off... it'll make the 
		girl feel better, Albert.

				SHERIFF
		At this hour?

				SAM
		He was out when I was there. If he's 
		back he probably isn't even in bed 
		yet.

				SHERIFF
		He wasn't out when you were there.  
		He just wasn't answering the door in 
		the dead of night... like some people 
		do. This fellow lives like a hermit...

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Recluse. Kinder word.

				SHERIFF
			(to Sam)
		You must remember that bad business 
		out there. About ten years ago...

				SAM
		I've only been here five. Right now 
		it feels like ten, but...

				LILA
		All right! Then call! At least, call!

	Mrs. Chambers goes to phone, dials operator.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
			(into phone)
		Florrie, the Sheriff wants you to 
		connect him with the Bates Motel.

	She hands the receiver to the Sheriff. He takes it, 
	reluctantly, listens to the dim sound of RINGING on the other 
	end. After a moment:

				SHERIFF
			(into phone)
		Norman? Sheriff Chambers.
			(listens)
		Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we 
		got some worries here. Did you have 
		a man stop out there tonight...
			(listens)
		Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, 
		anyway. A private detective, name 
		of...

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Arbogast.

				SHERIFF
			(into phone)
		Arbogast.
			(listens)
		And after he left?
			(listens)
		No, it's okay, Norman. How's it been 
		going out there?
			(listens)
		Well, I think you oughta unload that 
		place and open up closer in to the 
		action, a smaller place, you know... 
		but...

				LILA
		Please!

				SHERIFF
			(into phone)
		Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to 
		sleep. Yeah, be glad to.
			(hangs up, turns to 
			Mrs. Chambers)
		Said to give you his regards.

				SAM
			(faint irony)
		Was that all?

				SHERIFF
		This detective was out there and 
		Norman told him about the girl and 
		the detective thanked him and went 
		away.

				LILA
		And he didn't go back? Didn't see 
		the mother?

	The Sheriff looks long at Lila, shakes his head 
	sympathetically.

				SHERIFF
		You should've called in the police 
		the second you found your sister has 
		skipped. You go starting private 
		investigations, using people you 
		don't even know...

				LILA
		What difference does that...

				SHERIFF
		Your Detective told you a nakedfaced 
		lie.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Barefaced.

				SHERIFF
		He told you he wasn't coming right 
		back cause he wanted to question 
		Norman Bates' mother, right?

				LILA
		Yes.

				SHERIFF
			(a pause, then calmly)
		Norman Bates' mother has been dead 
		and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for 
		the last ten years!

	There is a long silence. Sam and Lila stare at the Sheriff.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		I helped Norman pick out the dress 
		she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

				SHERIFF
		It ain't only local history, Sam, 
		it's the only murder-and-suicide 
		case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs.
		Bates poisoned this guy she was... 
		involved with, when she found out he 
		was married, then took a helping of 
		the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. 
		Ugly way to die.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Norman found them dead together.  In 
		bed.

				SAM
		You mean that old woman I saw sittin' 
		in the window wasn't Norman Bates' 
		mother?

				MRS. CHAMBERS
			(hopefully, happily)
		Maybe you saw Mary!

				SAM
		I'd know the difference between Mary 
		and an old woman.

				SHERIFF
		Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you 
		saw an old woman?

				SAM
		Yes! In the house behind the motel. 
		I pounded and called but she... just 
		ignored me.

				SHERIFF
		And you want to tell me you saw Norman 
		Bates' mother.

				LILA
		It must've been. Arbogast said so, 
		too... and he said the young man 
		wouldn't let him see her because she 
		was ill!

	The Sheriff stares at both of them, and when he finally speaks 
	there is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice.

				SHERIFF
		Well, if the woman up there is Mrs.
		Bates... who's that woman buried out 
		at Greenlawn Cemetery?

						QUICK CUT TO:

	INT. NORMAN'S PARLOR BEHIND OFFICE - (NIGHT)

	Norman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone next to 
	him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to 
	move his hand after hanging up. He is staring at the shrike-
	like bird which is perched on the lamp shade. Decision and 
	resolution are beginning to show in his face. Suddenly he 
	rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off 
	the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking 
	the bird off the shade.

	He watches it fall, does not try to catch it. It hits the 
	floor with a thud and sawdust spills out. He stares sadly at 
	it, for a moment, then tends down, scoops up the sawdust, 
	tries to press it into the split seam, picks up the bird, 
	puts it in a drawer. Then he puts out the lamp, goes out, 
	crosses the darkened office and goes outside.

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)

	Norman comes off the porch, walks to the path and directly 
	up to the house, opens the door and goes in.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRWAY - (NIGHT)

	SHOOTING UP THE STAIRS

	Norman goes up, pauses one moment outside his mother's door, 
	then opens it and goes in, leaving the door open.

	For a moment we hear only Norman's low, quiet voice, his 
	words indistinguishable. Then we hear the cold shot of his 
	mother's derisive laughter.

				MOTHER'S VOICE
		I am sorry, boy, but you do manage 
		to look ludicrous when you give me 
		orders!

				NORMAN'S VOICE
		Please, mother...

				MOTHER'S VOICE
			(Sharp, laughter all 
			gone)
		No! I will not hide in the fruit 
		cellar!
			(A shrill laugh)
		Think I'm fruity, huh?
			(Hard, cold again)
		I'm staying right here!  This is my 
		room and no one will drag me out of 
		it... least of all my big bold son!

				NORMAN'S VOICE
			(Rising now, anxiously)
		They'll come now, Mother. He came 
		after the girl and now someone will 
		come after him! How long do you think 
		you can go on... Mother, please, 
		just for a few days, just so they 
		won't find you!

				MOTHER'S VOICE
			(Mimicking)
		Just for a few days...
			(Furious)
		In that dank fruit cellar? No!  You 
		hid me there once, boy, and you won't 
		do it again! Not ever again!  Now 
		get out!
			(A pause, quiet)
		I told you to get out, boy!
			(A longer pause)
		Norman! What do you think you're 
		going to do? Don't you touch me!
		Don't! Norman!
			(A pause, then 
			cajolingly)
		All right, son, put me down and I'll 
		go. I'll go on my own two feet. I 
		can go on my own two feet, can't I?

	During all this the CAMERA has been slowly creeping up the 
	stairs. It does not stop at the top however, but continues 
	on the same high angle that we had in Scene 57.

	She starts to laugh, a terrible sound like an obscene melody.

				NORMAN'S VOICE
		I'll carry you, mother.

	Norman comes out of the room, his mother held in his arms, 
	her head leaning against his shoulder. He carries her down 
	the stairs, along the lower landing to the cellar stairs, 
	and then down those stairs to the basement.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. FAIRVALE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - (MORNING)

	An overcast morning, but a sunny-faced crowd. The service is 
	just over, there is contentment, and peace, and just a little 
	I-went-to-church-smugness in the faces of the churchgoers as 
	they come out of the chapel, and spread their separate ways 
	away.

	Amongst the crowd, waiting and searching the faces, are Sam 
	and Lila. In their expressions there is no peace, no 
	contentment. CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE. They are not speaking. 
	Lila looks as if she has had no sleep.

	Suddenly, Sam becomes alert, takes Lila's arm, starts toward 
	the church.

	CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM, stops as they approach Sheriff and 
	Mrs. Chambers. The Sheriff stares rather sympathetically at 
	Lila. Mrs. Chambers smiles nicely.

				SAM
		We thought, if you didn't mind, we'd 
		go out to the motel with you.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		He's already been.

				SHERIFF
		Went out before service.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		Have you two had breakfast?

				SAM
			(To Sheriff, not a 
			question)
		You didn't find anything.

				SHERIFF
		Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.

	He moves away and the others follow. CAMERA PANS them to the 
	curb.

				LILA
			(Interrupting)
		Did he say anything about my sister?

				SHERIFF
		Just what he told your detective.

	She used a fake name, saw the register myself. Saw the whole 
	place, as a matter of fact. That boy is alone there.

				SAM
		No mother.

				SHERIFF
		You must've seen an illusion, Sam.
		Now, I know you're not the seeing-
		illusion type... But no woman was 
		illusion there and I don't believe 
		in ghosts, so there it is!

				LILA
		I still feel...

				SHERIFF
		Can see you do. Sorry I couldn't 
		make you feel better. You want to 
		come to my office this afternoon and 
		report a missing person... And the 
		theft, is what you want to do!  Sooner 
		you drop this thing in the lap of 
		the law, that's the sooner you'll 
		stand a chance of your sister bein' 
		picked up. How about that?

				LILA
		I don't know.

				MRS. CHAMBERS
		It's Sunday. Come over and do the 
		reporting at the house, 'round dinner 
		time. Make it nicer. You too, Sam.

	She smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss 
	this year's charity fandango, takes the

	Sheriff's arm, starts away. The Sheriff nods as he goes.

	Sam and Lila are alone now, at the curb, before the deserted 
	chapel. For a long moment they just stand there, their faces 
	as gray and overcast as the sky.

				SAM
		Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.

				LILA
		You're not.

	Sam takes her arm, starts walking her up the street toward 
	the spot where his pick-up truck is parked.

	CAMERA FOLLOWS them.

				SAM
		Want me to drop you at the hotel?  
		Or you want to come over to the store?

	Lila does not answer. They reach the truck. Lila looks 
	directly at Sam as he helps her into the cab.

				LILA
		I won't feel satisfied unless I got 
		out there, Sam.

				SAM
		Neither will I.

	He slams the door, hurries around truck, gets into driver's 
	seat, starts motor. As the truck drives off,

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	SAM AND LILA IN TRUCK - (PROCESS - HIGHWAY)

	For a moment, both are silent; Sam watching the road as if 
	there were other cars on it, Lila staring at nothing in 
	particular, except perhaps her own inner fear.

				LILA
		I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.

				SAM
		Of course we will.

				LILA
		Alive.

	Sam looks as if he'd like to say something humorous, something 
	to cheer her. He cannot. He remains silent.

				LILA
		We lived together all our lives.

	When we woke up one morning and found ourselves orphans, 
	Mary quit college and got a job, so I could go to college.

				SAM
		Where'd you go to college?

				LILA
		I didn't. I got a job, too.
			(A pause)
		I wonder if that hurt her, my not 
		letting her sacrifice for me?  Some 
		people are so willing to suffer for 
		you that they suffer more if you 
		don't let them.

				SAM
			(Almost to himself)
		She was willing to lick the stamps.

	Lila looks quizzically at him, is too concerned to pursue 
	it.

				LILA
		I wonder so many things about her 
		now.  Why she never told me about 
		you...  Funny, when you think there's 
		an answer to everything, you think 
		you know all the answers.

				SAM
		We were going to get married. Are 
		going to get married!

				LILA
		Do you know how I found out about 
		you? I found one of your letters... 
		it was a nice letter, Sam.

				SAM
		This is the old highway.

				LILA
		I suppose... when you were able to 
		marry her she'd have presented you, 
		all shiny and proper... she always 
		tried to be proper.

				SAM
		Watch your tenses.

				LILA
		Huh?

				SAM
		She always tries to be proper.

	Sam slows the truck to a stop, sighs, starts to light up a 
	cigarette. Lila looks questioningly and impatiently at him.

				LILA
		You going to wait here for me?

				SAM
		I'm going with you. But we'd better 
		decide what we're going to say and 
		do when we walk in...

				LILA
		We're going to register. As man and 
		wife. And get shown to a cabin... 
		and then search every inch of that 
		place, inside and... outside.

				SAM
		You won't believe it...
			(Starts motor)
		But this will be the first time
		I've ever pulled one of those man-
		and-wife-renting-cabin capers!

				LILA
			(A tiny smile, first 
			in hours)
		I believe it.

	As truck starts to drive on,

							 CUT TO:

	EXT. THE BATES MOTEL AND HOUSE - (DAY)

	The place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep 
	gray of the cloudy sky. We see Sam's truck turning into the 
	driveway and pulling to a stop. After a moment, Sam and Lila 
	get out of the truck.

	FRESH ANGLE

	Close on Sam and Lila as they meet on the porch side of the 
	truck. The motel office and the house beyond can be seen in 
	b.g. of shot. Sam and Lila merely stare for a moment, then 
	turn and gaze up at the house. There is no figure in the 
	window and the shade is drawn. Same goes to the office door, 
	peers in, knocks, opens door, enters. Lila remains on the 
	driveway, beside the truck.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM - (DAY)

	CLOSE ANGLE on Norman standing by the window. He has pulled 
	the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at 
	the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is 
	standing by the truck and looking up at the house.  Norman 
	studies her, and as her eyes look up at this very window he 
	closes the curtains, turns away.

	We see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic 
	and his struggle to contain it. Then he goes away. CAMERA 
	remains on window, shooting out and down, and through the 
	frail curtains we can see Sam as he comes out of the motel 
	office and joins Lila.

	EXT. MOTEL OFFICE - CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA

				SAM
			(Unconsciously 
			whispering)
		I wonder where Norman Bates does his 
		hermiting?

				LILA
		Someone was at that window. I saw 
		the curtain move.

	Sam takes Lila's arm.

				SAM
		Come on.

	He starts with her toward the path which leads to the old 
	house. CAMERA PANS with them, and as they turn around the 
	office corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward 
	them. They pause and Norman pauses. He does not smile, nor 
	speak. His usual grin and soft friendliness are gone; 
	containment and impassivity lie in their place.

				SAM
			(Cheerfully)
		Just coming up to ring for you.

				NORMAN
			(Coming forward)
		I suppose you want a cabin.

				SAM
		We'd hoped to make it straight to 
		San Francisco, but we don't like the 
		look of that sky. Looks like a bad 
		day coming... doesn't it.

	Norman walks past Sam, giving him the sort of quick, 
	disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying, 
	goes onto the porch and into the office. Sam and Lila follow 
	Norman.

	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)

	Norman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to 
	cabin number twelve off the keyboard. Sam and Lila have 
	entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time.

				NORMAN
		I'll take you to...

				SAM
		Better sign in first, hasn't we?

	Sam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book.

				NORMAN
		It isn't necessary.

				SAM
			(Interrupting with a 
			friendly cheerfulness)
		Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this 
		trip... ninety percent business... 
		and he wants practically notarized 
		receipts. I better sign in and get a 
		receipt.

	Norman stares at Sam, as if he'd like to yell at him, call 
	him "liar." Instead he reaches under the desk counter, brings 
	out the registration book. Lila moves closer, studies the 
	book as Sam signs in. Sam signs "Joe and Mrs. Johnson."  The 
	signature and city of "Marie Samuels" and after it, the 
	notation "Cabin One," can be clearly seen three registrations 
	above Sam's.

	When Sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to Norman. 
	Norman does not take it, starts out from behind counter.

				NORMAN
		I'll get your bags.

				SAM
		Haven't any.

				NORMAN
			(after a stare)
		I'll show you the cabin.

	As he starts for the door, Sam laughs. Norman stops, turns, 
	looks at him.

				SAM
		First time I've seen it happen.
			(to Lila)
		Check in any place in this country 
		without bags, and you have to pay in 
		advance.

	Sam smiles as if at a funny remark, takes a bill out of his 
	pocket.

				NORMAN
		Ten dollars...

	Norman returns to Sam, takes the extended bill, is about to 
	start out again.

				SAM
		That receipt...?

	Norman goes reluctantly behind counter, lays down the key to 
	cabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under 
	counter, starts to write. Lila steps up to the desk, picks 
	up the key, quickly, starts out.

				LILA
		I'll start ahead.

	Norman looks up, gazes her as she goes out door.

	EXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)

	Lila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, tries 
	the door. It opens. She closes it quickly as she hears Sam 
	and Norman coming out of the motel office, continues on down 
	the porch.

				SAM
			(To Norman, who is 
			following)
		Don't bother yourself... we'll find 
		it.

	He goes on down the porch, doesn't even glance at cabin one, 
	walks quickly and catches up to Lila just as she reaches 
	cabin twelve. CAMERA REMAINS with Norman, who is standing by 
	the office door, looking after Sam and Lila, his face alert 
	and no longer impassive. He waits a moment, after they have 
	closed their cabin door, then crosses to the pickup truck.  
	CAMERA MOVES with him. He studies the truck, then leans in 
	through the driver's window, twists the registration card 
	around, reads it.

	It gives the correct name and address of Sam Loomis.

	Norman comes back out of the window, glances once more toward 
	cabin twelve, then at the old house. His suspicions are 
	confirmed, and now there is the relaxation of relief in his 
	face. He takes on a purposeful air, turns, strides up the 
	path, up onto the porch of the house, opens the door, goes 
	in.

	INT. CABIN TWELVE - (DAY)

	Lila is at the cabin's rear window, looking out, straining 
	for a glimpse of the old house, which cannot be seen from 
	the window of this cabin.

	She turns, frustrated, anxious. Sam is standing at the foot 
	of the bed, staring at the smooth coverlet, his brow creased 
	in a sadness.

				LILA
		We should have asked for Cabin One... 
		The one Mary was in.

				SAM
		I'm glad we didn't.

	He pulls his eyes from the bed, crosses to the desk, sits 
	wearily, lights a cigarette. Lila watches him for a moment, 
	feels a real compassion, goes to the bed, sits on its edge, 
	turns again and looks at Sam's back.

				LILA
		We have to go into that cabin and 
		search it, Sam... no matter what 
		we're afraid of finding and no matter 
		how much it may hurt.

				SAM
		I know.
			(A pause)
		Do you think if something happened, 
		it happened there?

				LILA
			(A pause, then:)
		Sam, if you owned a useless business 
		like this motel... one you probably 
		couldn't even sell...  what would 
		you need to get away, to start a new 
		business, somewhere else?
			(As Sam studies her)
		Forty thousand dollars?

				SAM
		How could we prove...
			(An almost hopeless 
			laugh)
		Well, if he opens a new motel on the 
		new highway... say, a year from now...

				LILA
		There must be some proof that exists 
		right now! Something that proves he 
		got that money away from Mary... 
		Some way!

				SAM
		What makes you sound so certain?

				LILA
		Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or 
		felt sorry for me... and he was 
		starting to feel the same about you. 
		I heard it when he called... in his 
		voice, a caring. He wouldn't have 
		gone anywhere or done anything without 
		telling us.  Unless he was stopped. 
		And he was stopped, so he must have 
		found out something!

	Sam considers a moment, nods agreement, rises.

				SAM
		We'll start with Cabin One.

	He goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then, 
	back to Lila:

				SAM
		If he sees us... we're just taking 
		the air.

	Lila goes to the door. He holds it open and she goes out.

	EXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)

	Sam closes the door, joins Lila, takes her hand.

	Together they walk along the porch in the direction of Cabin 
	One. CAMERA FOLLOWS. They pause before the door of Cabin 
	One. Sam motions Lila to wait, to hold still, then goes on 
	to the office, opens the door, calls in:

				SAM
		Bates?

	He waits, there is no response. He goes in and in a moment 
	comes back out, closes the door, goes to Lila.

	She has already opened the door of Cabin One and has started 
	to enter.

	INT. CABIN ONE - (DAY)

	The blinds are closed and the room is almost night-dark.

	Sam comes in after Lila, closes the door behind him.

	For a moment they just gaze at the room, as if willing it to 
	tell them some satisfactory story.

	Neither speaks. Then, in dark silence, they begin to search, 
	going methodically and thoroughly through all drawers, the 
	closet, the desk, searching under the bed and in dark corners, 
	not knowing what they expect to find and yet expecting to 
	find some thing. Lila opens the bathroom door, looks in. The 
	windowless room is very dark. She switches on the light, 
	goes in. Sam moves toward the bathroom, is about to follow 
	her in when he notices which room it is and automatically 
	catches himself up, backs out.

				SAM
		Sorry.

				LILA
		Hospital clean.

				SAM
		What?

				LILA
		The bathroom. Look at how clean it 
		is. The one in our cabin is clean... 
		but this is clean!

	Sam goes in, glances around, nods. Lila goes through the 
	medicine cabinet, finds nothing but a glass and two tiny 
	tabs of soap. Sam leans against the door-jamb, looks at the 
	tub, the shower pipe above it. He continues to stare, more 
	interested suddenly, as if bothered by some off-key evidence 
	he can't put his finger on. Then he looks at the shower 
	curtain rod.

	And realizes there is no shower curtain. He frowns, is about 
	to say something when Lila, who has been momentarily out of 
	shot, interrupts.

	Sam turns, CAMERA TURNS, and we see Lila is standing above 
	the toilet bowl, a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip 
	of her right index finger.

				SAM
		What is it?

				LILA
		It didn't get washed down. It's 
		figuring... the kind you tear up and 
		get rid of.
			(Extending her finger 
			toward Sam)
		Some figure has been added to or 
		subtracted from... forty thousand.

	Sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it, 
	takes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's 
	license shield, puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet 
	away.

				LILA
		That's proof Mary was here!  It would 
		be too wild a coincidence for somebody 
		else to...

				SAM
			(Reminding)
		Bates never denied Mary was here.

				LILA
			(Reminded)
		Yes.
			(A thought)
		But maybe this proves that Bates 
		found out about the money.

				SAM
		Do we simply ask him where he's hidden 
		it?

				LILA
		Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. 
		I think she told Arbogast something! 
		And I want her to tell us the same 
		thing!

	She starts out of the bathroom. Sam takes hold of her arm, 
	stops her.

				SAM
		You can't go up there.

				LILA
		Why not?

				SAM
		Bates.

	CAMERA STARTS TO PAN AWAY from them, moves slowly over the 
	room, very slowly.

				LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
		Let's find him. One of us can keep 
		him occupied while the other gets to 
		the woman.

				SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
		You won't be able to hold him still 
		if he doesn't want to be held. And I 
		don't like you going into that house 
		alone, Lila.

	CAMERA HAS PANNED clear across to the opposite wall now, and 
	is moving up closer and closer to the tiny-flowered wall 
	paper, finally closing in on one small rosebud.

				LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
		I can handle a sick old woman.

	Now we see that the rosebud has been cut out, that this is 
	the reverse side of the hole Norman peeped through to watch 
	Mary. And we see the pupil of Norman's eye now.

				SAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
		All right. I'll find Bates and keep 
		him occupied.

	The eye moves away and there is a brief flash of light before 
	the hole is covered, on the other side, by the wall-hung 
	painting.

	FRESH ANGLE - LILA AND SAM

	They are about to start out. Sam stops her again.

				SAM
		Wait a minute. If you get anything 
		out of the mother...
			(A thought)
		Can you find your way back to town?
			(As Lila nods yes)
		If you do get anything, don't stop 
		to tell me.

	Lila nods quickly, hurries to the door. Sam gets to it first, 
	opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough 
	for Lila and Himself to pass through.

	EXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)

	ANGLE CLOSE on cabin one as Lila comes out, turns to her 
	left, goes along porch toward cabin twelve. Sam remains at 
	the door, then turns right, heading for the path. As he passes 
	the office, he is shocked to see Norman standing just inside 
	the open door.

				NORMAN
		Looking for me?

				SAM
			(Recovering)
		Yes, matter of fact.
			(The friendly grin)
		The wife's taking a nap and... I can 
		never keep quiet enough for her... 
		so I thought I'd look you up and... 
		talk.

				NORMAN
		Satisfied with your cabin?

				SAM
		Fine.

	Sam starts into the office. Just before going in, he glances 
	down the long porch, sees Lila standing outside the door of 
	cabin twelve, waves her a tiny "all clear" signal.

	LILA

	CAMERA ANGLES to include Lila and her point of view.

	She watches Sam disappear into the office, waits until she 
	hears the door close, then looks about for another way to 
	reach the house. She sees the small alley at the end of this 
	L of cabins, starts toward it.

	EXT. REAR OF MOTEL - S.C.U. LILA - (DAY)

	Behind the motel Lila hesitates. She looks ahead.

	LONG SHOT - (DAY)

	The old house standing against the sky.

	CLOSE UP - (DAY)

	Lila moves forward.

	LONG SHOT - (DAY)

	The CAMERA approaching the house.

	CLOSE UP - (DAY)

	Lila glances toward the back of Norman's parlor. She moves 
	on.

	LONG SHOT - (DAY)

	The house coming nearer.

	CLOSE UP - (DAY)

	Lila looks up at the house. She moves forward purposefully.

	S.L.S. - (DAY)

	The house and the porch.

	CLOSE UP - (DAY)

	Lila stops at the house and looks up. She glances back.

	She turns to the house again.

	S.L.S. - (DAY)

	The CAMERA MOUNTS the steps to the porch.

	C.U. - (DAY)

	Lila puts out her hand.

	S.C.U. - (DAY)

	Lila's hand pushes the door open. We see the hallway.

	Lila ENTERS PAST CAMERA.

	INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila closes the door, remains by it for a moment, quiet, 
	listening. Her eyes scan the layout, the closed door which 
	leads off the hallway, to the dining room on the right and 
	the parlor on the left. Down at the end of the hall is the 
	kitchen, the door wide open, the room beyond dim and silent. 
	She notices the stairs leading down to the basement, stares 
	at them, then back to the stairs leading to the second floor. 
	She starts forward, and seems about to investigate the parlor 
	and dining room.

	INT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)

	Norman is behind the counter, standing, staring at Sam who 
	is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa. Norman has the look of 
	one who is protecting himself, as if the counter were a 
	protective wall against the threatening world across it.

				SAM
			(Cheerfully, as if 
			after a self-conscious 
			pause)
		I've been doing all the talking so 
		far, haven't I?

				NORMAN
		Yes.

				SAM
		I always thought it was the people 
		who are alone so much who do all the 
		talking when they get the chance. 
		Yet there you are, doing all the 
		listening!
			(A pause)
		You are alone here, aren't you?
			(As Norman does not 
			reply)
		It would drive me crazy.

				NORMAN
		That would be a rather extreme 
		reaction, wouldn't it?

				SAM
			(Lightly)
		Just an expression...
			(More seriously)
		What I meant was... I'd do just about 
		anything... to get away.  Wouldn't 
		you?

	INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRS OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila is halfway up the stairs. As she climbs she is startled 
	by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps. She 
	steps more carefully. CAMERA remains at foot of stair, TILTING 
	UP as Lila climbs. She pauses at the head of the stair. The 
	door on her right, which opens into the mother's room, is 
	closed. To her left is another door, half-open. Directly 
	before her is a third door, closed. She holds a long moment, 
	trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on 
	the front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door, 
	the one on her right. She goes to it, knocks lightly.

	INT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM (DAY) - CLOSE ANGLE ON DOOR

	We hear Lila's second knock, then, faintly, her soft call.

				LILA'S VOICE (O.S.)
		Mrs. Bates?

	There is quiet for a moment, then the door begins to open, 
	and we see Lila. She stands on the threshold, looking in at 
	the room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her 
	expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go 
	away from this room forever.

	After a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind 
	her. CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as 
	Lila sees it.

	It is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe, 
	an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of 
	the last century. The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the 
	dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a 
	great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full-
	length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite 
	the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the 
	window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled 
	with ashes.

	And there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if 
	even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long 
	vacated by some musty presence.

	Lila glances at the bed. The damask coverlet is thrown over 
	it, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on 
	it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb-
	like position. Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes 
	to the dressing table. Its top is scattered with boxes and 
	jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an 
	opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of 
	hair in its bristles. Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of 
	herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to 
	the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high 
	wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it, 
	hesitantly. She opens one door. Fresh, clean, well pressed 
	dresses hang neatly. Lila opens the other door. The sweaters 
	and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage-
	type bags. There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes.  
	Along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished 
	shoes. Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once 
	again over the whole room, starts out,

	INT. THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind 
	her, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to 
	the room whose door is half-open. The room within is dark, 
	the shades drawn full.

	Lila pauses on the threshold, reaches in, feels the wall, 
	throws on a switch.

	INT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)

	Sam has risen, is standing by the counter now.

				SAM
		I'm not saying you shouldn't be 
		contented here, I'm just doubting 
		that you are. I think if you saw a 
		chance to get out from under...  
		you'd unload this place...

				NORMAN
			(Angrily)
		This place! This isn't 'a place.'  
		It's my only world. I grew up in 
		that house back there. I was a happy 
		child. My mother and I... we were 
		more than happy.

				SAM
		And now that your mother's dead?

	Norman snaps a sharp, fast, ugly look at him.

				NORMAN
		My mother is not dead!

				SAM
			(Softly)
		I didn't think so.

	INT. NORMAN'S ROOM IN THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in sick 
	dismay. The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy 
	of childhood held beyond the point of decency.

	It is a small room. The walls are fancied with romping 
	silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and 
	fat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far 
	too short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpled 
	covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps.  
	Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top 
	there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an 
	ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown man's 
	shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree.

	Against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled 
	with thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white 
	chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The record 
	on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be 
	Beethoven's Eroica Symphony.

	Lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glances 
	at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcase 
	and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens 
	it. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust. 
	She slams the book closed, drops it.

	INT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)

	Norman, behind the counter, has moved back against the wall. 
	Sam is still on the other side of the counter, but is leaning 
	forward, his eyes hard on Norman's face.

	Norman's face is no longer expressionless. It has the stark, 
	high sheen of a cornered animal.

				SAM
			(Pressing)
		You look frightened. Have I been 
		saying something frightening?

				NORMAN
		I don't know what you've been saying.

				SAM
		I've been talking about your mother... 
		about your motel. How are you going 
		to do it?

				NORMAN
		Do what?

				SAM
		Buy a new one! In a new town!
		Where you won't have to hide your 
		mother!

				NORMAN
		Shut up!

				SAM
		Where will you get the money to do 
		that, Bates... or do you already 
		have it... socked away... a lot of 
		it...

				NORMAN
		Leave me alone!

				SAM
		...Forty thousand dollars!

				NORMAN
		Leave me alone!

	He is close to panic now. He turns, swiftly, dashes back 
	into his private parlor. Sam goes quickly around the counter, 
	follows.

	INT. NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)

	Norman hears Sam following, wants to run, to never be reached 
	by this man. He crosses the small room, drawn to the rear 
	window, as if he might fly through it. Sam enters, pauses.  
	Norman turns, back against the window, as unable to fly away 
	as are the many still, stuffed birds. Sam registers a brief 
	flicker of reaction when he sees the birds, but continues to 
	gaze at Norman, hard.

				SAM
		I bet your mother knows where the 
		money is. And what you did to get 
		it. And I think she'll tell us.

	Something self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives 
	Norman a new, more terrified alarm. He turns his head, glances 
	out the window at the old house. He looks back at Sam and 
	there is terror in his voice.

				NORMAN
		Where's that girl? The girl you came 
		with! Where is she?

	Sam does not respond, smiles a half-smile, turns to examine 
	a stuffed owl. Norman looks back at the house.

				NORMAN
			(A horrible groan)
		Oh, God!

	INT. UPSTAIRS HALL OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila, shaken and disturbed, almost sickened, is coming out 
	of Norman's room. She has left the light on. She pauses in 
	the middle of the landing, looks at the closed door opposite 
	the stairs, goes to it, opens it, sees that it is the 
	bathroom, pulls the door to, turns, starts toward the stairs.

	INT. NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)

	Sam is lying on the floor, face downward, unmoving. A 
	candlestick is on the floor, close by his head, still rocking 
	as if just dropped. OVER SHOT comes the SOUND of Norman's 
	footsteps and CAMERA TURNS in time to catch a brief glimpse 
	of him going out into the office, almost at a run.

	INT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila is on the top step, looking down toward CAMERA.

	She is listening, hoping to hear some human sound, some sound 
	she might follow, pursue. She hears nothing. She starts down 
	the stairs. Just below the halfway step, she looks at the 
	front door, sees out through the door window:

	LILA'S VIEWPOINT - (DAY)

	Norman coming.

	INT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	For a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps, 
	cannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the 
	stairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction. The 
	SOUND of Norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard. 
	Lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the 
	basement, going down far enough to conceal herself, crouching 
	there.

	Norman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listens. 
	He glances once in the direction of the basement stairs. He 
	seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes 
	from his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-time 
	state. He crosses to the stairway, goes up.

	Lila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to 
	the SOUNDS of Norman. His footsteps on the stairs followed 
	by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an 
	upstairs room. Convinced that he is searching the upstairs 
	for her, she decides to chance an escape. She starts up the 
	steps, is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is 
	caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement. She pauses, 
	looks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind the 
	not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar. The swift moving 
	SOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs.

	Lila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while 
	she has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to check 
	that hidden-looking room down below, a room in which, she 
	desperately believes, there must lie some answer to what 
	happened to Mary. She turns and goes softly and quickly down 
	the stairs.

	INT. THE BASEMENT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

	Lila reaches the bottom, stops, listens, hears the stairboards 
	creaking as footsteps fall hard and measured upon them. She 
	turns, pulls open the fruit cellar door, looks in. The woman 
	is sitting in a comfortable chair, the back of the chair, 
	and the woman, turned to the door. Lila calls a harsh, 
	frightened whisper.

				LILA
		Mrs. Bates...?

	Lila goes into the room.

	INT. THE FRUIT CELLAR

	Lila goes to the chair, touches it. The touch disturbs the 
	figure. It starts to turn, slowly, stiffly, a clock-wise 
	movement. Lila looks at it in horror. It is the body of a 
	woman long dead. The skin is dry and pulled away from the 
	mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile.  
	The eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose 
	has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are 
	sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and 
	flaky. The body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pressed 
	dress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed.

	The movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turning 
	as if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually 
	graceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obscene.

	Lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begins 
	to scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream.

	And Lila's scream is joined by another scream, a more 
	dreadful, horrifying scream which comes from the door behind 
	her.

				NORMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
			(screaming)
		Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma 
		Bates!

	Lila turns.

	NORMAN

	His face is contorted. He wears a wild wig, a mockery of a 
	woman's hair. He is dressed in a high-neck dress which is 
	similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother. His hand 
	is raised high, poised to strike at Lila. There is a long 
	breadknife in it.

	LILA

	Close on her face. She is dumb-struck. Her eyes are screaming.

	BACK TO NORMAN

	As he is about to start forward, a man's hand reaches in 
	from the doorway behind, grabs Norman's wrist. Sam comes 
	through the door, still holding tight to the wrist, pulling 
	back the arm and at the same time throwing himself at Norman, 
	football tackle style.

	SERIES OF CUTS - THE FIGHT

	Norman and Sam, struggling. The wild fury in Norman's face, 
	the mad noise of his screams and vile curses. The terrified, 
	fight-to-the-death look of Sam. The still, staring Lila.

	MRS. BATES

	A close of her face, She appears to be watching and enjoying 
	the fight. Over the shot, the SOUNDS of the struggle, the 
	screams of Norman.

						 DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. COURTHOUSE AT READING - (NIGHT)

	There are many people gathered about the steps, the curious 
	and the concerned and the morbid. At the curb, a couple of 
	newspaper cars, two or three police cars, and a mobile unit 
	truck from the local television outlet. There is noise, and 
	chattering as questions are asked and answers given, and the 
	sounds of traffic, and of the television equipment being 
	moved into the courthouse, for on-the-scene reporting, and 
	the stern voices of policemen trying to keep people back. 
	The scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden 
	light thrown on a fearful darkness.

	CLOSER ANGLE ON STEPS OF COURTHOUSE

	A POLICEMAN trying to make way for the television men, 
	muttering "keep back," etc., to the spectators. A TELEVISION 
	MAN, carrying a piece of equipment goes through door, and 
	CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the courthouse vestibule.

	Here, too, there is a crowd, composed of Policemen, Reporters, 
	Television Men. The Television Men we have been following 
	stops beside a Policeman.

				TELEVISION MAN
			(Indicating the front 
			door he has just 
			come in through)
		You think they'll take him out that 
		way?

				POLICEMAN
			(Looking at waiting 
			crowd, shrugging)
		Probably have to.
			(A rueful smile)
		Besides, the taxpayers hate it when 
		something gets slipped out the back 
		door on them!

	Over this exchange, the buzz of other voices, the movement 
	of men. CAMERA MOVES ON, down the corridor, gets to the door 
	of the office of the Chief of Police just as a young fellow 
	with a carton box filled with paper containers of sent-out-
	for coffee reaches this door. CAMERA HOLDS as the COFFEE BOY 
	pauses a moment, then goes into the room.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE - (NIGHT)

	Lila is seated in a chair, Sam standing close by. A bit apart 
	from them, we see Sheriff Chambers, in quiet conference with 
	the CHIEF OF POLICE, the COUNTY SHERIFF, the DISTRICT 
	ATTORNEY.

	The Coffee Boy stands in the doorway. Sam goes to him, takes 
	a container of coffee from the box, carries it to Lila, 
	checking the notation on the lid as he goes.

	MED. CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA

				SAM
			(quietly)
		It's regular. Okay?

				LILA
			(ruefully)
		I could stand something regular.

	Sam smiles encouragingly, hands her the coffee. Sheriff 
	Chambers ENTERS SHOT, gives Sam a container of coffee he has 
	brought for him. Sam takes it, nods a thank you.

	For a moment no one speaks. Lila looks badly shaken, Sam 
	disheveled, but contained.

				CHAMBERS
		You two can go on home if you like.
			(a sympathetic look 
			at Lila)
		Making that statement was enough for 
		one night.

				SAM
			(to Lila)
		Want to?

				LILA
		No. I'm all right. I'll feel better 
		when all this is explained... if it 
		can be.

	Sam looks a question at Sheriff Chambers. Chambers shrugs 
	doubtfully.

				CHAMBERS
		If anybody gets any answers, it'll 
		be the fellow talking to him now... 
		the Psychiatrist. Even I couldn't 
		reach Norman... and he knows me.
			(to Lila)
		You warm enough, Miss?

	Lila is about to answer, when she sees someone come into the 
	room and rises anxiously. Sam and Sheriff Chambers turn, 
	follow her gaze.

	INT. OFFICE OF CHIEF OF POLICE - FULL SHOT

	A young man with a serious, frowning face has just come into 
	the room. He is DR. SIMON, the Psychiatrist.

	He goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has 
	been placed, takes up a container.

				DISTRICT ATTORNEY
		Did he talk to you?

				SIMON
		No. I got the whole story... but not 
		from Norman. I got it from... his 
		mother.

	Everyone gazes at him, mystified. He speaks as he removes 
	lid from coffee container.

				SIMON
		Norman Bates no longer exists. He 
		only half-existed to begin with...  
		now, the other half has taken over.  
		Probably for all time.

				LILA
			(With difficulty)
		Did he kill my sister?

				SIMON
		Yes... and no.

				DISTRICT ATTORNEY
		Look, if you're trying to lay a lot 
		of psychiatric groundwork for some 
		sort of plea this fellow would like 
		to cop...

				SIMON
		A psychiatrist doesn't lay the 
		groundwork .. he merely tries to 
		explain it.

				LILA
		But my sister is...

				SIMON
		Yes. I'm sorry.
			(to Chambers)
		The Private Investigator, too. If 
		you drag that swamp somewhere in the 
		vicinity of the motel...
			(To the Chief of Police)
		Have you any unsolved missing persons 
		cases on your books?

				CHIEF OF POLICE
		Yes. Two.

				SIMON
		Young girls?

				CHIEF OF POLICE
			(nods, astounded, 
			then:)
		Did he confess to...

				SIMON
			(interrupting)
		As I said, the mother...
			(Pauses, goes on afresh)
		To understand it, as I understood it 
		hearing it from the mother...  That 
		is, from the mother-half of Norman's 
		mind, you have to go back ten years... 
		to the time when Norman murdered his 
		mother and her lover.
			(A pause, then as no 
			one interrupts)
		He was already dangerously disturbed, 
		had been ever since his father died. 
		His mother was a clinging, demanding 
		woman... and for years the two of 
		them lived as if there was no one 
		else in the world. Then she met a 
		man and it seemed to Norman she "threw 
		him over" for this man. That pushed 
		him over the thin line... and he 
		killed them both. Matricide is 
		probably the most unbearable crime 
		of all... and most unbearable to the 
		son who commit it. So he had to erase 
		the crime, at least in his own mind.
			(A pause)
		He stole her corpse... and a weighted 
		coffin was buried. He hid the body 
		in the fruit cellar, even "treated" 
		it to keep it as well as it would 
		keep. And that still wasn't enough. 
		She was there, but she was a corpse.  
		So he began to think and speak for 
		her, gave her half his life, so to 
		speak. At times he could be both 
		personalities, carry on 
		conversations... at other times, the 
		mother-half took over completely. He 
		was never all Norman, but he was 
		often only mother. And because he 
		was so pathologically jealous of 
		her, he assumed she was as jealous 
		of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong 
		attraction to any other woman, the 
		mother side of him would go wild.
			(To Lila)
		When Norman met your sister, he was 
		touched by her... and aroused by 
		her. He wanted her. And this set off 
		his "jealous mother" and...  "mother 
		killed the girl." After the murder, 
		Norman returned as if from a deep 
		sleep... and like a dutiful son, 
		covered up all traces of the crime 
		he was convinced his mother had 
		committed.

				SAM
		Why was he... dressed like that?

				DISTRICT ATTORNEY
		He's a transvestite!

				SIMON
		Not exactly. A man who dresses in 
		woman's clothing in order to achieve 
		a sexual change... or satisfaction... 
		is a transvestite.  But in Norman's 
		case, he was simply doing everything 
		possible to keep alive the illusion 
		of his mother being alive. And 
		whenever reality came too close, 
		when danger or desire threatened 
		that illusion, he'd dress up, even 
		to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd 
		walk about the house, sit in her 
		chair, speak in her voice... He tried 
		to be his mother.
			(A sad smile)
		And now he is.
			(A pause)
		That's what I meant when I said I 
		got the story from the mother. She 
		thinks Norman has been taken away... 
		because of his crimes.  She insists 
		she did nothing, that Norman committed 
		all the murders just to keep her 
		from being discovered. She even smiled 
		a bit coquettishly as she said that. 
		Of course, she feels badly about 
		it... but also somewhat relieved to 
		be, as she put it, free of Norman, 
		at last.
			(A pause)
		When the mind houses two 
		personalities, there is always a 
		battle. In Norman's case, the battle 
		is over... and the dominant 
		personality has won.

	Lila begins to weep softly, for Mary, for Arbogast, for 
	Norman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world. 
	Sam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts her.

				CHAMBERS
			(To Simon)
		And the forty thousand dollars?  Who 
		got that?

				SIMON
		The swamp. These were murders of 
		passion, not profit.

	A POLICE GUARD puts his head in the door, speaks, in a near-
	whisper, to the Chief of Police. The Guard is carrying a 
	folded blanket over his arm.

				POLICE GUARD
		He feels a little chill... can I 
		bring him this blanket?

	The Chief of Police nods. The Guard goes away, and CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS him out of the room and out into the hallway. Guard 
	moves through the waiting men, heading down the corridor.

							 CUT TO:

	INT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR IN COURTHOUSE

	A narrower corridor in the rear of the building. In f.g. of 
	shot, we see a door, the top half of which is wire-covered 
	glass. A GUARD in uniform is posted by the door, looking 
	reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance 
	into the room.

	The Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this 
	corridor, goes to the door. CAMERA MOVES CLOSE. The uniformed 
	Guard opens the door, allows the man to go in.

	Shot is RAKED so that we can not see into the room.

	After a moment, the Guard comes out and the uniformed Guard 
	closes and locks the door and we

							 CUT TO:

	INT. NORMAN'S DETENTION ROOM - (NIGHT)

	The walls are white and plain. There is no window.

	There is no furniture except the straight-back chair in which 
	Norman sits, in the center of the room. The room has a quality 
	of no-whereness, of calm separation from the world.

	The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees. 
	Norman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding 
	it. His face, although without makeup and without the 
	surrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity 
	about it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch 
	womanliness about the brows.

	Calmly, Norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as if 
	it were a cashmere shawl. CAMERA REMAINS in a position so 
	that our view of Norman is a FULL ONE. When the shawl is in 
	position, and Norman is settled, we HEAR, OVER SHOT, the 
	voice of his mother, coming from the calm of his thoughts.

				MOTHER'S VOICE (O.S.)
		It's sad... when a mother has to 
		speak the words that condemn her own 
		son... but I couldn't allow them to 
		believe that I would commit murder.
			(A pause)
		They'll put him away now... as I 
		should have... years ago. He was 
		always... bad. And in the end, he 
		intended to tell them I killed those 
		girls... and that man. As if I could 
		do anything except just sit and 
		stare... like one of his stuffed 
		birds.
			(A pause)
		Well, they know I can't even move a 
		finger. And I won't. I'll just sit 
		here and be quiet. Just in case they 
		do... suspect me.

	A fly buzzes close, and then continues buzzing and flying 
	about Norman's face.

				MOTHER'S VOICE (V.O.)
		They're probably watching me.  Well, 
		let them. Let them see what kind of 
		a person I am.
			(A pause, as the fly 
			lights on Norman's 
			hand)
		I'm not going to swat that fly. I 
		hope they are watching. They'll see... 
		they'll see... and they'll know... 
		and they'll say... 'why, she wouldn't 
		even harm a fly...'

	Norman continues to gaze ahead into nothing.

					SCENE BEGINS TO DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO:

	THE SWAMP

	As END TITLES FADE IN, we see the swamp, the chain of a tow-
	truck. The chain is attached to Mary's car. The car is coming 
	out of the swamp.

    FADE IN:

1   EXT. LAFAYETTE CEMETERY (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT               1

    An empty breeze blows across a deserted cemetery. We
    hear the sound of FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING, then nineteenth-
    century boots ENTER FRAME. We FOLLOW them strolling past
    the headstones and mausoleums. The sound of a HORSE and
    CARRIAGE ECHOES in the distance.

                             VOICE (V.O.)
               There comes a time for every vampire
               when the idea of eternity becomes
               momentarily unbearable...

    As we REACH an old stone tomb, the boots leap up and OUT
    OF FRAME. PAN UP to reveal:

    A FIGURE stands steadily atop the roof of the tomb,
    silhouetted against the moon like a large, black bird.

                       VOICE (V.O.)
               The wounds suffered from love and
               failed friendships don't heal like
               a human's, but seem to only gape
               larger. The longing to be mortal
               returns, a longing for finiteness.

    A beat as the indistinct figure gazes out at the night...

                                                  CUT TO:

4   EXT. TOMB - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               4

    The figure enters an alabaster tomb and closes the door.

                        VOICE (V.O.)
               In 1883 I suffered such a spell
               and decided to cease feeding on
               blood. Just lie in the earth and
               let time return to its natural
               state...

    As the WIND PICKS UP, the LEAVES of a fledgling vine
    growing up the side of the tomb begin to RATTLE FASTER
    and FASTER, until curiously, time seems to speed up.
    Night passes to day and back to night. Shadows from the
    sun and moon drift across the tomb. As days and months
    fly by, the vine winds and grows in circuitous patterns
    all around the tomb.

                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                             2.

4   CONTINUED:                                                    4

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                 I had hoped the sounds of the
                 passing eras would fade out, and a
                 kind of death might happen. A
                 kind of forgetting where I would
                 be healed from my wounds.

    The CLIP-CLOP of HORSES and the SQUEAK of PERAMBULATORS
    DISSOLVE INTO the THUMP and SCRAPE of INDUSTRIAL ENGINES.

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                 But as I lay there, the sounds
                 didn't fade but grew with the
                 world.

    The BUZZ of PROP ENGINES MELT INTO the sound of a JET
    STREAMING overhead. CARS, MACHINES, RADIO BROADCASTS
    MERGE INTO a medley of MUSIC from this century -- JACK
    BENNY, MUDDY WATERS, ELVIS, HENDRIX, SEX PISTOLS.

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                 And gradually the world didn't
                 sound like the place I had left,
                 but something different...
                 better...

    As we DRAW CLOSER TO the now vine-covered tomb, SOUNDS of
    the '70s, '80s, '90s PERSIST...

                         VOICE (V.O.)
                 A new fearless attitude had
                 possessed the world, brave and
                 Godless. I began to wonder if it
                 was not time to resurrect. But
                 the thing that eventually brought
                 me back -- the decisive thing
                 really -- came like a bolt out of
                 the blue.

    GUITARS STRIKE, DRUMS CRACK and the MUSIC SLAMS OUT, raw
    and dark.


5   SERIES OF GLIMPSES                                            5

    Slender hands with long, painted nails, Gothic rings, and
    a half-pound of silver bracelets play their instruments.
    Long hair, body piercings, Celtic tattoos, and brightly- colored
    nylons show a lot of pale, smooth flesh. In the
    confusion of glimpses, it's hard to tell who's a boy or
    girl, but they're all young and beautiful. Breaking in
    on the CACOPHONY of MUSIC COMES ONE GUITAR CLOSER and
    LOUDER than the rest.

5    CONTINUED:                                                  5

     A SCRAPING ROAR, like a bandsaw being twisted into the
     most gorgeous, powerful chords, almost religious in its
     emotion.

                          VOICE (V.O.)
                  A music so sublime, so deeply
                  vampiric, I had no doubt it could
                  be heard in Hades. I had no
                  choice... it summoned me.

     An ULTRA-FAST TECHNO BEAT BEGINS and the FULL-SOUND of a
     BAND RUSHES in, creating a sense of vertigo with its
     energy.


6    INT. TOMB                                                   6

     The BAND'S sounds ECHO about the stone chamber, thrumming
     a deep, life-giving pulse. Suddenly, the LID of a
     SARCOPHAGUS SCRAPES and slides to one side.


7    EXT. LAFAYETTE CEMETERY (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT               7

     The Figure re-emerges from the tomb, his cape now in
     tatters -- posture bent. He creeps across the cemetery
     in unnatural, staccato movements as if hindered by the
     physics of distance and time. All the while the SONG
     plays, drawing the figure toward it.


8    EXT. FRENCH QUARTER - NIGHT                                 8

     The Figure moves through the shadows avoiding the spill
     of yellow light from the street lamps. Stopping in a
     darkened alleyway, he gasps for air, exhausted by his movements.
      He listens again to the mesmeric TUNE of the
     band in the distance, when -- From down the alley, a
     voice...

                          VOICE #2 (O.S.)
                     (in French; subtitled)
                  Need a fix?


9    CLOSE ON FIGURE'S EYES                                      9

     staring hungrily at...


10   BACK TO SCENE                                               10

     A MAN proffering a little parcel wrapped in foil.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                              4.

10   CONTINUED:                                                    10

     Pulling deeper into the shadows, the caped Figure beckons
     the dealer over. The man approaches when -- With a wild
     animal cry, the Figure lunges like a phantom -- A flash of teeth
     -- The Dealer is on the ground -- the Figure set
     upon him. OVER this scene the BAND'S SONG RUSHES IN LOUD again,
     reaching an incredible CRESCENDO as the violent
     frenzy continues -- the monster gnawing at the Dealer's
     neck.


11   CLOSE ON FIGURE'S HAND                                        11

     Its vein refilling with the flow of warm blood -- skin
     regaining a youthful tautness.


12   WIDER                                                         12

     Rising from his victim we see for the first time the
     revitalized face of this creature, a mane of blond hair
     frames the beautiful features of the VAMPIRE LESTAT --
     his bulbous lips glistening red.

                           LESTAT (V.O.)
                  Whether it was that first meal,
                  the music, or the 100 years of
                  rest, I'm not sure, but suddenly I
                  was feeling better than ever. My
                  appetite for living was voracious.
                  My hearing so exact I could locate
                  precisely the source of the
                  music...


13   EXT. NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT                                13

     In the street, Lestat emerges from the shadows in the
     dealer's snug-fitting leather outfit. He looks up at an
     extremely run-down flophouse...

                          LESTAT (V.O.)
                  My old house.

     High in the attic, a single window glows with dim light.
     The source of the MUSIC. The whole house is shaking from
     the sound of the BAND playing upstairs.


14   INT. ATTIC - JUST AFTER                                       14

     The room booms with music, speakers stacked high on all
     sides, literally shaking the house to its foundations.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                           5.

14   CONTINUED:                                                  14

     REVEAL the band members of Satan's Night Out. JAMES,
     ALEX and MAUDY stare at each other as if in some tantric
     trance, as they play their music -- Alex's long fingers
     climbing up and down his guitar, Maudy's waifish body
     sensually curls around her keyboard, the waves of music
     flowing through them while James, on drums, drives them
     further into it.

                          LESTAT (V.O.)
                  It was hard to believe these
                  beings were mortal -- so confident
                  in their skin. Everything in my
                  body wanted to be with them. I
                  couldn't help myself.

     Then, from somewhere in the room, an ANGELIC VOICE begins
     to hum the most hypnotic melody over the tune, melding in
     exquisite harmony. Arching her neck in some higher
     ecstasy, Maudy looks across the makeshift studio and
     suddenly stops playing.

                          ALEX
                  What the hell, Maudy.

     Seeing Maudy's stunned face, Alex and James turn to see
     Lestat perched like a raven on top of the stack of
     speakers, eyes closed, still humming to the fading reverb
     of the guitars. Slowly opening his cool grey eyes --

                          LESTAT
                  Please don't stop.

                          JAMES
                  What the f-- How did you get in
                  here?

                          LESTAT
                  The door, of course.

     James and Alex look at the door on the other side of the
     attic -- they should have seen him. Maudy stares at
     Lestat, quite taken by the handsome vampire's looks --
     Drinking Maudy in with his eyes --

                          LESTAT
                  Your music woke me from the
                  longest sleep. It's sublime. In
                  two hundred years I've never heard
                  anything quite like it.

                          ALEX
                  Who the hell are you?

                                            (CONTINUED)

                          LESTAT (V.O.)
                  The question provoked an
                  irresistible urge...

                          LESTAT
                  You may call me the vampire Lestat.

     As we REMAIN ON the stunned looks of the band's faces --

                          LESTAT (V.O.)
                  It just rolled out of my mouth.
                  With one simple sentence I had
                  betrayed everything about my kind.
                  Betrayed our code of secrecy.

                          LESTAT
                  Your struggles are over.

     Suddenly from across the room --

                          LESTAT
                  All that you've ever dreamed of
                  will be yours.

     They spin around to see Lestat now right behind them,
     smiling.

                                ALEX
                         (terrified)
                  What the hell is this?

                          LESTAT
                  Your lucky day.

     They all stare at him, faces white.     A beat.     Then James
     breaks into a big smile.

                                 JAMES
                  Cool.   We got our very own vampire.

     Maudy and Alex look at each other getting used to it.
     They break into smiles, going with it.

                                MAUDY
                  Hey, Vampire Lestat, I've always
                  wondered... about Keith Richards...

                          LESTAT (V.O.)
                  It was a bold move, I admit. But
                  from that moment on, they were my
                  friends, my children, my band.
                  Together we rode on the wave of my
                  preternatural ambition to
                  superstardom, giving the world a
                  new god... me.

     We COME ACROSS the city lights of London. Below, police
     cars section off a few blocks around a very sleek,
     ultramodern office building where a huge crowd has
     gathered.

     SUPERIMPOSE:    LONDON (6 MONTHS LATER)


16   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS ACTION                      16

     Through the crowd, a very long, black limousine snakes
     its way toward the building. Rows of fans dressed as
     Goths, ghouls and vampires scream out...

                            FANS
                  Lestat!    Lestat!

     Girls press their breasts and necks up against the
     limousine. Thump! Thump! Fan after female fan flings
     herself on the car. Groupies scream with pure
     excitement.

     Confusion of screams as the door to the limo opens. The
     crowd's scream reaches a fever pitch as... James, Alex
     and Maudy climb out, ogle at the sight. ROGER SMYTHE,
     their business manager (40s), gets out next, hustling
     them through the crowd.

     A wave of hysteria hits the fans. Roger hustles the
     band through the crowd and up the stairs into the church,
     past the giant billboard with their own images written
     huge, Lestat's smiling face above them all and the
     announcement --

     LESTAT -- LIVE & UNDEAD -- OCTOBER 31, ALL HALLOW'S EVE,
     DEATH VALLEY, U.S.A.


17   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - SOON AFTER                             17

     A high-tech conference room. The band, sitting up front,
     is faced by an audience of over fifty journalists and
     then another fifty photographers and TV cameras. The
     room crackles with anticipation. Roger steps to the
     podium.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                          ROGER
                  May I present the Vampire Lestat.

     He pushes a button and a black curtain slides open to
     reveal a huge monitor on the wall.

     Every eye is glued to the SCREEN... CRACKLE, CRACKLE.
     Nothing. Then suddenly, on the screen, a face in shadow
     appears... Lestat. His voice booms out over the crowd.

                          LESTAT
                  Good evening. I'm so sorry I'm
                  late. I was just having my...
                  breakfast.

     Then Lestat leans forward into the light. Hushed
     whispers move through the crowd. Lestat's eyes burn
     unnaturally bright. His white skin absolutely glows,
     luminous. Lestat smiles out at them with a tight smile.
     Then grins wider, revealing his fangs.

                          JOURNALIST
                  Excellent makeup job.   Marilyn
                  Manson, look out...

     A thousand questions suddenly burst out of the
     journalists.

                          ROGER
                  Hey, hey! We're gonna keep this
                  short here! One at a time. You!

     He points to a PRETTY FRENCH JOURNALIST.

                          PRETTY FRENCH JOURNALIST
                  So, Lestat. You say you're a
                  real vampire. Correct me if I'm
                  wrong, but what I remember about
                  vampires is you guys usually keep
                  your identity secret.

                          LESTAT
                  Yes. But why hide it in this day
                  and age? I've hidden in the
                  shadows for centuries. It's time
                  to share myself with the world.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                             9.

     In the corner, Roger gives a big winking smile to the
     camera crew. The journalists smile, playing along. A
     younger, hipper MUSIC magazine JOURNALIST pipes in...

                          MUSIC JOURNALIST
                  And it doesn't hurt the record
                  sales, huh? Your album just
                  topped all kinds of sales records.

                          LESTAT
                  Our label isn't complaining, no.

                                PRETTY FRENCH JOURNALIST
                  Could you prove it? You know give
                  us a demonstration of your powers?

                          LESTAT
                  If you like, I'll give you a
                  private demonstration in your
                  hotel room tonight.

     The journalists laugh. The French Journalist looks a
     little frightened/fascinated by Lestat's leer.

                                LIFESTYLE JOURNALIST
                  Why not a demo at your own house?
                  I mean, what's with all the
                  secrecy about where you stay? Is
                  it true you move residences every
                  few days?

                                LESTAT
                         (smiles, giving away
                          nothing)
                  After calling one stone tomb home
                  sweet home for so long, I like to
                  experience as much diversity as I
                  can. Wouldn't you?

     The Lifestyle Journalist smiles.

                          MUSIC JOURNALIST
                  There are a lot of rumors flying
                  around the internet about the
                  hidden meaning in your lyrics,
                  that you're giving away 'vampire
                  secrets.' Something in all that?

     CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to reveal...

     A group of dangerous-looking vampires dressed in various
     styles, staring stony-faced up at the screen, their eyes
     glowing strangely in the ultra-violet light. The pool
     player is in the b.g. Other vampires, dressed in black, eyes
     cold as ice, stare up at the TV.

                             VAMPIRE #1
               Goddamn fool's going to bring back
               the Inquisition.

                             VAMPIRE #2
               I say we kill him, before this
               gets out of hand. Bleed him dry.

                             VAMPIRE #1
               Gotta find him first. Elusive
               bloke. Never know where he's
               going to turn up.

                             VAMPIRE #2
               Well we know one place he's
               definitely going to be...

     Next to him sits a female VAMPIRE, Evian bottle in hand.

                              VAMPIRE #1
               When I was in Manchester, the coven
               there was saying exactly the same
               thing. That we should nail him at
               the concert...

                             FEMALE VAMPIRE #1
               I don't know, if he's as old as
               they say, he's gotta be pretty
               strong... If you came within a
               mile of him, he'd eat you alive.

     She brings her Evian bottle to her lips.   Drinks heartily.
     The liquid inside glistens deep red.

                             VAMPIRE #1
               Yes. Well let's see how he
               handles a thousand of us at once.

     Crack -- the pool player sinks the last ball on the pool
     table. The TV suddenly EXPLODES.

      All alone in his magnificent chateau. He sits in front
      of a video camera and monitor set up for the two-way remote
      feed. Lestat puts the remote down.

      Laughs out loud with the pure pleasure of it all. He stands,
      crosses to huge doors. Opens them. Goes out to...

      Lestat walks across his lavish grounds, gazes up into the
      night.

      Staring up at the dark heavens, Lestat inhales like an
      emperor taking in his kingdom, stretches his arms out, still
      drinking in the adulation.

      Slowly, his grin fades...

      A melancholy look comes over Lestat.

     A beautiful young woman, JESSE, 22, lays in black satin
     sheets. Her long red hair snakes over her slender neck as
     she sleeps to Lestat's voice, still as death. Flickering
     candles all over the room reveal her lithe, strong body,
     pale as the moon. She is surrounded by her work, ancient
     language books, her laptop computer. Another book is
     clenched in her hand. The Unconscious Vampire. We MOVE
     IN ON her fluttering eyes.

     long red curls. LAUGHTER wafts in with the breeze.


28   INT. CORRIDOR                                                  28

     Jesse's bare feet pad down the endless corridor. The
     little girl is dwarfed by the stone pedestals, all lit
     with candles. LAUGHTER ECHOES through the halls.


29   INT. GREAT HALL                                                29

     Jesse moves past rough-hewn columns, watching something
     with great curiosity. Behind her, we glimpse a giant
     mural of names cut into the stone walls. A family tree,
     extending up onto the ceiling and down to the floor.


30   JESSE'S POV                                                    30

     A grand party is in progress. There are about thirty
     vampires, all thin, pale and beautiful. An eclectic
     group, elegantly-dressed in Indian silks, Arabic veils,
     mixed with a few gaudy Versace outfits. Guests lean into
     each other's necks, showing blood-red tongues and fangs.


31   BACK TO SCENE                                                  31

     A young VAMPIRE scoops Jesse up and puts her on his knee.

                          VAMPIRE
                  Ah, Jesse. You want to come and
                  play with us, don't you?

     She stares at him, nervous, intrigued.

                          WOMAN (O.S.)
                     (urgent)
                  Jesse!

                          VAMPIRE
                  Soon, soon, little one. I'll make
                  sure you're with us forever.

                          WOMAN (O.S.)
                     (more urgent)
                  Jesse!


32   INT. JESSE'S BEDROOM (PRESENT)                              32

                          JESSE
                  No!

     Jesse sits up with a start. She stands, heart pounding,
     trying to shake the dream off. We see on a bulletin board
     behind her, a flyer for Lestat's concert. She takes off
     the headphones. Walking over to the mantel above her
     fireplace, she picks up a solitary, framed photo -- holds
     it tight...


33   CLOSEUP - PHOTO                                             33

     Young Jesse (the girl from the dream) stares straight at
     camera. She is held in the arms of a red-haired woman,
     her back to camera.


34   BACK TO SCENE                                               34

     Jesse puts the photo down, catches her reflection in a
     mirror, lit by flickering candlelight. Her face is
     distressed, troubled by the dream. She goes to the
     window, stares out into the black night. The dark waters
     of the Thames snake through the London cityscape. Jesse
     blows out the candles. Darkness.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           15.

35   EXT. TUBE STATION (LONDON) - THAT NIGHT                      35

     Fluorescence pierces the black night. Jesse comes out
     of the tube station in a tight, short skirt, boots. She
     looks down the street. In one direction, a busy,
     brightly-lit street. Jesse gazes at a group of tourists
     coming out of a pub, laughing. Then she turns, looks the
     other direction. A dark street. She hesitates a long
     moment, stares at the light, then can't help herself,
     plunges toward the darkness, the LAUGHTER ECHOING, then
     DYING.


36   EXT. ALLEY - JUST AFTER                                      36

     Jesse passes "rent-boys" stepping from the shadows as
     cars cruise by. Jesse, unable to look away, gazes as one
     gets in a car. He stares back at her, disappears into
     the car.


37   EXT. BRIDGE - JUST AFTER                                     37

     Jesse passes couples using the shadows for privacy in the
     dark, filthy streets. She strides past a girl leaning
     against a brick wall, the man grunting, moving
     rhythmically against her.


38   EXT. LONDON STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT                        38

     Fog floats in the yellow vapor lights. Jesse pauses at
     the intersection of a narrow alley. She hesitates,
     nervous, then turns down the dark lane, disappearing into
     the blackness...


39   EXT. WAVERLY ARMS - NIGHT                                    39

     Jesse, from the shadows, gazes, wide-eyed, at the Soho
     private club's entrance, a solitary door with a faded sign
     and a dull blue light mounted above.

     Jesse hears strange whispering. She sees now figures
     moving through the fog. One pushes a buzzer. Jesse stares,
     barely breathing, her heart pounding.

     The figures have white, luminescent faces, strange, bright,
     glowing eyes. Their fingernails are glass-like. A moment
     later, a slot in the door opens. The glowing eyes of another
     creature stares out at them, scrutinizing them. The door
     closes quickly.

     Jesse stands there, deliberating. She takes a step closer
     to the door. Stops. Takes another nervous step. She hears
     something, whirls around.

                                             (CONTINUED)

39   CONTINUED:                                                       39

     Another group of the strange figures walk steadily down the
     street towards her. Jesse begins backing away. A HISSING
     sound slowly fills the alley...

                                                      CUT TO:


     CLOSE ON LESTAT

     smiling, revealing his fangs.

     REVEAL we are...


40   INT. LIBRARY - TALAMASCA INNER COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT           40

     Lestat's face appears on a video screen in front of a room
     lined from floor to ceiling with leather-bound books, ancient
     scrolls. Subjects are marked, Werewolves, Poltergeists,
     Possession...

     SUPERIMPOSE:    SECRET ORDER OF THE TALAMASCA: CENTER FOR
                     PARANORMAL STUDIES: LONDON HEADQUARTERS

     Jesse, making a presentation, stands before an impressive
     and imposing group of 10 TALAMASCANS, wearing demure
     suits.

     Jesse is excited, a bit nervous, hoping to impress. She
     holds a remote which controls images appearing on the
     large video screen. Clips from Lestat's press conference
     continue. Jesse gazes out at the Talamascans.

                                JESSE
                  I have reason to believe Lestat's
                  the real thing. A vampire. And
                  an ancient one.

                                TALAMASCAN #1
                  I don't know, Jesse. It looks to
                  me like the guy's got a good P.R.
                  man with a flair for the
                  theatrical.

                                JESSE
                         (leans forward,
                          eagerly)
                  It would appear that way. But
                  have you listened to his songs?
                  Read his lyrics?

     The Talamascans glance at each other, surprised. Shake
     their heads. A few laugh. They're not Lestat's usual
     audience.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                            17.

40   CONTINUED:                                                   40

                                JESSE
                  Well,i have. In one of his songs
                  he refers to a pub called the
                  Sailor's Arms. I think it's a
                  clue...

     She pushes a button, the lyrics appear on screen.

                                 JESSE
                         (reading screen)
                  'Where are you now? Back in the
                  sailor's arms, somewhere in the
                  back streets of Soho?' I tracked
                  down the old leases in London. It
                  turns out, in the late 1700's,
                  there was a pub right in the
                  backstreets of Soho called the
                  Sailor's Arms.

     The lyrics on screen are replaced now by an old engraving
     of a pub with the sign reading "SAILOR'S ARMS."

                                 JESSE
                  And it had a reputation for
                  dealing with black magic.
                  Witches' covens, seances, that
                  sort of thing.

     Quick flashes of gruesome drawings appear -- animal
     sacrifices. A corpses floating above a table...

     Jesse talks faster and faster with her enthusiasm.

                                JESSE
                  And most importantly, reports of
                  people being lured there and
                  subsequently attacked by
                  bloodsucking fiends.

     Quick flashes of gruesome period newspaper drawings,
     blood pouring from the neck of a screaming woman. A
     white-faced ghoul with fangs.

     Jesse is smiling wider, excited by her discovery.

     On screen, an old map of London appears.

                                JESSE
                  Here's where you could find the
                  Sailor's Arms in old London.

     A modern map appears, overlaying the old map.

                                JESSE
                  And here is where it would be
                  today. Of course the Sailor's
                  Arms is not there anymore. That
                  part of London is mostly old
                  warehouses, meat-packing plants.

                                TALAMASCAN #2
                  In a few years it will be artists'
                  lofts and pretentious French
                  cafes...

     Jesse leans forward now as she talks.

                                JESSE
                  Yes, but right now there's only
                  one place to get a drink -- of
                  sorts. A private club -- in
                  exactly the same place. The
                  Waverly Arms.

     On screen, a photo of the Waverly Arms.

                                JESSE
                  Well, what happens at the Waverly
                  Arms now makes the Sailor's Arms
                  look like a Happy Meal at
                  McDonald's.

     She pauses for emphasis, gazing at the faces of the
     Talamascans, gauging their reactions.

                                JESSE
                  It's a vampire coven. And
                  Lestat's leading us to it.

     Murmurs. Many of definite interest. Some of definite
     skepticism. Jesse's face shines bright with her
     enthusiasm.

                                TALAMASCAN #1
                         (skeptical)
                  And what makes you think so?

     Jesse smiles. Pushes a button.     Ready to receive the
     Talamascans' approval.

     On screen, a new picture appears of several figures,
     white faces, dark clothes -- but they're very blurry.

                                TALAMASCAN #2
                  Jesse, can you, uh, focus that any
                  better?

                          by embarrassment)
                  Well... it was taken... while...
                         (clears throat)
                  ... in motion.

     Talamascan #2 smiles at her sympathetically. Jesse gazes
     out at the other Talamascans, sees she's losing their
     interest.

                                 JESSE
                         (quickly, trying to
                          cover)
                  But listen, if you look closely,
                  you can see they're vampires. I'm
                  sure of it. And Lestat's leading
                  us to them and --

                                TALAMASCAN #3
                         (interrupting)
                  Interesting. Perhaps we should
                  assign someone to observe --

                                TALAMASCAN #1
                  Oh please, based on this so-called
                  'data'? That's a waste of time.

                                  JESSE
                  But... uh...

                           moment, interrupting)
                  Wait a second. Who took this
                  picture?

                                  JESSE
                           (a beat, softly)
                  I did.

     Murmurs bubble through the entire group now.      They stare
     at Jesse, dismayed.

                                TALAMASCAN #2
                  You went there?

                                 JESSE
                  Yes.   Last night.

                         (quickly)
                  Look, I know it was breaking
                  protocol and I'm really sorry,
                  it's just I think --

                                TALAMASCAN #1
                  Jesse! You're just an apprentice
                  here! You must follow our
                  rules... Or perhaps we need to
                  reconsider your position.

     She stares at him.

                                TALAMASCAN #3
                  For 12 centuries our mission as
                  Talamascans has been to observe
                  and record paranormal behavior.
                  But never get involved. You're
                  getting far too close.

                  Hey, does it look like I got
                  involved? That is not called
                  involvement. That is called
                  running.

                          trying to help)
                  But, Jesse, tell us, what did you
                  see?

     Jesse turns to her.

                                 JESSE
                  Vampires.   Gathering.   I'm sure of
                  it.

     Jesse steps from the podium, moving through the
     Talamascans as she pleads her case. She talks a mile a
     minute, her passion rising...

                                 JESSE
                  You have to listen to Lestat's
                  lyrics. They're amazing.

                          JESSE (CONT'D)
                  Many of the references could only
                  be derived from years of research
                  in the Bibliotech de Paris, which
                  seems unlikely for a young rock
                  star in his early twenties. Plus
                  there are historical details
                  dating back hundreds of years
                  Lestat describes that don't exist
                  anywhere... except in our library.
                  He refers to Marius, the great
                  white lord, who ruled over a group
                  of islands off the Bay of Naples
                  in the late 18th Century. What
                  I'm trying to say here, and maybe
                  I'm not doing the best job of it,
                  is that Lestat may be the oldest
                  and most powerful vampire ever
                  documented!

     Jesse sees some of the Talamascans are again listening.
     But Talamascan #1 shakes his head...

                                TALAMASCAN #1
                  It doesn't make any sense. Why
                  would he be forecasting this to
                  the world? He's all but drawn a
                  map and marked an X. What
                  vampires hold sacred is keeping
                  their kind a secret. You never
                  name other immortals, tell where
                  their lairs are. They'd be hunted
                  down.

                                JESSE
                  Right. That's the best part.
                  Lestat's not afraid to piss them
                  off. He wants mortals and
                  immortals to know he's there, to
                  know he exists. I don't know
                  why...
                         (glancing at skeptical
                          Talamascan #1)
                  But this has never happened
                  before. Don't you see? He's a
                  one man revolution.

     All the Talamascans gaze at her a moment.       Jesse holds
     her breath. Has she gotten them back?

                                TALAMASCAN #1
                  And this photo is your evidence?
                  It's hardly conclusive.
                         (snorts)
                  C'mon. It looks like the Blair
                  witch!

     The Talamascans burst out laughing, even Talamascan #2.
     Jesse gazes at them, her face burning red. She's lost
     them, blown it. Made a fool of herself.

     Her frustration rises, she can no longer contain it.       It
     bursts out of her.

                                JESSE
                  Fine. Well then, I guess I'll
                  just have to go back and get
                  better, more conclusive evidence!
                  Maybe you just can't unravel all
                  the mysteries of the world out
                  there, by sitting around all day
                  in a dusty old library in here!

     As they gaze at her, astonished, she gathers her
     materials, starts out. Several start shouting back at
     her. Amidst the uproar, a voice booms across the room.

                                 TALBOT (O.S.)
                  Jesse.

     Everyone turns. Quiets down. DAVID TALBOT stands in the
     back of the room. He's clearly the superior Talamascan,
     though younger than some, very charismatic.

                                 TALBOT
                  My office.   Now.

     He turns, walks out. All the Talamascans look at Jesse.
     It doesn't look good. Her face burning red, Jesse turns,
     leaves.

                                                      CUT TO:


41   EXT. METROPOLITAN BAR (LONDON) - NIGHT (SAME TIME)               41

     A line of hopefuls wanting to enter the exclusive club
     wait for the judgement of two BOUNCERS, one buff, one

                  Okay, you, in. You. No...
                         (smiles at a sexy
                           girl)

                                UNATTRACTIVE GUY
                  C'mon, man, she's waiting for me
                  in there. She said she was
                  putting me on the list. My name's
                  Norman --

                                 BOUNCER #1
                  Yeah, yeah, right. Hey, get a
                  life, alright?
                         (to another sexy
                           girl)
                  You, in.

     Across the street, a figure in the shadows watches.


42   EXT. AROUND CORNER - JUST AFTERWARDS                             42

     Bouncer #1 is now making out with one of the young sexy
     girls he let in, trying to get a hand up her dress.

     A cold WIND suddenly blows, fluttering her skirt.    He
     looks up. A dark figure stands in the shadows.

                                BOUNCER #1
                  Hey, perv, get the hell out of
                  here.

     The figure steps from the shadows.    The Bouncer's face
     turns white.

     It's Lestat...

     The Bouncer starts to back way. The girl starts to
     scream. Lestat clamps his hand over the girl's mouth.
     To the girl...

                                 LESTAT
                  You.   In...

     He gestures to the club. The girl turns and runs for her
     life. As the Bouncer backs away, terrified, Lestat turns
     to him.

                   You.   No.

      Lestat lunges like a phantom -- a flash of teeth -- as
      they FALL FROM FRAME, the distinct sound of BONE
      CRUSHING. Over this scene the BAND'S SONG rushes in.

                                                       CUT TO:

      Lestat enters. Dabs his mouth politely with a white
      handkerchief, the sound of the BAND practicing from
      below.


43    INT. LESTAT'S HOUSE (LONDON) - SOUND STUDIO - JUST AFTER         43

      Lestat and his band rehearse one of their numbers, music
      and voice melding into a grand, almost operatic harmony.


44    INT. CONTROL BOOTH                                               44

      Two SOUND ENGINEERS work the board.

                           SOUND ENGINEER #1
                   When's the concert?

                           SOUND ENGINEER #2
                   Four days.

                   These guys are gonna kill.

      Behind them, Roger sits pensively watching.
      Surreptitiously, he glances down at a book on his lap --
      its title Vampires -- The Occult Truth. He talks on a
      phone.

                                  ROGER
                   Yeah, Phil. We'll need a limo
                   from the airport. I don't know
                   which airfield yet... I don't know
                   the arrival time either.

                  plane... Nope, I'll tell the
                  driver where he's taking us... Hey
                  I don't even know myself... pick
                  up address in London?... Forget
                  it... you'd never find this place.
                  Christ we'll probably have changed
                  houses again by then... What can I

     Shaking his head, Phil glances down at his vampire book.
     Looking back up he see Lestat now staring at him
     intensely while he sings.

     Lestat slides into a high "C" leaning into the
     microphone, catching his own reflection in the booth's
     window, and --

     CRACK -- GLASS SPLINTERS.

     Roger jumps out of his skin, stifling a cry.

                  Two days till we go...

     THROUGH the broken glass we see Roger slump into a chair,
     his nerves totally frayed.

                          ALEX
                  Think we can call that a night.

     Unhooking their instruments, Alex and James start to pack
     up as Maudy slowly approaches Lestat and nuzzles his
     neck.

     He shivers with temptation. Her hand moves down the
     front of his pants. Lestat pulls her into his arms.
     Leaning into her neck he breathes in her scent, closes
     his eyes and... Suddenly opens them right at Roger who
     looks on, extremely perturbed. Smiling like the devil...

                          LESTAT
                  Oh, the sweet song of her blood.

     Roger stares on, terrified.

                          LESTAT
                  I'll hear it in my head all night.

     Gently letting Maudy go...

                             LESTAT
                  Roger...

     He goes directly to Roger, reaches into his open shirt,
     pulls out the crucifix around his neck.

                          LESTAT
                  I didn't know you were religious.

     Roger tries to laugh it off. Lestat sniffs the air. As
     Roger backs away, he turns to open the door, stumbles,
     cutting his hand on a fallen shard of glass. Blood
     trickles from the cut. Roger looks up at Lestat whose
     dark eyes stare intensely at Roger's blood. Roger
     quickly sticks his hand in his mouth. With a horrified
     expression, he realizes he's sucking his blood. He
     quickly heads out. But Lestat is faster and reaches
     into Roger's shirt pocket. Pulls out a clove of garlic.     Lestat
     shakes his head with a smile.

                             LESTAT
                  Roger...

     Roger tries to laugh. Reaches for the garlic to put it
     back in his pocket. But Lestat grabs Roger's hand, blood
     trickling down his wrist. Lestat speaks intensely.

                          LESTAT
                  Be careful, Roger.   Very careful.

     Lestat walks away.    Roger exhales with relief.

                                                       CUT TO:


48   INT. TALBOT'S CHAMBER - SAME TIME                                 48

     A wood-lined room -- walls covered with books, artifacts,
     paintings. Jesse stands before Talbot. He fixes his
     eyes on her, pours her some coffee.

                          TALBOT
                  How's everything? You alright?
                  You sleeping okay?

                  Jesse... you're taking this Lestat
                  stuff pretty seriously... why?

                                JESSE
                  Cause I think I'm on to something
                  pretty big. The most important
                  sighting Talamasca's had in
                  years...
                         (beat, sighs)
                  Jesus, I don't know, David... I
                  thought I was onto something...
                  Maybe I didn't see anything...

     Talbot takes in the dark circles around her eyes, how
     quickly she's emptied her coffee cup. He pours her
     more, smiles gently.

                                 TALBOT
                  You know we work in a really
                  strange field? The supernatural
                  is beguiling at times. It doesn't
                  like to just be observed, it is
                  only satisfied when it has drawn
                  us in completely. I know cause
                  I've felt these things myself.

                  That's what we have to resist, as
                  Talamascans...
                         (as a shadow crosses
                          his face)
                  It's not always easy.

                                JESSE
                         (leaning forward)
                  Talbot. C'mon. You know me. I'm
                  not freaking out on you. I'm just
                  onto what looks -- alright looked

                  -- like a good lead. You're the
                  one who taught me how to do all
                  this. You're the one who taught
                  me to keep pushing and pushing...

     He still looks at her with a penetrating glance.         She
     looks back at him.

                                JESSE
                  David. There's nothing else.
                  Nothing is 'beguiling' me,
                  alright? Nothing. C'mon.

     He gazes at her as she downs her whole coffee,
     registering her strong denial. He smiles at her,
     forcefully changes the mood.

                                 TALBOT
                  Alright.   Just checking...

     Jesse starts out. Looking down at papers on his desk,
     Talbot calls out, almost casually...

                                TALBOT
                  Well, all I can say is you're
                  really lucky you're not lying
                  dead in a gutter with two holes
                  on your neck.

                                JESSE
                  I'd be even luckier if that damn
                  picture came out...
                         (stops in her tracks,
                          turns back, gazes at
                          him, amazed)
                  Wait a second. So you do believe
                  me? You do think it's a vampire
                  coven.

                          sparkling)
                  Yes. But not exactly for the
                  reasons you think. Though your
                  research is top-notch of course...
                         (smiles)
                  Come back here. I'm gonna show
                  you something.

     He goes to the paintings hanging on a wall in the back of
     his office, covered with black velvet. Jesse follows.
     He unveils them.

     They stand before an Eighteenth-Century painting. The
     interior of an enormous Italian villa. There's a man in
     his forties with long white hair, back to us, but his
     face is reflected in a standing mirror.

                          TALBOT
                  What do you see?

                          JESSE
                  They're all nightscapes. The
                  detail is amazing. Mid-1500s.
                  Florence.

                          TALBOT
                  Right. And what do you see in
                  this one?

     Jesse moves to the next painting. Another nightscape, a
     giant medieval tableaux, circa Bruegel.

                          TALBOT
                  And I know it's a Dutch pastoral.

     Jesse runs her finger across the faces, then stops on the
     face of a gentleman with long white hair watching the
     bloodshed of gory battles and the sacrifices of saints
     burned at the stake.

                          JESSE
                  This man is in both.

                           TALBOT
                  Right.   He's in all of them.

     Jesse moves to the next painting, then the next and the
     next, all nightscapes set and painted in the style of
     different eras, all featuring a portrait of the same
     white-maned man.

                          TALBOT
                  Carbon tested? Yes. The
                  different paint samples are all
                  authentic. All painted at the
                  time of that particular style.

     Jesse stops at a contemporary self-portrait.

                          TALBOT
                  It's Marius, Jesse.

                          JESSE
                     (whirling around)
                  Marius?! From Lestat's lyrics.
                  I knew I was right.

                          TALBOT
                  Yes, you were. Good work.

     She smiles at him, victorious.

                                TALBOT
                  I've been personally tracing
                  him for decades. My little
                  obsession. The oldest vampire
                  ever documented. The closest
                  we've come to the original
                  vampire.

                           JESSE
                  What do you mean the original
                  vampire?

     Pointing to a larger depiction of a beautiful woman in
     Egyptian garb --

                          TALBOT
                  There's a Mesopotamian legend that
                  there once was a queen of Egypt,
                  Akasha, long before Tutankhamen or
                  Nefertiti. She was believed to be
                  the original vampire... Marius
                  himself dates back to 400 B.C...

     Jesse gazes at all the paintings, shaking her head in
     wonder, then speaks softly.

                  David, you've been tracking Marius
                  your whole life. Maybe he's out
                  there waiting for you right now.
                         (without looking
                          at him)
                  Don't you ever want to just go and
                  find him and --

     Talbot crosses to her.

                                     TALBOT
                  No. Jesus, we are not talking
                  about having a drink at the
                  Dorchester, Jesse. You know that.
                  Especially with the ancient
                  vampires -- the older they are,
                  the more powerful, the more
                  dangerous...

     He takes her by the arm, smiles down at her.

                          TALBOT
                  Anyway, you don't need to go and
                  stake out some club. Your time is
                  too valuable. I have something
                  far better for you...

                            (surprised)
                  You do?

     He steers her over to a locked cabinet.

                                TALBOT
                  Yes. And I'll tell you something.
                  I've never shown this to anyone.
                  No one else has proved themself
                  in the way you have.

                                JESSE
                         (touched)
                  Thanks. What is it?

     As he unlocks the cabinet...

                                TALBOT
                  Oh you're gonna love this.
                         (glancing at her)
                  Although I'm sure it will keep you
                  up nights to come with nightmares...

     He takes out an old leather-bound journal.    Turns to
     Jesse.

                  Lestat's diary. I found it some
                  years ago. This is where you'll
                  find the answers you need.

     Jesse stares up at him in absolute awe, taking it in.
     Talbot gestures in the direction of the Talamascans in
     the library.

                                TALBOT
                  They don't need to know
                  everything, right?

     She smiles at him.    He gives her the diary.

                                JESSE
                  Thank you for this.

                                TALBOT
                  My pleasure. When I took you on
                  as an apprentice, I knew it was
                  the smartest thing I'd ever done.
                  Now you and I'll meet when you're
                  done... This will be our project...

     As Jesse goes out, holding the journal, Talbot smiles
     after her.

     But after the door closes, his gaze turns again to
     concern. He crosses back to the paintings, pauses a
     moment, staring up into Marius's eyes. Then Talbot
     covers each with the black velvet.

     Jesse sits on the floor, curtains drawn, the room lit
     with candles. A LESTAT SONG plays in the b.g. She
     opens the journal.

                          LESTAT (V.O.)
                  It was the winter of 1788 and I
                  was brought to a Mediterranean
                  Island by the man who made me...

     A lightning flash illuminates a sprawling 18th-Century
     sea-front villa.

                          LESTAT (V.O.)
                  ... if a man is what you'd call

51   INT. VILLA BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     51

     A great round room encircled with candles, their
     reflections flickering in the great glass windows braving
     back the outside STORM. A huge antique bed sits in the
     room's center, and on it... Lestat lays feverish and
     fitful, dressed in a soft linen nightshirt. His neck
     wears a swollen bite. Another flash of lightning
     suddenly jolts him awake. His hands feel the inflamed
     wound as he sees...

     An indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red
     velvet, sitting asleep in a chair across the room. An
     easel stands before him, holding an unseen painting.
     Lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a
     nearby Louis IV chair. He makes for a door when...

     Lestat suddenly stops. He looks back to see the painting
     that stands on the easel. It's a portrait of himself in
     ancient Roman garb, like the god Mars, complete with his
     blond hair and fiery blue eyes. Unable to help himself,
     he approaches the painting, completely fascinated by his
     own image, when suddenly...

     The sleeping man leaps up, grabs   Lestat unmercifully and
     again plunges his teeth into the   young man's neck.
     Lestat fights as best he can but   his strength is no match
     as he's slowly drawn down to the   floor. Finally...

     The strange man lifts himself up from Lestat's neck to
     reveal the face of the vampire MARIUS, the mysterious
     figure. Wiping his blooded mouth on his painter's
     cloth --

                            MARIUS
                  Lestat.    Welcome.

     Weakened and helpless, Lestat drags himself back across
     the floor in terror.

                  Who are you? Do I know you?

                          MARIUS
                  I'm unknowable by nature.

     Marius advances again on the young man...

                          MARIUS
                  But you may call me Marius.

     As Lestat keeps weakly dragging himself away.

                          LESTAT
                  I'm the lord of a great manor.
                  They'll send an army of men to
                  look for me.

                          MARIUS
                  I doubt they'll find you,
                  Lord De Lioncourt. You're a long
                  way from home...

     His strength leaving him, Lestat slumps flat on the
     floor.

                          MARIUS
                  You're weak... near passing. I
                  can barely hear your heartbeat.

                          LESTAT
                  I'll kill you!

     Marius smiles, impressed.

                          MARIUS
                  You really do fear nothing. It is
                  why I chose you. Because you
                  think things are possible which
                  aren't possible...

     Lestat stares at him, his eyes wide.

                          LESTAT
                  Chose me? For what?

                          MARIUS
                  My companion. Someone to share my
                  burden.

     Bending down, he gazes at Lestat.

                          MARIUS
                  You've lost a great deal of blood.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                              35.

                          LESTAT
                     (near tears)
                  I'm dying.

     Suddenly Marius draws a knife from a Roman sheath on his
     belt. With the last of his strength, Lestat grabs his
     attacker's wrist.

                          MARIUS
                  Then drink.

     Guiding Lestat's hand with the knife, Marius smiles and
     cuts his own arm, opening his veins. Lestat stares in
     true terror as Marius lets his blood drip onto Lestat's
     lip. Lestat pulls away as the blood slides into his
     mouth...

                          MARIUS
                  Good, is it not?

     And indeed... it does taste good. That's the new terror
     that's gripping him. He crosses himself and stares up
     into Marius's gentle eyes. Marius bends down, cups
     Lestat's chin.

                          MARIUS
                  Drink and live. You've been brave
                  enough for one night, my son.

     Marius brings his open vein to Lestat's lips. Lestat
     hesitates, but then suddenly... Feeds hungrily as
     Marius's face fills with the bond. He slowly sinks
     down to his knees as Lestat feeds and feeds. As
     Lestat drinks, a barrage of IMAGES flood into him...


52   IMAGES                                                         52

     of Marius's life through the ages... Impressionistic,
     subliminal burst of IMAGES, color... the glory days of
     the Roman Empire to this very moment flash by...


53   BACK TO LESTAT                                                 53

     He keeps drinking from the vampire Marius who gasps with
     the creation of his child.

                          MARIUS
                  Drink... drink and learn.

     Lestat's body grows stronger, his back arching up as he
     draws the "life" into him with full force, as... Marius
     begins to weaken, himself.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                          MARIUS
                  There... there... that will do.

     But Lestat keeps on feeding hungrily.

                          MARIUS
                  No... no more.   Lestat, no more!

     With one great move, Marius pulls Lestat off his arm and
     tosses him across the floor twenty feet away. Marius
     reels back, clamping his open vein with his hand as
     Lestat curls on the ground, gasping ecstatically from the
     rush.

     Slowly, Lestat starts to feel something. Pain begins
     travelling through his body, consuming him until he
     screams. Marius crosses to Lestat convulsing on the
     floor. He kneels and gently wipes his brow. Lestat's
     body thrashes as he grabs at his own limbs...

                          MARIUS
                  Don't be afraid, it's only your
                  body that dies...

     Wiping his brow as he dies...

     Then, Lestat's face still buried in his arms, he begins
     to laugh almost drunkenly. Raising his head, his
     metamorphosis is clear as his face pales and his eyes
     fill with a new kind of power.

                          LESTAT
                  More!

     Lestat smiles with red glistening lips.     A beat on Marius
     as he slowly smiles, too.


54   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                             54

     A million stars...

                          LESTAT (V.O.)
                  I impressed my maker with my
                  thirst for things. He set out to
                  educate me in the unknown. Taught
                  me all about the world, its hidden
                  history... and about myself.

     TILT DOWN to reveal an old fisherman who cries out as
     Lestat bites into his throat. Marius watches as the
     fisherman's body relaxes. He pulls Lestat away.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                            37.

                          MARIUS
                  That's enough, my son... When you
                  feed, you must hold back from the
                  moment of death. You must never
                  take the last drop, or it will
                  draw you in and you will die...

     The fisherman is moaning. Looking down at the suffering
     victim, Marius swiftly snaps his neck and dumps him into
     a boat. He picks up an oar, and with vampire strength,
     drives it like a stake through the bottom of the boat.
     Water starts bubbling in.

                          MARIUS
                  Remember, there is wisdom in the
                  flesh, Lestat. A man wears his
                  history on his skin...

     Marius feels Lestat's gaze, turns to him.

                          MARIUS
                  I'm talking about humanity.

     As Lestat watches the water begin to fill the bottom
     of the boat...

                                     LESTAT
                  Humanity?
                     (snort)
                  We're murderers.

                          MARIUS
                  We're more than that. Their blood
                  that we take into us carries with
                  it life... their life, their
                  knowledge, their complexity.
                  Appreciate your prey, Lestat.

     Marius gazes at the fisherman, then, with vampire
     strength, shoves the boat far out into the ocean.


55   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                           55

     Below the brightest of summer night skies, Lestat and
     Marius walk along, talking intensely. The ocean appears
     to shimmer in the faint light of stars. In the distance,
     several bonfires burn on the sand, dancing figures
     gathered around.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                          LESTAT (V.O.)
                  My senses run amok, like a newborn
                  child. And as for my new powers,
                  I was beside myself with the
                  pleasure of it all...

                          MARIUS
                  The trick is to find the way to
                  face eternity head on. The
                  spirit can be annihilated by
                  boredom just as the body can be
                  destroyed by sun or fire. My
                  solace, my delight, is witnessing
                  the unfolding of human destiny...

     Lestat gazes at Marius's eyes dancing with intellectual
     fervor. As they walk, they pass a group of teenagers,
     just younger than Lestat, at a bonfire, dancing, laughing.

     Lestat gazes over at them as he and Marius pass, hidden
     in shadow.

                          MARIUS
                  ... From Christ to the Dark Ages
                  to the enlightenment, I've never
                  been able to divine what was coming.
                  That's what keeps me going -- I
                  can't wait to see what human
                  beings are going to do next...

     Lestat nods, taking it in. They pass another bonfire.
     MUSIC floats through the night. An OLDER MAN, 50, plays
     balalaika while his daughter, 18, plays violin with great
     passion.

                          MARIUS
                  Who could've predicted the
                  Enlightenment? Or Hannibal and his
                  elephants?

     Marius stops talking, turns. Lestat is no longer beside
     him. Marius turns back and sees Lestat standing in the
     shadows, listening to the music. The young woman, sensing
     something, turns towards Lestat in the shadows as she
     plays. Marius goes to Lestat, pulls him farther into the
     shadows.

                             MARIUS
                  Careful.

                          LESTAT
                  But why must we hide, Marius? We
                  are the powerful, we are the
                  immortal. We should walk fearless
                  in the open!

                          MARIUS
                  Shhh. The life of a vampire is a
                  life of discretion. We must sleep
                  during the day, when we are
                  vulnerable to the sun. Mortals
                  must never know about us. It is
                  forbidden, for the sake of all our
                  kind.

                          LESTAT
                     (gazing at violin
                      player as it sinks in)
                  So I could never know her?

                          MARIUS
                  Not unless you wanted to kill her.

                          LESTAT
                     (beat, quietly,
                      intensely)
                  So I can never be known?

                          MARIUS
                  You're known by me. I granted you
                  that. There are others of our
                  kind... though most are solitary
                  creatures.

     Lestat's eyes fill with some existential realization.

                          LESTAT
                  My God...

                          MARIUS
                  Forget God. You're no longer in
                  his realm. Now we must leave.

     Relenting, Lestat starts to follow. But the music
     quickens. Lestat pauses, turns back. As if the music is
     calling to him.

     The girl still faces into the shadows towards him, and
     plays fast and wild, her fingers flying. Lestat stands
     there frozen to the spot. The music pulses through
     him. He gazes at her fingers, studying their intricate
     movements intensely...

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                              40.

55   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              55

     Impulsively, Lestat goes back to them, hovers, his face
     still somewhat obscured by the darkness. Lestat starts
     clapping along to the music, exuberantly.

     The girl and Father smile, nod to him as they play.
     Marius, in the shadows, is fuming. Lestat's eyes fill
     with the moment, the girl's vitality. He notices that
     sitting on the ground by the girl are several
     instruments. Impulsively, he reaches over, picks up a
     violin. He studies the girl's playing again, then with
     his new powers, as if by osmosis...

     Begins to play with exactly her skill, exactly her
     movements.

     The girl and her Father laugh, delighted with this new
     musician. Lestat plays along with them, joyful,
     exhilarated. The girl's fingers fly. Lestat's fingers
     pick up speed. Faster. Faster. A glittering torrent of
     notes fly out of his violin as if made of gold.

     Unconsciously, Lestat steps closer to the music, into
     firelight. The Father and his daughter become less
     certain, as they gaze at Lestat's strange, pale, glowing
     skin, the luminous shine of eyes. But Lestat is
     completely taken by the music, the moment. The Father
     and the daughter, sensing something strange, stop
     playing. Lestat looks up. Sees terror in their eyes.
     The Father is slowly backing away, pointing in
     horror at Lestat.

                          FATHER
                  Fantasma!! Teras!!

     Lightning fast, out of the shadows, steps Marius. He
     grabs the Father. The girl drops her violin, turns, starts
     running down the beach to a bonfire in the distance.

                          MARIUS
                  Stop her, Lestat!

     Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head no in horror.

                          MARIUS
                  You must!

     Lestat hesitates, then runs after the girl. She turns
     back, sees him getting closer, starts to scream...
     Lestat is suddenly in front of her with his hand over her
     mouth, covering her muffled scream.   Her struggle is no
     use against his strength. Reaching up to her neck, he
     touches it. He looks into her terrified eyes...

                                          CUT TO:

                                                              41.

56   EXT. ISLAND'S SOUTH SHORE - NIGHT                              56

     Marius kneels over the body of the Father on the island's
     deserted shoreline. Tosses him in a boat. Lestat gazes
     at the lifeless body of the girl. Marius turns to
     Lestat, furious.

                       MARIUS
               I will not have you put everything
               at risk! You will mind our laws!

     Picking up Lestat's victim, Marius tosses her into the
     boat as well.

                       MARIUS
               We remain in the shadows.   To do
               otherwise is a road to
               destruction...

     Marius turns to Lestat, who stands in silence, gazing at
     the girl and her Father.

                       MARIUS
                  (quietly)
               I see you still have a few
               lingering mortal emotions. They
               will serve you no good, Lestat.

     Lestat turns to Marius, shaking his head, speaks in a
     horrified whisper...

                       LESTAT
               My God, what have you done to me?

     Lestat turns again toward the bodies of the dead girl and
     her Father, his face filled with pain, enormous sadness.

                             LESTAT
                      (whisper)
               She's just a child... forgive me.


57   EXTREME CLOSEUP - LESTAT                                       57

     closes his eyes.   A violent VIOLIN STRAIN as we PULL BACK
     to see...

     Lestat standing alone in the bedroom, in a deep reverie,
     playing the girl's violin with incredible passion. His
     playing picks up speed as he works himself into a Pagnani
     furor...

                  played for days trying to expel
                  the last bit of my human
                  feelings... and face the cold,
                  dark wasteland of eternity...

     The violin dissolves into Lestat's ROCK MUSIC.


58   BACK TO JESSE (PRESENT)                                        58

     Reading the journal, listening to LESTAT'S MUSIC. She
     hears the lyrics... "Mine eyes dazzle, she died so
     young..." She looks up, her eyes fill with tears, moved
     by Lestat's loneliness. She gazes into the dark night...
     then turns, sees her camera...


59   EXT. STREET (LONDON) - LATER THAT NIGHT                        59

     Jesse moves steadily along the street past darkened
     warehouses. Several bonfires line the lane, illuminating
     rows of prone bodies, cardboard shelters, empty bottles.
     The drunks look up at her with dead eyes.


60   EXT. ALLEY - LATER                                             60

     Jesse goes deeper into a labyrinth of alleys, the street
     becoming darker with every step. In the distance she
     sees the blue light. Figures moving through the fog.
     Jesse moves slowly along a wall in the shadows trying to
     get a better look... Suddenly, out of the shadows, a
     BOTTLE SMASHES... She starts, quickens her pace...

     Runs straight into a bulky figure. A primal scream rises
     from her stomach. The figure is a homeless drunk, more
     scared than she is, who scuttles off quickly into the
     night. Jesse presses her back against the wall.
     Breathes. She inches around the corner...


61   EXT. WAVERLY ARMS - CONTINUOUS ACTION                          61

     ... and from the shadows, gazes at figures knocking on
     the solitary door in the wall up ahead, with the dull
     blue light mounted above. The slot in the door slides
     open. A moment later, the figures vanish inside.

     A moment later, two couples approach, dressed in black.
     Jesse takes a deep breath, then...

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                              43.

61   CONTINUED:                                                     61

     ... falls into step behind them. One knocks on the door.
     A face peers out at the group. Steps back. The door
     opens. Jesse follows the couples in. The door shuts
     behind her.


62   INT. CLUB - NIGHT                                              62

     The music is part blues, part Kurt Weil, part Gothic,
     dark and ominous as if the pianist knew exactly the sort
     of trouble Jesse was in. The bar is comprised of
     elaborately-carved Chinese dragons, a TV mounted
     incongruously in the corner showing a silent Vampire
     Lestat video.

     Couples dance cheek to cheek, rotating like figures on a
     music box. Another couple is necking hot and heavy in
     the corner. Jesse stares at the patrons of this vampire
     coven. Many of the faces are unnaturally pale, gaunt.
     Their eyes shine with a strange, reflective light. Jesse
     moves through the tables, passing a mortal YUPPIE-TYPE
     sitting with a VAMPIRE GIRL he's obviously just met that
     night.

                          YUPPIE
                  Wow. This is the coolest after
                  hours club ever. You sure you
                  don't want a drink?

                          VAMPIRE GIRL
                  Soon.

     The Vampire Girl smiles, glances up at Jesse as she
     passes. Jesse looks away quickly, moves on... The
     pianist watches as she passes by. The couple necking in
     the corner begins to get even more aroused. A mortal
     girl sips on her drink while her lover, a vampire, kisses
     her shoulder, her throat...


63   UNKNOWN POV                                                    63

     Unaware that she is being watched, Jesse continues her
     circuit.


64   BACK TO SCENE                                                  64

     as Jesse approaches the bar where three PUNK VAMPIRES
     slouch, looking up at Lestat on the video.

                                                           44.

65   UNKNOWN POV                                                 65

     We watch the Punk Vampires and hear every word they say
     as the other SOUNDS FADE AWAY.

                       PUNK VAMPIRE #1
               Every coven's going...


66   REVERSE ANGLE                                               66

     REVEAL unknown POV. A vampire, face hidden behind a
     hood, seems extremely interested in what the Punk
     Vampires are saying.


67   BACK TO PUNK VAMPIRES                                       67

     A young girl dressed in Goth gear sits down at the bar.
     Punk Vampire #1 turns and smiles insincerely at her as
     she stares up at Lestat on the TV. Getting a sudden
     chill, the Goth girl takes her drink and moves back into
     the crowd as the vampire looks after her with murderous
     eyes.


68   JESSE                                                       68

     reaches the Punk Vampires. They fall silent as she
     pauses at the bar. She turns, stares at the necking
     couple...


69   JESSE'S POV                                                 69

     ... a brief glimpse of the tiny trickle of blood on the
     mortal girl's neck as she swoons... an even briefer flash
     as her vampire lover comes up for air, his lips and teeth
     shiny with blood...


70   JESSE                                                       70

     stares, horrified.


71   BACK TO SCENE                                               71

                       PUNK VAMPIRE #1 (O.S.)
               Come here often?

     Jesse turns to see Punk Vampire #1 leaning towards her.

                       JESSE
               Sure, all the time.

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                               45.

71   CONTINUED:                                                      71

     The Punk Vampire pulls down her collar.

                          PUNK VAMPIRE #1
                  Don't see any marks.

                          JESSE
                  You haven't seen the rest of my
                  body.

                          PUNK VAMPIRE #2
                  Is that an invitation?

     Jesse finds herself surrounded by the three Vampires.
     She shakes her head, too frightened to get out a
     response.

                          PUNK VAMPIRE #3
                  So, where's your host?

                          JESSE
                  My host... oh he's here somewhere.

     She peers into the darkness, starts moving towards the
     door...

     Finds herself blocked by Punk Vampire #2.

                          PUNK VAMPIRE #2
                  Your host. What's his name?

     Jesse looks around, trying not to panic. Pale faces,
     pale eyes stare at her. A long, terrible pause...
     Suddenly --

                          JESSE
                  Marius...


72   HOODED FIGURE                                                   72

     leans forward, surprised, studies this strange mortal,
     fascinated.


73   BACK TO SCENE                                                   73

                           PUNK VAMPIRE #1
                  Sorry.   Don't know the guy.

     The Punk Vampires laugh.     Jesse desperately tries to
     cover her terror.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                          46.

73   CONTINUED:                                                 73

                          JESSE
                  Marius has the blood of the
                  ancients flowing in his veins.

                          PUNK VAMPIRE #2
                  There aren't any ancients left.
                  They all turned to dust...

                          JESSE
                  That's a myth. Marius is around
                  here somewhere...

     Jesse again heads for the door. But Punk Vampire #1 has
     appeared in front of her. She stares at him, terrified.

                          JESSE
                  You... you really should meet him.

                          PUNK VAMPIRE #1
                  And why is that?

     Jesse watches the other Punk Vampires slowly begin to
     close in on her. As she speaks, she slowly edges to the
     door...

                          JESSE
                  Because... because... he's wise, a
                  philosopher... he asks the big
                  questions. Like how are you going
                  to get through eternity? It's
                  easier for us mortals. Life is
                  brief, but for you...

     She inches toward the door, desperately stalling. Their
     white faces gleam menacingly as they close in. She
     struggles to get the words out...

                          JESSE
                  I mean... what can you really do
                  with immortality besides just slip
                  from one day to the next, trapped
                  in a void of meaninglessness,
                  relieved only by your next victim?
                  How do you not give in to despair
                  and just wither away from boredom,
                  hopelessness?

     The Punk Vampires pause, staring at her, as her words
     sink in. The hooded figure leans forward revealing his
     face...

     It is Lestat. He stares at Jesse, amazed. Jesse glances
     desperately at the door. It's just a few feet away now.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                             47.

73   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             73

                          JESSE
                  You know, it's like they say --
                  the more things change, the more
                  they stay the same. For you
                  that's forever, right?

     All around her, vampires are turning to look. The Punk
     Vampires stare at her, eyes narrowing. Jesse is now
     inches from the door. She can barely breathe. Punk
     Vampire #1 gazes at her, his confusion suddenly turning
     to anger.

                          PUNK VAMPIRE #1
                  You know, you're really a
                  downer...

     He bares his fangs. Jesse bolts out the door... PAN
     ACROSS vampire faces staring after Jesse TO Lestat
     who gazes at her, absolutely entranced. He watches the
     Punk Vampires head after Jesse.

                                               CUT TO:


74   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                            74

     Jesse hurries up the alley. Breaks into a run. But the
     three Punk Vampires from the bar have somehow gotten
     outside. They land in front of her, beside her, behind
     her. Heart racing, she shakes with fear. They close in,
     smiling.

                          PUNK VAMPIRE #3
                  Now this isn't gonna hurt.    You
                  might even enjoy it...

     He runs his hand up and down her body. Jesse starts to
     shake. She breaks out in a cold sweat. The others grin.
     He picks her up by the throat. Her legs flail in the
     air...

     Suddenly, the two vampires turn and hiss like cats. Jesse
     hits the flagstones hard with a grunt. She gasps for
     air, looks up as the vampires are hurled out of the alley
     by an invisible force. Jesse alone, turns, still woozy.
     Finds herself staring at...

     Lestat...

     Jesse's eyes open wide, entirely stunned.

     He drinks her in with his eyes, marking the soft paleness
     of her skin, her long, red hair, the flush on her cheeks,
     her pulsing jugular.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                             48.

74   CONTINUED:                                                    74

     Jesse stares into his entrancing grey eyes, tries to
     gather herself together, half fearful, half titillated.
     They gaze at each other, the air suddenly electric.

                          JESSE
                  You saved me.

                                LESTAT
                  Perhaps... So you know Marius...

     Jesse notices her rucksack cast aside by the Punk
     Vampires -- Lestat's journal sticks out. She glances at
     Lestat. He mustn't see it. She steps away, tries to
     distract him.

                          JESSE
                  I know a lot of things.

     He gazes at her. Moves closer, breathing her in, making
     her flustered. He smiles.

                          LESTAT
                  Not how to stay alive apparently.

                          JESSE
                  Well I guess we've got that in
                  common. Although I think I'm a
                  little ahead in the race here.

                          LESTAT
                         (a beat, surprised
                          at her brazenness)
                  Well, I can fix that.

     He circles her. Jesse is shaking, terrified. Enjoying
     the game, Lestat smiles, moves closer. But Jesse suddenly
     blurts out.

                          JESSE
                  'Mine eyes dazzle, she died so
                  young.' It's about the girl with
                  the violin, isn't it?

     That stops Lestat. He gazes at Jesse, surprised.
     Recovers his composure. Stares at her intensely,
     regarding her anew.

                               LESTAT
                  Is it? And what else do you think
                  you know?

                                JESSE
                         (desperate,
                          stalling)
                  I... I think you're a lot like
                  Marius, Lestat.

                                 LESTAT
                          (staring into her
                           eyes, probing)
                  Am I?   Tell me all about it.

                                JESSE
                  You're... you're both artists.   He's
                  a painter. You're a singer...

     As she speaks, Lestat guides Jesse over to a pile of
     crates. She stares at some beer bottles shattered on
     the top of one. He guides her hand downward, closer to
     the shattered glass.

                                 LESTAT
                  Is that so?   What I do is art, is
                  it?

                                JESSE
                  Yes... From nothing... you try to
                  create... something beautiful...
                         (shaking now as her
                          hand gets closer
                          and closer)
                  ... out of the... the cold, dark
                  wasteland of eternity...

     He stares at her, the words oddly familiar, then scrapes
     her finger along the bits of broken glass, gravel. She
     gasps with pain...

     Lestat gazes at the drops of blood that appear,
     glistening on Jesse's finger...

                                LESTAT
                         (softly)
                  Something beautiful...

                  But... but Marius isn't a rebel.
                  You're different in that way. You
                  don't want to hide, follow the
                  laws, concealed in the shadows
                  like some insect. You... you
                  still want to walk with the
                  living, don't you, Lestat?

                                                                   50.

     He stares into her eyes, slowly brings her bleeding
     finger toward his mouth.

                                LESTAT
                  Well, I'm not hiding now, am I?

     As her bleeding thumb gets closer and closer to his
     mouth...

                                JESSE
                  No, but the only time you're not
                  really alone is when you kill...
                  But, Lestat, you can't help it...
                  it's not your fault... He made
                  you this way...

                                  LESTAT
                           (with her blood on
                            his lips, shakes
                            his head)
                  Ah.    Poor, poor me...

     As he brings her finger closer and closer to his mouth.

     Their eyes bore into each other, he stares at her rosy
     cheeks, the cold sweat on her forehead, taking in her
     remarkable, if foolhardy daring. Her eyes gazing
     straight into his...

     He brings her bleeding finger into his mouth.       She may
     swoon.

     Lestat's eyes burn as he tastes her for mortality, her
     fragility a brief second, listening to her blood.
     there's something there that surprises him as he gazes
     at this mortal girl. He feels something. Desire...

     Then her blood speaks to him as Lestat's eyes fall on her
     rucksack. He sees the journal. It all falls into place.

     Lestat's lip curls in anger. He shoves Jesse away.
     Wipes his mouth. The mood suddenly changes.

                                LESTAT
                  Well, Talamascan, you're certainly
                  a very clever librarian, aren't
                  you?

     She stares at him, found out. He turns from her,
     laughing, but not the kind of laugh to make Jesse
     think all's well.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                LESTAT
                         (shaking his head)
                  How sad, you people always trying
                  to know the unknowable... So, was
                  it a good read? My diary.

     Jesse slowly nods, admitting to all.    He shakes his head.

                                LESTAT
                  Talamasca's been following me for
                  years. I've never known one to be
                  so brave. Or is it just foolish?

                                JESSE
                  I... I'm only an apprentice.

     He waves her off, dismissive.

                                LESTAT
                  Go. I'm through with you. Your
                  kind never satisfies my thirst.

     He turns, walks away. Jesse lets out a sigh of relief,
     then stares after him. She hesitates, then suddenly
     calls out:

                                JESSE
                  Does anything, Lestat?

     A pause in his gait. But he keeps walking away.       Jesse
     hesitates again, but still calls out.

                                JESSE
                  I mean, what's the point of coming
                  into the light if not to have
                  someone really know you?

     But he keeps going.    She takes one last chance --

                                JESSE
                  You want the world to see you're
                  real, don't you, Lestat? Don't
                  you? Well, here I am!

     Suddenly Lestat spins. Stares at the fragile mortal girl
     risking everything. Flash. Jesse gasps.

     He now stands right before her. He grabs her, pulls her
     to him close, tight, hard. He could just snap her neck
     and be done with it.

                                LESTAT
                  You better just stick to your
                  books, Talamascan. 'Cause you
                  have it all wrong. I love all
                  this. I delight in it. The
                  dark, dreary world I went to
                  sleep in has burnt itself out and
                  been replaced by the 20th Century
                  -- can you imagine my joy at
                  waking up to discover such a
                  world? It has outdistanced my
                  wildest dreams of it. I scream of
                  good and evil, and mortals stand
                  and cheer. I adore being back in
                  action... every moment, every
                  single drop of it! Now consider
                  yourself exceedingly lucky and go!

     He pushes her away.       She gasps, humbled by his physical
     power.

     She retrieves her rucksack. Starts away. As she
     reaches the end of the alley, she pauses, takes a breath,
     turns back, daring everything.

                                   JESSE
                  Lestat!

     He turns back, stares at her, astonished.

                                JESSE
                  There's something you left out of
                  your diary.

                                   LESTAT
                            (amazed)
                  What?

                                JESSE
                         (stares right into
                          his eyes)
                  You kept her violin, didn't you?

     A beat, then Lestat shakes his head, laughs at the
     absurdity of what she's saying. But Jesse is undaunted.

                                JESSE
                  Hey, it's okay. I understand...
                         (softly)
                  After all, it's only human.

     That stops him. Their eyes bore into each other again.
     Electric. Then Lestat hisses at her, the inhuman sound
     filling the alley. Lestat lunges, fangs bared. Jesse
     screams. Turns. Runs. Finds herself --


     EXT. BUSY STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     In the midst of traffic on a busy street.     People walking
     by.

                                  JESSE
                  Jesus Christ.

     She stands there a moment, happy, amazed to be alive.
     Then it sinks in. She realizes -- Lestat let her go.

     She glances back at the alley, but Lestat is gone.

     She brings her finger to her mouth, slowly sticks it in,
     tastes her own blood, shivers with fear -- and something
     else -- desire.

     What she doesn't see is...

     Lestat in the shadows, silently watching her. He gazes
     at her youth, her bright eyes, her daring, her mortal
     passion. She has affected him.

     He watches as she turns and runs away.

     through the lavish palace.

                                GROUPIE #2
                  I heard that Lestat keeps all
                  these girls in all his wine
                  cellars, and it's really nice,
                  and they give you food and
                  cable and weed.

                          GROUPIE #1
                  Oh, please...

                           GROUPIE #2
                  That's what I heard. But you have
                  to let him suck you on your neck
                  whenever he wants. Doesn't sound
                  too bad.

                  remember that cute guy's name at
                  the Kid Rock concert? The one
                  behind the bathroom.

                                GROUPIE #1
                  Oh yeah. Let me think... his
                  first name was Blow. And his
                  second name was Me, I think.

     They crack up.


76   INT. LESTAT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                76

     Lestat enters the bedroom. Behind him, Lestat's dressing
     room stretches off into the distance, rows of beautiful
     suits made from the finest wools and silks. The
     gradation of colors is spectacular. Peering out at the
     near-dawn light, a look of loneliness clouds his face.

     He crosses to the closet. Opens a panel to reveal a
     safe. Stares at it a moment. Punches in the code. It
     swings open to reveal something wrapped carefully in
     black velvet. Lestat unwraps it delicately. It's the
     ancient violin.

                          LESTAT
                     (softly)
                  Clever, clever librarian.

     He quickly puts the violin back, closes the safe door.
     He shakes his head, tries to laugh it off. But a shadow
     remains on his face. Lestat hears a gasp. Turns. Roger
     has just entered.

                          ROGER
                  I didn't see you come in.

                          LESTAT
                  No, Roger, you wouldn't have.

                                ROGER
                  So this house is fine I assume.
                  To your liking?

                                 LESTAT
                  Yes.   For the moment.

                  you think?

                                 LESTAT
                  Well... I wouldn't unpack if I
                  were you.

                         (sighs)
                  Right... the... girls you asked
                  for. They're in the guest wing.

                           LESTAT
                  Ah.   Yes.

     Lestat gazes at the door, pensive.

                          ROGER
                  Do you want me to take them home
                  later?

     Lestat smiles at the clumsy attempt to protect the girls.

                          LESTAT
                  No, thank you, Roger. I'll make
                  sure they're taken care of.

     Roger nods, trying to hide his nervousness.      Lestat
     smiles...


77   INT. LESTAT'S GUEST WING - SOON AFTER                           77

     CAMERA MOVES OUT INTO the lavish room TOWARD the two
     girls who are now dreamy, floating with the effect of the
     joint they are smoking. REVEAL Lestat as he approaches
     the girls. Looking up, they smile childishly at their
     host, then fall about laughing.

                          LESTAT
                  I don't think we've met.

                             GROUPIE #1
                  Want me?

     Circling the couches, he just smiles.

                          GROUPIE #1
                  You hungry?

                          LESTAT
                  I'm always hungry.

                          GROUPIE #1
                  We've got the munchies?    You got
                  any food?

                  Vampires don't eat... food.

     The girls laugh nervously.       Lestat laughs dangerously...

                                GROUPIE #1
                  You hungry for something else?

     She opens her legs provocatively. Pacing across the
     room, he stands before the girls. He curls his finger
     around the first groupie's hair when a shadow crosses
     his face.

                          LESTAT
                  Mine eyes dazzle, she died so
                  young.

                             GROUPIE #1
                  Huh?

                          LESTAT
                  It's a very old poem of mine.

     Losing enthusiasm, Lestat walks away and drops himself
     onto a couch. With a clap of his hands, the TV switches
     ON. He silently watches one of his video clips.

     The girls glance at each other, then, giggling, crawl
     over toward Lestat. Groupie #1 slides her hand slowly
     up his leg.

                  C'mon, don't you want to have
                  some fun?

     She reaches for his belt. But he recoils at the touch
     and slides off the couch onto the floor with grace.

                          LESTAT
                  Don't do that.

                          GROUPIE #1
                     (giggling)
                  Are you ticklish?

                          LESTAT
                     (deadpan)
                  I'm very ticklish.

     The Second Groupie giggles as well...

                                GROUPIE #2
                  Hey, you ever been tickled by four
                  hands at once? Hey, can you take
                  both us, Lestat? What'd'ya think?

     And at once they both start after Lestat on all fours
     to tickle him. He gazes at them, torn, then laughs at the
     sight and gets down on...

     All fours as well as he leads them around the room in a
     childish game.

                                   LESTAT
                  I don't know.     Let's see.

     They try to tickle him but he stays just a few feet ahead of
     them the whole time. The girls giggle as they pursue...

     Lestat crawling just   ahead of them across the floor
     and... Up the wall.    The teenagers keep giggling as they
     watch him ascend the   wall like a spider. They can't
     believe what they're   seeing as...

     Lestat reaches the wall's top and now crawls upside-down
     across the ceiling. The girls begin to giggle and half-cry...
     as they arch their necks all the way back to see...
     Lestat crawling down the opposite wall. The girls sit
     open-mouthed with terror as Lestat reaches the ground --

     He heads straight for them.

     The girls begin to scream... SCREAMS CONTINUE OVER...

     BLACKNESS.

                                                              58.

78   INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME                                      78

     CLOSE ON Jesse, her face bright, walking quietly, talking
     intensely on a cell phone.

                       JESSE
               You're right, David. The journal
               has everything in it.

                       TALBOT (V.O.)
               I knew you'd appreciate its
               scientific significance.

                        JESSE
               David, listen...
                  (struggles a moment)
               I'm going to Los Angeles for the
               concert.

                        TALBOT (V.O.)
               What?   You are not! I forbid it.

                       JESSE
               David, I... I talked to him...
               Look I'm sorry. But I... I have
               to see what's out there with my
               own eyes. I'm onto something. I
               just don't know what yet... I have
               to find out...


79   INT. STUDY - ON TALBOT                                         79

     Holding the phone, stunned.   He leans forward, speaks
     intensely, his face grave.

                       TALBOT
               Jesse, you listen to me very, very
               carefully now. You are no longer
               seeing things clearly. Your
               emotions are clouding things.


80   BACK TO JESSE                                                  80

                       JESSE
               It's not emotion. It's
               instinct... I'll return when I
               have my findings. Good-bye.

                       TALBOT (V.O.)
                  (angry)
               Jesse, wait!

     She hangs up. Can't quite believe what she's doing.
     REVEAL Jesse is heading for a boarding gate at Heathrow
     airport. She hands over the ticket, boards the plane.

                                                              59.

     in his inner sanctum. He looks at all the paintings.
     His neat, protected world. It's as if Marius is taunting
     him. He slams his fist down in fury. Stares at the
     rising dust.


82   INT. PLANE - NIGHT                                             82

     Jesse puts on headphones, listens to LESTAT'S MUSIC.   As
     she opens the journal, LESTAT'S MUSIC DISSOLVES INTO
     VIOLIN...


83   FLASHBACK - INT. VILLA - BEDROOM - LESTAT                      83

     Lestat standing alone in the bedroom in a deep reverie,
     playing the violin, with incredible passion.

     His playing picks up speed, the bow bending across the
     strings with a maestro's speed and precision.

                             LESTAT (V.O.)
               Yes, Marius was impressed with my
               thirst for knowledge... But it

               turned out that there was such a
               thing as knowing too much. There
               were things Marius was not yet
               ready to teach me... and Marius
               and I parted ways.

     Suddenly, the bow flies out of his hand and slides across
     the floor, jamming itself under an old bookcase. Lestat
     comes out of his spell, walks across the room to the
     bookcase, bends down to cleave the bow out from under it.
     Having difficulty, he pushes back an old rug on the floor
     when he sees something...

     Carved into one of the floorboards is an Egyptian eye
     with a hole dug out of its iris. Stepping aside, he
     realizes he is standing on a manhole. A beat ON Lestat
     as he thinks... Poking his finger through the hole of the
     Egyptian eye, he lifts the manhole to reveal a steep set
     of steps leading down into the villa's basement.

                          LESTAT
               Marius!

     No answer. Lestat looks around wondering what to do.
     Taking a candelabra off the table, he ventures down the
     stairs, peering down into the darkness.

                                                             60.

84   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - SECRET STAIRCASE - NIGHT                84

     Lestat negotiates a circling flight of stone steps,
     winding its way into the lowest bowels of the villa,
     still carrying his violin.


85   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY                  85

     Lestat finds himself facing a steeply descending
     passageway that stretches into darkness. He tests the
     stones ahead of him with caution...

     Suddenly, the sconces along the passageway come to
     life... In quick succession, they flare up and burn with
     an unnatural intensity. Lestat, struck with curiosity
     and wonder, puts down his candelabra and ventures forth.
     We FOLLOW Lestat as he rounds the corner and stops.
     There is an open foyer area leading to two great wooden
     doors, held firm by a tree-sized carved wooden bolt that
     bars the doors shut from the outside.

     Suddenly, the BOLT flies up and SPLINTERS with a
     SHRIEKING CRACK. The doors fly open revealing a bright
     light from within... Lestat, apprehensive, continues
     towards the open doorway.


86   INT. SANCTUARY - CONTINUOUS ACTION                            86

     Lestat enters, squinting through the bright light from
     scores of burning sconces. At the far end of the
     sanctuary Lestat makes out the shape of two statues,
     an Egyptian man and an Egyptian woman sitting stone
     still, seemingly staring straight at him, AKASHA and
     her King, ENKIL. We recognize Akasha from the sketches
     in Talbot's office. Stepping closer, they appear not to
     be statues at all but rather alabaster humans with the
     palest skin imaginable. His eyes widen at the sight of
     their clothes -- the most valuable Egyptian finery;
     bracelets of gold, headdresses of incredible gems,
     clothes of silk. Staring up into their faces, Lestat
     is struck with the realization...

                       LESTAT
               They're... alive.

     Lestat is drawn to the woman -- her form and beauty is
     exquisite even in its absolute stillness. As if this
     statue had just asked him to play, Lestat holds out his
     violin.

                       LESTAT
               Would you like me to play for you?

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                            61.

86   CONTINUED:                                                   86

     Her eyes still bore into him. Lestat smiles.   He raises
     his violin and begins to play.

     The song of the VIOLIN ECHOES around the walls...

     Lestat plays, with increasing abandon...

     Akasha and Enkil sit frozen...

     Lestat plays and plays, lost in the music.   He throws a
     glance up at the throne and stops...

     Akasha is moving...

     Slowly, her eyelids pull back to reveal pale green eyes.

     Lestat stares in amazement... Her arm rises up, her wrist
      extended outward towards Lestat. The pulse of a
     HEARTBEAT begins... Lestat moves toward her as if
     beckoned. A green vein appears beneath the marble
     surface of her skin. The vein pulses as the blood
     courses around. The HEARTBEAT POUNDS LOUDER, DEEPER.

     The sound fills Lestat's head as he is drawn closer to
     Akasha's wrist. Lowering himself, as if genuflecting,
     Lestat bends closer to the vein which looks like the very
     font of life to him...


87   EXT. VILLA ROOF - NIGHT (SAME TIME)                          87

     Marius sits under the stars, painting, when his hand
     begins to tremble... Suddenly, he drops his brush,
     startled by some unexpected feeling that passes through
     him. He stands bolt upright as a frightening GUST of
     WIND sweeps across him.


88   BACK TO SANCTUARY                                            88

     Lestat sinks his teeth into Akasha's vein, drawing in the
     unimaginable font. A burst of image and color floods
     into him, as...


89   LESTAT'S IMAGES                                              89

     of Ancient Egypt... power... supremacy... slavery... all
     impressionistic, subliminal... the bright burning sun, red
     lips, blood spurting like a fountain...

     END OF IMAGES.

90   MARIUS                                                      90

     in the sanctuary, hovering over Lestat, who lays on the
     stone floor in a catatonic state, staring. Marius looks
     down upon him, the sconces above blazing high with
     flames. Marius's VOICE ECHOING furiously...

                       MARIUS
               What have you done, Lestat?
               Lestat!


91   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - NIGHT                                 91

     Lestat lays in bed, feverish, his skin paler than ever.
     At the foot of the bed stands Marius.

                       MARIUS
                  (quietly)
               Lestat?

     The young vampire's eyes bulge open in the grip of some
     incredible sensation, smiling the most wicked of smiles.
     Lestat's chest heaves upward, pulling his body with it,
     only to be jerked back by the manacles that hold him to
     the bed.

                       LESTAT
               More!

                       MARIUS
               I don't think so, my little lord.

     Lestat writhes with a physical delight that is almost
     painful. Lestat realizes he is shackled to the bed with
     manacles and chains. Struggles against them.

                       LESTAT
               Let me go!

                       MARIUS
               No. You've drunk the purest
               blood. Seen the oldest of things
               -- far too much for one as young
               as you. You've been unconscious
               for days.

                       LESTAT
               God, her blood is like liquid
               fire.
                  (squirms)
               Who are they?

                          MARIUS
                  She... she is your mother, my
                  mother... Akasha, the Queen of all
                  who are damned. And he is her
                  King.

                          LESTAT
                  Release me!

     Lestat struggles with all his might. One of his manacles
     splits, releasing a leg. Marius stares, surprised.

                          MARIUS
                  She made you quite powerful.
                     (withdrawing a saber
                      from its sheath)
                  Don't make me use this!

     Lestat still struggles.       The manacles strain.

                          LESTAT
                  Marius, please, just one more
                  time. I felt the sun. The light,
                  Marius, the light!

     Suddenly pressing the knife to Lestat's throat --

                          MARIUS
                  Lestat, listen to me! I have
                  watched over Akasha and her King
                  for 2000 years! They must never
                  awaken!

     Lestat stares up at him.

                          MARIUS
                  Akasha and her King nearly drank
                  this earth dry when they ruled
                  over Egypt. They drank until
                  they lost their will to drink.
                  They became living statues. And
                  yet Akasha still sustains the
                  life force of all vampires. It
                  is believed what happens to her,
                  happens to all of us.

     Lestat gazes up at him, taking it in.       Marius moves
     slowly away.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                                64.

                          MARIUS
                  If she were ever to rise, she
                  would again desiccate the earth!
                  She has no respect for anything
                  except the taste of blood.
                  Immortal and human alike...

     Lestat roars and struggles against his manacles.

                          LESTAT
                  You'll not stop me...

     Marius stares at him, shocked.

                          MARIUS
                  I hear her blood in your voice...
                  In all the years I've cared for
                  them, not once have they moved...

                          LESTAT
                  Until tonight. And she chose me!
                  Me! Never you! You'll not stop
                  me!

     Marius moves at super-speed, grabs Lestat by the neck,
     and pins him down.

                          MARIUS
                  You are part of a great coven!
                  You take responsibility for your
                  kind!

                          LESTAT
                     (snarls)
                  I must have more!

     Lestat, lost, looks at Marius, his eyes intoxicated with
     Akasha's blood. Marius steps back. Looks at his
     fledgling with great sadness, anger, disappointment.

                          MARIUS
                  I chose you for your bravery, but
                  I was wrong. You know only
                  selfishness. I can no longer trust
                  you... It gives me no pleasure to
                  look upon what I have created.

     Marius turns his back on Lestat.     Lestat stares after
     him.

                                                              65.

92   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - NEXT DAY                                 92

     THROUGH the balcony we see the last warm colors of the
     sunset vanish into the blue of night. Lestat awakens,
     his manacles removed. He stretches, shakes his head, as
     if clearing his head, but something causes him to stop...
     Something has changed. Marius's paints have gone. Some
     of his paintings remain, but his easel and paint boxes
     are removed, leaving splattered outlines on the faded
     marble floor.

                         LESTAT
               Marius!

     No response.


93   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - SECRET STAIRCASE                         93

     Lestat runs down the staircase, which is dark except for
     the candelabra in his hand.


94   INT. MARIUS'S VILLA - UNDERGROUND SANCTUARY                    94

     Lestat throws open the doors and enters to find... Akasha
     and Enkil have been taken, as have the thrones and most
     of the royal paraphernalia.

                         LESTAT
               Marius!    Please!


95   EXT. MARIUS'S VILLA/BEACH - NIGHT                              95

     Lestat runs down the beach, the sand showing no
     footprints.

                       LESTAT (V.O.)
               Many times since, I have called to
               Marius. I howled into the night
               in loneliness and pain.

     Lestat screams into the darkness, filled with despair,
     grief. He disappears off into the night.

                       LESTAT (V.O.)
               But there was no answer -- just
               the endless procession of days,
               months, years... My teacher left
               me to my darkest lesson -- that in
               the end, we are alone.

     Lestat looks up from feeding on a mortal. Wipes the
     blood from his mouth, gazes into the dark night.

                                                               66.

96    INT. PLANE - NIGHT (PRESENT)                                   96

      Jesse closes the journal, her eyes wide with the new
      knowledge of Lestat's past. She sits there a moment,
      speechless, then stares out at the vast, black night.

      TILT DOWN TO:


97    EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT                      97

      SUPERIMPOSE:    LOS ANGELES

      PAN DOWN to Lestat standing on the edge of a very high
      fence high above the sparkling lights of downtown,
      gazing into the dark night. The fence encircles his
      Hollywood Hills home, a high-tech modern version of a
      medieval fortress of steel and glass, hidden deep in
      the canyon, his only neighbors, chaparral and coyotes.

      Lestat closes his eyes as if listening to something. As
      we PULL BACK again, and RISE UP INTO the sky, a LESTAT
      SONG begins to play and magically we are in the MUSIC
      and with a visual splash we are... MOVING SWIFTLY ACROSS
      the globe with the MUSIC -- as we CUT ACROSS the world
      INTO the west and INTO... The night fallen over Asia
      where we soon find ourselves in...


98    ASIAN FACTORY                                                  98

      where LESTAT'S MUSIC plays for the evening       shift over a
      sweatshop BOOM BOX.


99    INDIAN MARKETPLACE                                             99

      where LESTAT'S MUSIC plays from SPEAKERS in a shop
      window. We TRAVEL WESTWARD TO...


100   ANCIENT GRAVEYARD                                              100

      where the... Ground splits open before our very eyes.
      From out of the dirt, a beautiful teenage boy stands
      naked...


101   VAMPIRE ARMAND                                                 101

      He pulls the pieces of a worm-eaten coffin from his
      person, as the MUSIC travels further to...


102   MASSIVE ANCIENT STONES                                         102

      parting as another resurrected figure rises from the
      darkness and reveals itself to be...

                                                            67.

103   VAMPIRE PANDORA                                              103

      With one self-assured twist of her head, she shakes the
      red dust from her hair to reveal long curling black
      tresses falling down over her dark-skinned shoulders.
      The MUSIC travels further to...


104   PORTABLE RADIO                                               104

      held by a camel driver camping out in the Sahara Desert.
      His CAMEL BRAYS fearfully... The camel driver stares
      before him, drop-jawed and terrified, and we now see what
      he sees...


105   CAMEL DRIVER'S POV                                           105

      A corner stone of a desert sarcophagus begins to move, as
      a figure in tattered rags emerges from the sarcophagus and
      unbandages his face and neck, shakes the sand from his
      hair and eyes to reveal a skeletal form with white
      leathery skin bulging with strange blue veins...


106   BACK TO SCENE                                                106

      The VAMPIRE KHAYMAN offers the driver a polite smile.
      The driver faints back into the sand as the camels bolt
      off. And still LESTAT'S MUSIC plays as we finally END UP
      AT...


107   SANCTUARY OF AKASHA AND ENKIL                                107

      An OVER the SHOULDER SHOT of Enkil sitting motionless in
      his throne, not resurrecting at all. Akasha and her
      throne remain O.S. We MOVE CLOSER to reveal... Enkil's
      throat gapes, torn open, and whereas before his skin
      was pale, it's now a chalkish powder. And next to him...
      Akasha's throne sits empty. A god again walks the earth.
      A GUST of WIND suddenly blows and Enkil crumbles into
      white dust.


108   INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT                                        108

      A tall, shapely female flight attendant sways down the
      first-class aisle of an airplane, her back TO us. She
      stops by a seat where Jesse sleeps uncomfortably. Pulling
      out a blanket, the attendant drapes it over Jesse, tucking
      it closely around her neck, then, curiously, the stewardess
      leans down.

                                                            68.

109   CLOSE ON LIPS                                                109

      begins to sensually kiss Jesse's neck. We begin to hear
      the BEATING of a HEART, getting LOUDER...

      The lips part to expose fangs slowly sinking themselves
      into Jesse's skin. She murmurs in her sleep...

                             JESSE
                   Lestat.


110   WIDER                                                        110

      She stirs awake to see -- the face of Akasha, her green
      eyes flashing bright.

                                             CUT TO:


111   JESSE                                                        111

      wakes with a start.

                             JESSE
                   Akasha!

      Jesse looks up to see the real ATTENDANT is standing next
      to her.

                           ATTENDANT
                   We've started our approach into
                   L.A. You should fasten your seat
                   belt.

      Jesse nods and quickly fastens her belt, pulls it tight.


112   INT. LESTAT'S HOUSE (LOS ANGELES) - NIGHT                    112

      Lestat suddenly glides through an open door and calmly
      touches ground. He empties his pockets out on a coffee
      table. We see a --


113   CLOSEUP - BOX OF MATCHES                                     113

      "Sky Bar."


114   BACK TO SCENE                                                114

      Dabbing his mouth with a handkerchief, Lestat tosses it on
      top of the matches to reveal fresh bloodstains on the
      cloth... a look of loneliness clouds his face.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                              69.

114   CONTINUED:                                                    114

                           LESTAT
                   I hate bedtime.

      He turns, enters his bedroom, closing the door behind him.


115   INT. LESTAT'S MANSION - STRANGE POV - EVENING                 115

      We find ourselves in the strange blue-grey world of a
      VAMPIRE'S POV, walking THROUGH Lestat's mansion. PAST
      his band, James, Alex and Maudy, laying in the studio in
      a hazy sleep from yet another night of debauchery.

      We MOVE menacingly INTO... Lestat's expensive living
      quarters, PAST the huge glassed-in space and into
      Lestat's private hall, leading to his bedroom door. We
      ENTER easily, PASSING the enormous bed, and CONTINUE
      THROUGH INTO a smaller, darker chamber... OVER TO
      Lestat's coffin, stealthily APPROACHING his "sleeping"
      figure laying closed-eyed and almost peaceful-looking,
      when...


116   LESTAT                                                        116

      bolts up   and looks around the room to see... nobody.
      Lestat's   instincts are as alive as they could ever be as
      he scans   the room with all his powers, and to his utter
      surprise   finally sees...


117   WIDER                                                         117

      A painting leans against a wall, turned front-side-over.
      Lestat gets out of his coffin and goes over to the
      painting with trepidation. He turns it over and then
      smiles to himself. It is a portrait of Lestat as a
      rocker. The hand and style are unmistakable.

                           LESTAT
                      (whisper)
                   Marius...!


118   INT. LESTAT'S MANSION - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION       118

      Lestat bursts out the doors of his bedroom and looks down
      into the living room. Marius sits on a couch, still
      dressed in red velvet, studying the Rolling Stone with
      Lestat on the cover.

                             MARIUS
                   Lestat.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                           70.

118   CONTINUED:                                                 118

      Marius looks up. The two vampires regard each other for
      a long moment. Lestat is overcome with conflicting
      emotions. Guarded smiles rise to their faces.

                           MARIUS
                   It is good to see you, Lestat.

                           LESTAT
                   And you. Still wearing the old
                   fashions, I see.

                           MARIUS
                   Old habits die hard.

                           LESTAT
                   How did you manage to slip through
                   the 1950s in red velvet?

                              MARIUS
                   I slept.

                           LESTAT
                   Don't think you missed much.

                              MARIUS
                   Elvis.

                           LESTAT
                   Elvis, yes.

                           MARIUS
                      (holding up the
                       Rolling Stone)
                   You're bigger than he is now.

                           LESTAT
                   I'd say a few pounds lighter.
                   Though, if you ever catch me
                   wearing a white jumpsuit, you have
                   my permission to slice off my
                   head.

                           MARIUS
                   If someone doesn't get to you
                   first.

      Lestat grins, feeling Marius's disapproval.

                           LESTAT
                   Live and let live.

                           MARIUS
                   If it were only so simple, my son.

                                             (CONTINUED)

118   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             118

                                 LESTAT
                          (a beat)
                   How did you find me?

                                 MARIUS
                   You forget. We ancients have
                   powers no ordinary vampires
                   possess... And I know you. I
                   remembered how you admired the
                   medieval fortresses in the
                   hilltowns of Lyon.
                          (gestures to house)
                   All you're missing is the moat
                   and the cannons... which you
                   may need.

      Lestat doesn't want to hear it.

                           LESTAT
                   Come, let me show you what it
                   means to live in the light.


119   EXT. SUNSET BLVD. - CONTINUOUS ACTION                         119

      Lestat and Marius sit perched on a giant billboard
      advertising Lestat's concert. Down below, Sunset Strip
      is filled with Goths, club hoppers, HONKING CARS, a
      traffic jam.

                           MARIUS
                      (sarcastic)
                   Impressive. Reminds me of mad old
                   Druids running around chanting in
                   the forest. Very primitive stuff.

                           LESTAT
                   Out there. My fans. Thousands and
                   thousands. They worship me.
                   Millions of arms reach out to
                   embrace, beg me to come into their
                   lives.

                           MARIUS
                   It's what you've always wanted.

                           LESTAT
                   With all my black little heart.

                           MARIUS
                   Do you think of anyone but
                   yourself?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                            72.

119   CONTINUED:                                                  119

                           LESTAT
                   I only have myself.

                           MARIUS
                   It may be time to get ready for
                   some company.

                           LESTAT
                   What's that supposed to mean?

                           MARIUS
                   Your music's woken a very old
                   friend...

      Lestat looks at Marius, trying to understand.

                           MARIUS
                   Can't you hear it? Or is the
                   applause all you can hear now?

      Marius becomes eerily still. A deep, somber TONE starts
      to VIBRATE. The GROUND RUMBLES. Lestat taken aback,
      remembers the scope of Marius's power. Lestat stares at
      Marius, then closes his eyes...


120   CLOSE ON LESTAT'S EYES                                      120

      As the sounds of the WORLD seem to FADE AWAY, revealing
      beneath the cacophony of mortals a DEEP PULSE like the
      beating of a heart the size of a planet.


121   BACK TO SCENE                                               121

      Lestat suddenly opens his eyes as the sounds of the WORLD
      rush BACK IN. Marius stares for a beat, then --

                           MARIUS
                   Akasha has risen. She has taken
                   her King's blood. Absorbed his
                   power. You've done it this time.

      Lestat stares at Marius, letting the knowledge sink in.
      Then he grins.

                           LESTAT
                   Good! I'm glad she's risen!     Let
                   her come.

                           MARIUS
                   Don't you understand?   You must
                   stop this concert!

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                                 73.

                           LESTAT
                      (shakes his head at
                       Marius)
                   200 years and the same broken
                   record.

                           MARIUS
                   No. Not the same! You've only
                   known Akasha dormant. She too
                   will find you. She is choosing
                   her moment. She has come to
                   destroy you, Lestat. And in her
                   wrath, she will devour everything
                   that moves. Mortal and vampire
                   alike.

                           LESTAT
                      (smiles at Marius,
                       softly)
                   Well then, it's every vampire for
                   himself. Just the kind of rules I
                   like. The rules you taught me.

      Marius is enraged, tries to control himself.      Lestat
      gazes at him, speaks steadily.

                           LESTAT
                   Do you remember your first words
                   to me, Marius? 'I am unknowable.'
                      (shakes his head)
                   I'd rather not exist at all than
                   have to live eternally as a ghost.

                           MARIUS
                   And you're taking everyone with
                   you, you fool! We were once
                   mortals, too. It is our heritage
                   we protect!

                           LESTAT
                      (moving away)
                   Such reverence for mortals! Then
                   you should have left me as one!

                           MARIUS
                   You're a monster.

                           LESTAT
                      (shakes his head with a
                       dark laugh)
                   Said the vampire to his son.

      Lestat turns, leaps off the billboard, disappearing into
      the black night. Marius stands alone.

                                             CUT TO:

                                                               74.

122   INT. VAMPIRE COVEN BAR (LONDON/SOHO) - NIGHT                   122

      No mortals in sight. Amongst various vampires, we spy
      the Vampire Lover talking to the Punk Vampire who tried
      to attack Jesse.


123   EXT. VAMPIRE BAR - FRONT DOOR                                  123

      The vampire doorman opens the door and peers out.   A
      figure moves towards him...


124   AKASHA                                                         124

      glowing, beautiful, majestic. The vampire doorman is
      frightened, but mesmerized as she moves in...


125   INT. VAMPIRE BAR                                               125

      The barman looks up at the sound of the DOOR SLAMMING.
      He does a double-take and watches in awe as... Akasha
      steps in. Everyone in the bar turns. She smiles at
      all the undead staring at her.

                           AKASHA
                Hello...

      Her eyes sweep the room, taking in every inch, searching,
      then she hears a Vampire Lestat VIDEO PLAYING. She
      whirls around quickly to the TV -- gazes at the video
      intensely. Her eyes narrow, focus on Lestat, speaks as
      if to herself.

                              AKASHA
                Hmmm... his scent is fading.     He
                was here too long ago...

      The Vampire Lover slides up next to her.

                        VAMPIRE LOVER
                You like him, love?

                        AKASHA
                       (still staring at TV)
                He reminds me of someone I know.

                        VAMPIRE LOVER
                All he's gonna remind you of soon
                is a pile of bones. We're gonna
                dismember him. Bleed him dry.

                        AKASHA
                Really? Is that what you're
                going to do?

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                             75.

      She turns to Vampire Lover, takes him in.

      As if with a new idea, smiles at him, moves to the
      dance floor, moving to LESTAT'S MUSIC, her eyes closed,
      swaying sensually, her hips gyrating. The dance is
      seductive, slow, her head thrown back. The vampires
      turn, stare at her, mesmerized, aroused by her
      movements. They move to the dance floor, watching.
      Akasha opens her eyes, smiles at them, then turns to
      Vampire Lover, points to him, beckons. He smiles back,
      happy to be chosen, moves onto the dance floor. She
      dances a little farther away. A game. He laughs.
      Moves closer.


      CLOSE ON VAMPIRE LOVER

      He hears a LAUGH.


      BACK TO AKASHA

      But she's disappeared. He turns. Akasha's behind him
      now. He stares at her. Her hips are gyrating, her
      body slithering. A moan escapes from him. Again, he
      moves to her, reaches for her. She laughs.


      CLOSE ON HIS PUZZLED FACE

      He turns...

      She's dancing across the floor now. Vampire Lover's
      smile is not so friendly now. He steps toward her,
      determined... She moves behind him. Her body pressed up
      tight against his. He smiles, shudders with a rush of
      desire. All the other vampires watch, envious. Her
      lips brush his neck, her hands run up and down his
      body pausing on his chest. He reaches for her. She
      kisses him just as he kissed the mortal girl. On Vampire
      Lover's face, pure pleasure...

                           AKASHA
                   Then again, you could always do
                   this...

      Akasha sinks her fangs into his neck and at the same
      time, plunges her hand down. We can't see where... We
      STAY ON Vampire Lover's face as Akasha disappears FROM
      FRAME. The sound of BONE SNAPPING, the SQUISH of RIPPING FLESH.
       LOUD SUCKING. A look of horror appears on
      Vampire Lover's face. Akasha REAPPEARS. In her hand,
      she now holds...

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                              76.

      ... his dripping heart.    She brings it to her lips, sucks
      again thirstily...

      Vampire Lover gurgles as she sucks the heart to a dry
      husk, then tosses it. She turns back to Vampire Lover,
      his face frozen in a grotesque mask. She laughs, drops
      him unceremoniously to the floor...

      Akasha turns to face the rest of the horrified vampires.
      They begin to back away. But the DOOR LOCKS itself
      LOUDLY.

      Akasha sways again to the music, moving faster now, as if
      refreshed.

                           AKASHA
                   Turn up the music!

      The terrified barman quickly COMPLIES.

                           AKASHA
                      (smiles, to herself)
                   Oh, I do love the 21st Century.

      Akasha turns to the terrified barman again, pulls him
      over the bar and attacks him as if she were just reaching
      for a snack. He flails but is overwhelmed by her
      strength...

      The Vampire Girl who Jesse saw vanish with the Yuppie,
      flies towards Akasha, knife raised, but Akasha just
      turns... Suddenly there is an EXPLOSION of FLAMES. The
      Vampire Girl screams as she is consumed. The piano
      player and guitar player go up in flames...

      All hell breaks loose as the other vampires run for the
      door. The lock won't budge and it's too late anyway as
      the flames overwhelm them...

      And THROUGH the flames, we see Akasha smiling, now
      sucking on the Punk Vampire's aorta like it's a straw.
      She tosses his body, her long tongue slowly licks her
      bloody, thirsty lips. She strides out through the flames.
      In a whispery, sing-song voice.

                                 AKASHA

                   Lesta-at... come out, come out
                   wherever you are.

                                                               77.

126   EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT                                    126

      Marius stands in the hills by the Hollywood sign, gazing
      down, his brow furrowed, at Lestat's fortress-like
      mansion hidden in the canyon below. The WIND BLOWS the
      trees, bushes. Marius turns, uneasy, sensing something,
      peers into the shadows cast by the brightly-lit sign.
      Marius stares as a figure emerges from the shadows.

      It is Mael, a vampire, his face hidden in a cloak.

                        MAEL
                Marius, you've broken your oath.
                You were to watch over Akasha
                and Khayman. You are a great
                disappointment to me.

      Marius looks up to see all the Ancients now stepping
      from the shadows. KHAYMAN, the desert vampire, in
      Egyptian dress along with PANDORA, the dark-haired
      beauty in her sari, ARMAND, the boy sage, in his
      Mesopotamian robes. Last, MAHARET steps from her
      grand door. She is beautiful with long red hair,
      alabaster skin.

                        MARIUS
                Pandora, Armand, it's been a long
                time. Khayman, Maharet, to what do
                I owe this honor?

                        KHAYMAN
                You have been summoned because of
                your errant child...

      Khayman crosses to the edge, peers menacingly into the
      distance at Lestat's house.

                             PANDORA
                   (giving deep,
                    sexy laugh)
                He's quite the devil, isn't he?

                        ARMAND
                His music mocks us, Pandora!

                        PANDORA
                His music moves my blood.

                         ARMAND
                Keep your amorous thoughts to
                yourself. His music is a threat
                to all vampires. We will let the
                covens dismember him at his
                concert.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                            78.

                            MAEL
                   Yes.   It will set an example.

                            MARIUS
                   I don't see how this solves
                   things. This isn't thought
                   through.

                           KHAYMAN
                   Marius, we understand your
                   affection for Lestat, but your
                   duty is to us!

      He gazes again down at Lestat's house with a threatening
      glance. Turns to Marius with a look of warning.

                                 KHAYMAN
                   We could always get rid of him
                   right now.

                                MAEL
                   No. We will contact the covens.
                   Let them know we condone the
                   slaying. It will be better for
                   all to see.

      Marius, with a tortured expression, gazes at Mael.
      Maharet steps up.

                           MAHARET
                   Wait. Never mind Lestat!   We
                   have greater problems...

                           MARIUS
                          (stepping up)
                   Maharet is right. It is Akasha
                   we face now.

                           PANDORA
                      (joyous)
                   Is it true, Maharet?   Has our
                   Queen really risen!

                           MAHARET
                   Don't be so happy, Pandora. I
                   knew Akasha when she walked this
                   earth. I was her slave. I am now
                   her enemy. I know what she is
                   capable of.

126   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            126

                           ARMAND
                   Yes. We've all felt her presence,
                   even as she hides from us.
                      (as others nod,
                       acknowledging the
                       truth of this)
                   What does she want now?

                           MAHARET
                   She knows only one thing. Taking
                   pleasure in destroying life. She
                   is already killing the young ones
                   to build her strength.

                           MARIUS
                   She's sucked the life out of her
                   King like a praying mantis. I
                   sense she is getting closer.

                           MAHARET
                   She has come to destroy Lestat,
                   but he will only whet her thirst
                   more...

      The Ancients look to each other, taking this in.
      Pandora looks around, suddenly nervous.

                           MAHARET
                   If we act together, we have a
                   chance to destroy her.

      They all gaze at Maharet, astonished.

                           MAHARET
                   Yes! We must destroy her
                   immediately! If she is not
                   stopped, I'm afraid of what will
                   happen to the entire mortal world.

                           MAEL
                   But can she be destroyed? I am
                   left to bear the scars of the last
                   attempt on her life. She was
                   dragged into the sun. She
                   survived. But we almost didn't...

      Removing his hood, we see his terribly-burned face.   They
      all stare at him.

                            MARIUS
                   What happens to our Queen happens
                   to us. If Akasha dies, we die
                   as well.

                           MAHARET
                   Then so be it! We must take that
                   chance.

      She gazes at them all intensely, as the meaning of her
      words sink in.

                           MAHARET
                   We must destroy Akasha. For the
                   sake of humanity! We must find
                   her. Now!

                           ARMAND
                   But perhaps she has come to kill
                   Lestat and then will go back to her
                   slumber. That is our only hope.

                           PANDORA
                      (eager)
                   Yes. That's right. She and the
                   covens will take care of that
                   brat. We must go to the concert
                   and pay our respects to our great
                   Queen.

                           MAHARET
                   How? With your own throat!
                   You've all been asleep too long!
                   You're still dreaming.

      Marius steps up beside Maharet.

                           MARIUS
                   Maharet speaks the truth.   It is
                   our only hope.

      Marius then goes and stands beside Maharet and Khayman.
      The others gaze at the three standing together now.

                           MAEL
                   No. Armand is right. We will go
                   to the concert and first see what
                   she does. There may be no need
                   for action.

      Pandora and Armand nod their assent. The two groups face
      each other. Maharet gazes at their faces, spits out
      the words.

                   Then you go to the concert and you
                   shall see!
                          (shakes her head)
                   And I thought the Ancients became
                   wise with their years.

      As we REMAIN ON the Ancient Ones, AKASHA'S HEARTBEAT
      creeps back in over... Marius gazes again down at
      Lestat's house, anguish on his face.


      INT. MERCEDES - CLOSER ON ROGER - NIGHT

      cruising the Hollywood streets, wearing sunglasses,
      hat. He sees something.


      ROGER'S POV

      A Goth girl on the street in front of a record store.


      BACK TO ROGER

      He sighs, pulls over.    Gets out.


      EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

      Behind him now we see a cab pull over. It's Jesse,
      trailing Roger. She gazes at him intently.


      JESSE'S POV

      Roger's back is TO us as he talks to a Goth girl in a
      whisper.


      BACK TO JESSE

      Jesse pays the driver.    Gets out.   Gazes at Roger.


127   INT. LESTAT'S HOUSE (LOS ANGELES) - SOUND STUDIO - NIGHT      127

      LOUD, intense MUSIC as the band rehearses. Lestat
      creates a fantastic melody around the beat. He lets
      the note trail off, eyes closed, smiling, the
      REVERB still RINGING in the room. Lestat hears
      something, turns. Outside, in the Hollywood Hills,
      DOGS are HOWLING across the canyons like wolves.
      Lestat crosses to the huge glass doors, goes outside...

                                                             82.

128   EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               128

      Lestat stares out at the ominous night. As Maudy and the
      band continue to play, the wolflike HOWLS in the night
      get LOUDER. And beneath it all, a DEEP PULSE BEATS. The
      song comes to an end. Lestat turns, gazes back at the
      band THROUGH the window, at their excitement. He comes
      back inside.


129   INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               129

      Roger now stands there, a nervous look on his face.

                        ROGER
                The... girls you asked for, Lestat.
                They're here, in the guest wing.

                         LESTAT
                Ah.   Yes.

      Lestat gazes in that direction, pensive.

                        ROGER
                I was uh... just gonna go catch a
                movie at the Chinese. I don't
                suppose you'd all want to...

      Lestat smiles at the clumsy attempt to protect the girls.

                        LESTAT
                No, thank you, Roger.   We'll
                entertain ourselves.

      As Roger leads Lestat to the guest room, he can hear
      FAINT GIGGLING. Lestat turns back to the night. The
      PULSE of Akasha still ECHOES in his ears.


130   INT. GUEST WING - JUST AFTER                                 130

      Roger and Lestat walk in.   A young GROUPIE giggles
      nervously.

                        GROUPIE #3
                Oh my God, it's him!    It's really
                him...

      She turns in paroxysm of excitement to the girl next to
      her. Lestat stares, taken aback. It is Jesse. Dressed
      in Goth gear. Jesse stares back at Lestat brazenly. A
      long moment.

                        LESTAT
                Perhaps you would like a tour
                of the place... first.

                           GROUPIE #3
                   Oh yeah, wow, we'd love that.

                           LESTAT
                   Roger... would you be so kind?

                           ROGER
                      (surprised, relieved)
                   Sure. Right this way, girls.

      As they start off, Lestat puts up his hand, points to
      Jesse.

                            LESTAT
                   Roger. Not that one.   Leave her
                   to me...

      The other groupie pouts, disappointed. She goes out
      with Roger. Lestat turns to Jesse... considers her...

                                      LESTAT
                   You must be very keen to die.

      Jesse's heart pounds with terror.

                           LESTAT
                   The Talamascans have become quite
                   stealthy. I didn't know
                   infiltration was quite their style.

                           JESSE
                   It's not. I... I came on my own.

      He stares at her, taking her in.


                                 LESTAT
                   How did you find me?

                                 JESSE
                   I've been tracking your manager
                   for days...
                          (gesturing to her
                           Goth outfit)
                   Then I figured out you simply
                   have to look the part.

                           LESTAT
                   Clever librarian... You should
                   know, based on all your research,
                   that groupies don't ever find
                   their way out of here again.

                   I'm not a groupie...

      Lestat gazes at Jesse's pulsing jugular.      He steps
      closer.

                           LESTAT
                   Then why are you following me?
                   What do you want?

                           JESSE
                      (terrified, in
                       a whisper)
                   Are you granting wishes?

                           LESTAT
                      (smiles, in a whisper
                       playing    with her)
                   Last wishes. What's yours?

                           JESSE
                   Show me what it's like to be you.
                   That's my last wish. Grant it,
                   Lestat.

      He stares at her, feeling some connection with this
      strange mortal girl. She stares at him with penetrating
      eyes. He again finds himself drawn to her. Tries to
      fight it.

                           LESTAT
                      (turning away)
                   I don't have time for this.

                           JESSE
                   All a vampire has is time.

                           LESTAT
                   Maybe not.

                           JESSE
                      (softly)
                   Right. The covens are coming for
                   you.
                          (softly)
                   I understand why you're doing it.
                   You have to be who you are, no
                   matter what happens.

      He turns, gazes at her.       She steps forward.

                           JESSE
                   But how are you spending what may
                   be your last night on Earth,
                   Lestat? As you always have...
                   Alone.

      Jesse takes a breath, crosses to him, stands very close,
      stares up into his eyes. He stares down at her, amazed,
      his heart pounding. He breathes in her hair, the scent
      of her skin.

                           JESSE
                   Don't kill me yet. Let's spend
                   our last nights together. Share
                   it with me.   Show me what it's
                   like to be you.

                           LESTAT
                   You don't know what you're asking!
                   I don't know what's in that
                   librarian's head of yours, but it's
                   not what you think.

                                 JESSE
                   That's right. You don't know
                   what's in my head, Lestat. Do
                   you want to?

                                 LESTAT
                   I'll know when I kill you.

                           JESSE
                   Gee, Lestat, that's a great way to
                   get to know someone. Here. I'll
                   give you a preview. Coming
                   attractions. This is what you'll
                   find.

      She crosses to him, stands close.

                                 JESSE
                   I have this recurring dream that
                   I'm a child and I'm living in
                   this big house filled with
                   vampires. And every night when I
                   go to sleep, I wish to God the
                   same thing... you know what that
                   is, Lestat?

      He gazes at her.    She leans forward.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                           JESSE
                   That I will have the dream again...
                   Because in the dream I'm happy.
                   And the dream is more real than my
                   life... I don't know how, but I
                   know you, Lestat... My life is a
                   big mystery and you, you have the
                   answer...

      He gazes at her, being taken in, tries to resist it.
      Jesse moves even closer. He stares down at her, the
      softness of her skin, her penetrating gaze, the heat
      of her body.

                                 JESSE
                   I can't go on pretending this life
                   of mine is real. I can't live a
                   lie... I'm just like you Lestat.
                   We're the same...

                                 LESTAT
                          (softly)
                   Are we? I seek the light.     You
                   seek the shadows.

                                JESSE
                   No. We're looking for exactly the
                   same thing. You know it...
                   Please. Show me.

      He stares at her. Her eyes gazing directly into
      his... Suddenly...

                              LESTAT
                   Alright!

      Jesse breaks into a smile.

                           LESTAT
                   This may be painful for a mortal.
                   You're still attached to your skin.

                           JESSE
                          (an excited whisper)
                   I don't care.

                           LESTAT
                   Close your eyes.    Don't breathe.

      Her heart pounding, fluttering her eyes closed, Jesse
      holds one deep, hesitant breath and... Flash -- with
      preternatural speed --

                                                               87.

131   LESTAT AND JESSE                                               131

      whisk through the night, flashing past trees and
      houses. Opening her eyes for a moment, Jesse watches
      the world whiz past her at incredible speed and
      suddenly -- they stop on a dime.

      Jesse gasps, catching her breath to find herself at
      Hollywood's highest peak overlooking the city laying
      out before her like a glimmering blanket.


132   EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - NIGHT                         132

      Looking out over the observatory's ledge, Jesse can't
      believe what's just happened. She laughs, intoxicated by
      the experience.

                        JESSE
                Do that again!

      Lestat laughs, impressed by her bravado. Her trust. For
      a moment she laughs like a child. Then they look at each
      other deeply, feeling something. He wants to kiss her.
      She knows it. He turns away.

                              LESTAT
                And now for my next trick.

      Lestat pulls out a knife, quickly slices his arm open.

      Jesse gazes at his blood dripping down his arm, something
      stirring in her. Magically, the wound heals up. She
      stares, impressed.

                                 JESSE
                Did it hurt?

                        LESTAT
                Yes. For just a moment. But as
                the pain is more intense for us,
                so is ecstacy.
                   (gazes at her)
                You see, we love our victims.

                          JESSE
                Love?    I thought it was the blood.

                              LESTAT
                No, although the taste is so rich
                and sweet. Love is the essence of
                the dark gift. The connection is
                so much more satisfying, brief as
                it is, than anything else.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                                    88.

132   CONTINUED:                                                          132

      Lestat again becomes aware of Jesse's pulsing jugular,
      the white flesh of her neck. He reaches out, touches her
      neck, strokes it. Jesse shivers under his touch,
      terrified, but wanting more. Lestat brushes his lips
      against her hair, her neck. Runs his hands down her
      arms. She closes her eyes, lost in the gentle rhythm
      of his voice.

                           LESTAT
                   As you drink, you feel the heart
                   weakening... it struggles even
                   though there's no hope. You feel
                   the life slipping away, the flash
                   of those brief years. The taste
                   of mortality you can no longer
                   experience... and it is
                   beautiful...
                      (pulls away sharply)
                   No 'relationship,' no commingling
                   can ever reach the heights of that
                   experience.

      But Jesse steps forward.       Lestat turns, stares at her.

      Her eyes burn with an urge that will not be silenced.
      One button at a time, her fingers quivering, she opens
      her blouse down to her navel.

      Lestat stares as Jesse removes a long, silver hairpin
      from the mane of her red locks which then cascade about
      her shoulders. Her face remains aimed unwavering at
      Lestat's as she brings the hairpin down to her breast.

      With her eyes moored to his, she draws a line with the
      point across her breast. She inhales through clenched
      teeth... then settles as we see:

      The long incision go from pink to red; then the blood,
      like a hot spring pouring over the brim and dripping
      down her chest.

      Lestat staggers. Breaking their stare, he accepts her
      gift, lapping up the overspill and then onto the wound
      itself. Lestat closes her eyes... He comes up to her
      face, brushing his lips against her cheek. She
      shivers...

                           LESTAT
                      (groans)
                   Your blood...

                           JESSE
                      (murmurs)
                   Do you like it?

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                               89.

                           LESTAT
                      (losing himself)
                   Yes...

      He comes down to her slender neck.     Stares at the soft,
      pulsing skin. He bares his fangs.

                           JESSE
                      (whispering, overcome)
                   Do it to me... Please... With your
                   blood I'll know you...


133   CLOSE ON LESTAT                                                133

      He can't help himself.    He moves to Jesse's white neck...
      closer... closer...

                                 JESSE
                   I'll know everything...

      But suddenly her words catch him... His head flails as he
      tries to stop his natural impulse. Lestat lets out a
      desperate cry and throws her aside. Jesse gazes at him,
      surprised. He looms over her, angry.

                           LESTAT
                   You want to know everything. You
                   want to see what it's like. Then
                   come! I'll show you.


134   EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT                                     134

      Lestat and Jesse quietly move among the trees. Lestat
      stops on a dime -- senses tuned. He looks into the dark.
      Jesse is about to speak when Lestat raises his finger to
      her lips and then points at... A couple of lovers moving
      across the meadow. They sit on a park bench. The woman
      giggles drunkenly. Jesse watches and gasps as she
      realizes the male lover is a vampire. Lestat moves
      forward. Jesse gingerly follows.

      Taking his lover in his arms the vampire begins to bite
      her neck... Lestat looks over at Jesse who watches,
      fascinated and disturbed. The vampire senses another's
      presence -- stops and turns to reveal his vampire eyes
      shining in the dark. Lestat steps into the halo of a
      street lamp and hisses. Sensing Lestat's power, the
      vampire hisses and instantly -- the vampire is gone.
      Jesse turns to Lestat but he has disappeared, too.
      Spinning around again she sees... Lestat hovering over
      the mortal woman who is still in a swoon. Checking to
      see that the vampire is gone, Jesse moves closer to the
      bench.
                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                              90.

134   CONTINUED:                                                    134

                           JESSE
                   Is she alright?

      Lestat looks up to face her, revealing his blood-stained
      lips. Jesse reflexively looks away.

                           LESTAT
                   Come closer, Jesse. You want to
                   see? You want to know?

                           JESSE
                   Lestat, no!

      Lestat's expression turns cold as ice -- he arches his
      back like a great cat and goes in for the kill. The
      woman's body convulses... Jesse watches in horror as...
      the woman's hands clutch at Lestat, her back stiffens...
      finally her legs relax in an obscene parody of orgasm.
      Jesse gasps, backs away. Lestat finishes and, wiping his
      mouth, approaches Jesse.

                           LESTAT
                   You see now? Are you ready?     Now
                   do you want it?!

      He gazes into her eyes, finding himself desperately
      wanting her to say yes. The horror, the revulsion in
      Jesse's face says it all.

                            LESTAT
                   No.   Of course you don't.

      She backs away from him, now terrified. Something's
      changed in his eyes. They are cold, blank.

                           LESTAT
                   Well I didn't grant your final
                   wish.
                      (shakes his head)
                   It was an impossible wish to begin
                   with. You see, I am unknowable.

      His eyes still as death, he starts moving away.

                             JESSE
                   Lestat!    Wait!

      Lestat turns toward her suddenly, grabs her forcefully,
      pulls her into his arms, gazes into her eyes.

                           LESTAT
                   Good-bye, Talamascan.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                              91.

134   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             134

      Jesse closes her eyes in terror, knowing her life is
      about to be over.

      Then Jesse reaches for her mouth as if she were touched
      by something when... the IMAGE of Lestat's lips kissing
      her lips flashes by in VAMPIRE TIME as... Jesse's face is
      completely still in HUMAN TIME. As her hand drops, she
      realizes what just happened. And with that, Lestat
      disappears. She stares into the night. There's a SWISH
      and the sound of RUSHING AIR. Jesse turns, screams,
      backs away. It's not Lestat standing there at all but
      Mael, the Druid vampire. With great speed he glides
      towards her, envelops Jesse in his cloak, muffling her
      cries... WHOOSH.

                                              CUT TO:

      PULL BACK to reveal a porcelain doll, beautiful, perfect
      but unsettling. We TRACK ACROSS rows and rows of dolls
      from different eras. TRACK PAST the billowing floor-to-
      ceiling curtains to reveal Jesse -- still an adult, but
      lying awake in bed just as she had as a little girl.
      Jesse gets out of bed, trapped in her own childhood
      memory. Is she dreaming now?


138   INT. DESERT MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT                         138

      Making her way down a long hall she passes an amazing
      array of medieval tapestries.


139   FLASHBACK - INT. HALLWAY                                      139

      Jesse as a child picking at the thread of a wall-hanging
      in a large room.


140   BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)                                       140

      She stands wondering -- eyes moving back and forth with
      rapid thoughts when... She sees a door at the end of the
      hall. Walking a little faster now, she draws toward it
      as...

                                                               92.

141   FLASHBACK - INT. HALLWAY                                       141

      Jesse as a little girl, wanders down a similar hall
      toward what sounds like a COCKTAIL PARTY. Reaching the
      thick wooden door she peeps through to see...


142   BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)                                        142

      Jesse stares up at an enormous mural dominating the far
      wall -- a mural of names, a family tree -- extending up
      onto the ceiling and down to the floor.


143   FLASHBACK - MURAL                                              143

      Jesse, as a little girl, walking beside Maharet, looks up
      at the mural.

                        YOUNG JESSE
                   (furious)
                Why can't I stay with you?!
                Please, Auntie Maharet!

                        MAHARET
                I don't want you to go, but you
                must.

      A tear of blood trickles down Maharet's cheek.

                        YOUNG JESSE
                Auntie, you're bleeding...

      Jesse takes the tear and goes to put it to her mouth but
      Maharet violently grabs her hand. Young Jesse is
      frightened.

                        MAHARET
                You must be with your own, my
                sweetest girl. I'll always be
                watching over you.

                        YOUNG JESSE
                I want to stay with you forever.


144   BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)                                        144

      Jesse stares into nothingness.   Again the voice, but much
      gentler.

                        MAHARET
                Forever is a very long time.

      Jesse looks up out of her memory to see in the doorway
      down the end of the hall...

                   Hello, my princess.

                           JESSE
                   Aunt Maharet?

      Jesse rushes to her. Stops. Stares at her aunt's
      glowing eyes, the strange pallor of her skin.

                           JESSE
                   You're a...?

                           MAHARET
                   Yes. Oh, Jesse, I've missed you
                   so much, but I had to keep this
                   from you.

      Jesse stands there, soaking it in.    Maharet takes her
      hands gently.

                           JESSE
                   Oh my God, this is why... I knew I
                   was different. I knew --

                           MAHARET
                      (strongly)
                   Come...

      Jesse follows Maharet to the mural of the family tree.

                           MAHARET
                   You are the most precious of my
                   great family...

                              JESSE
                   Am I...?

                           MAHARET
                      (strongly)
                   No. You are not. I was once
                   mortal, too. My sister died
                   before her child was one year old.
                   I took care of that child, and her
                   children, and her children's
                   children...

      Pointing up to the huge family tree...

                           MAHARET
                   This is our family -- my way of
                   coping with eternity. The
                   labyrinth of life. The family
                   teaches me the rhythms and
                   passions of each age.

      Her finger trails down the great line to a name --
      "Jessica Reeves"...

                           MAHARET
                   You are my most prized light. You
                   are what keeps me connected to the
                   world of the living.

      Jesse stares at Maharet, amazed.

                           MAHARET
                   When your parents died I took you
                   to India to take care of you.

                           JESSE
                   And something happened there.

                           MAHARET
                   I stopped it from happening.    And
                   I will again.

      Maharet stands close, gazes at her.

                                      MAHARET
                   Jesse, you must stay away from
                   Lestat. You must forget all about
                   him.

      Jesse looks at her, surprised.    Maharet smiles.

                           MAHARET
                   Yes, I know about your new friend.
                   You think you love him, but it's
                   not as you thought it would be.

      Jesse stares at Maharet, surprised she understands so
      well.

                           JESSE
                   I thought I was like him.

                           MAHARET
                   I know, but it is not who you are,
                   not who you are meant to be. You
                   have found that out now.

      Jesse sits on a stone bench, confused.       Maharet smiles
      sadly, feeling Jesse's inner turmoil.

                           JESSE
                   Lestat's all I can think about...
                   I felt like I belonged with him.
                   Now I know why...

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                              95.

144   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             144

      Maharet sits beside her, speaks emphatically.

                           MAHARET
                   Jesse, you must forget about him.
                   You must trust me...

                            JESSE
                      (gazes up at her
                       a long moment)
                   I missed you so much, Aunt
                   Maharet.

                             MAHARET
                   Me too.

      Just then the gloom of the pre-dawn's light begins to
      illuminate the windows of the great hall.

                            MAHARET
                   You will go home to London in the
                   morning.

      Jesse holds Maharet's eyes.

                           JESSE
                   But this is my home. This is
                   where I belong. Why do you want
                   to get rid of me so quickly?

      Maharet touches her face gently.

                           MAHARET
                   Now is not the time to be here...

      The light is getting brighter.    Maharet stands.

                           MAHARET
                   You were seeking answers. Now
                   you have found them. The family
                   is who you are.

      Maharet goes to Jesse, wraps her arms tight around Jesse.
      Despite the coldness of her skin, Jesse warms to the
      embrace, closes her eyes, holds her tight. Then, beaten
      by the sun, Maharet stands, exits into the shadows, turns
      back to Jesse, gazes at her.

                                 MAHARET
                   You will go home to London
                   tomorrow.

                                                               96.

145   INT. LESTAT'S ROOM - NIGHT                                     145

      Lestat stands by his bed, playing the ancient violin... a
      long mournful note. He stops a moment, lost in his
      thoughts. A flash of the first morning light reflects
      off the ancient wood. Lestat puts the violin away. A
      tear of blood trickles down his cheek. His face is
      filled with sadness at what will never be. A word
      escapes from his lips.

                        LESTAT
                   (whisper)
                Jesse.

      Lestat draws the curtains and enters his sanctum where
      his coffin sits in the safety of darkness.


146   EXT. MAHARET'S DESERT MANSION - DAY                            146

      The sun breaks through the date palms.


147   INT. MANSION - JUST AFTER                                      147

      Jesse moves down the hallway past paintings of vampires.
      She pauses at one of Maharet. As Jesse shifts, the glass
      over the painting catches Jesse's reflection. Jesse
      moves slowly until her face just covers Maharet's. In
      the reflection, Jesse's eyes now glow with Maharet's
      luminescence. Jesse stares a long, long moment.


148   INT. MANSION - JUST AFTER                                      148

      Jesse sits at a desk, writing a note, torment, confusion
      on her face.

                         JESSE (V.O.)
                Dear Aunt Maharet, my whole life,
                I've felt... kind of crazy I
                guess, different from everyone,
                and now I know why... You say I
                now know who I am meant to be...
                I have found my answers. You are
                right...

      She takes a deep breath.


149   EXT. MAHARET'S DESERT MANSION - FRONT ENTRANCE -               149
      CONTINUOUS ACTION

      Jesse moves to the front entrance, gazes at the walls
      surrounding the front gate.

                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                             97.

149   CONTINUED:                                                   149

                           JESSE (V.O.)
                   I know you want me to be a regular
                   human girl... but I'm not. I
                   can't be...

      She looks back at the house, then quickly slips out the
      gate.


150   EXT. MAHARET'S DESERT MANSION - DAY                          150

      Maharet's sprawling compound sits alone in the empty
      desert. Nothing for as far as the eye can see.

                           JESSE (V.O.)
                   Lestat is my destiny... I know
                   that now. I love you, Aunt
                   Maharet. Good-bye.

      Jesse walks away from the house. Coming to a highway,
      she reads a sign -- "DEATH VALLEY 120 miles." Just then,
      a VW minibus barrels down the road in Jesse's direction.
      She sticks out her thumb... The minibus pulls to a stop
      on the shoulder in a cloud of dust. A VAMPIRE DRIVER
      leans out the window -- not a real vampire, just a kid
      with white face-paint and fake fangs.

                           VAMPIRE DRIVER
                   Need a ride?

      Jesse peers past the driver to a crowd of Goths and fake
      vampires. THE VAMPIRE LESTAT BLARES FROM the SPEAKERS.

                           JESSE
                      (smiles)
                   Yeah.


151   EXT. DEATH VALLEY - FROM HIGH ABOVE - DUSK                   151

      We see a line of traffic snake out along a desert road
      toward a strange red glow rising into the dark night sky.
      A distant sound of DRUMS BEATING chaotic rhythms is
      heard. As we FLY CLOSER, the DRUMMING becomes LOUDER and
      clearer. Until we are RIGHT ABOVE an incredible scene...
      A mass of people (30,000) gather in a valley of red rock.

                                             CUT TO:


152   EXT. CONCERT ENTRANCE - NIGHT                                152

      Looking at the scene, Jesse is bedazzled. Pushing
      through people, she disappears into the throng as...

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                               98.

152   CONTINUED:                                                     152

                            DAVID (O.S.)
                   Jesse!


153   ANGLE ON DAVID TALBOT                                          153

      as he pushes through the sea of white paint and plastic
      vampire teeth. But she has disappeared. Talbot is
      jostled, dropping his glasses on the ground.

                           VOICE (O.S.)
                   Sorry, Grandpa!

      Talbot crouches down and finds his glasses.     Reemerging,
      he senses something and looks up.


154   FULL SHOT - MARIUS                                             154

      watching him at a distance. Next to the real thing, all
      these fake vampires look ridiculous.

                           MARIUS
                      (quietly)
                   Hello, David.


155   ON TALBOT                                                      155

      Speechless.

                           MARIUS
                   I must show you my new paintings
                   sometime.

      Marius smiles. Talbot is awestruck -- the goal of a
      lifetime's searching. He tries to say something, but
      it's too late. Flash. Marius is moving through the
      crowd at unnatural speed. Enormous pipes spout flames
      high into the sky, run like a corridor of red light
      along the crowd, leading to two enormous Egyptian
      effigies of Akasha and Enkil flanking a stage at the
      top end. And before the stage stretches a mass of
      human bacchanalian debauchery... Woodstock on mescaline.
      Naked bodies, pierced and tattooed, mingle with the
      strangest of fashions as crowds gather in circles
      around their own lit fires, drumming out awesome rhythms.

      The whole place is an enormous flaming mosh pit   -- naked
      bodies walk across heads of people while others   get
      tossed and thrown. This crowd is determined to    get
      what they were promised... Nothing like they've   ever
      seen.

                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                            99.

      A new world, a world of the initiated who have somehow
      managed to include themselves in the select number of
      attendees to a sacred rite. And among the mortals are
      the immortals. Amidst them we see the tattooed Vampires,
      the Armani Vampire, the others, now dressed in cloaks
      which they use to hide their knives and sickles.


156   HIGH ABOVE VALLEY                                           156

      Standing on the strange rocks are the Ancient vampires,
      except for Maharet. Some of whom can't help but smile
      at the scene below. Marius is now with them.

                           PANDORA
                      (wistful, to Mael)
                   It's just like Nero's day.

      They scan the horizon, the darkening sky.

                                      MAHARET
                   Akasha will not be able to resist
                   this...

      The CROWD begins to CLAP -- DRUMS from different circles
      begin to impatiently BEAT into one deafening rhythm.


157   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                      157

      Backstage is all abuzz with pre-show energy; press
      everywhere. Roger still worrying and sweating. James,
      Alex and Maudy sit in their own circle, jamming with
      their unplugged instruments, psyching themselves up for
      the biggest night of their lives.


158   INT. LESTAT'S HONEY-WAGON - NIGHT                           158

      Lestat stretches out with his eyes closed as the sounds
      of the DRUMMING crowd begin to make the whole van
      shudder. Roger pops his head in.

                           ROGER
                   They're getting pretty worked up
                   out there.


159   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                      159

      Lestat emerges from his honey-wagon, splendid in his
      concert costume. He looks ready for business, whatever
      may happen. The band look at each other, then look to
      Lestat. This is the moment. He smiles like a father
      at them.

                   Come on, children.

      Alex, Maudy and James start beating out the rhythm with
      the crowd as they move through backstage. The DRUM BEATS
      RISE to a CRESCENDO.


160   BACK TO CROWD                                                160

      Jesse makes her way through the throng, trying to get
      closer to the stage. Suddenly the torches go out sending
      the place into utter darkness. A stunned moment. The
      place goes berserk. We see the dim figures of the band
      take their places. Jesse desperately tries to push
      toward the front.


161   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                       161

      Lestat readies himself as he scans the valley from behind
      a speaker, and sees...


162   LESTAT'S POV - VAMPIRES                                      162

      wait here and there in the audience, set to attack.


163   BACK TO LESTAT                                               163

      who smiles to himself.


164   BACK IN CROWD                                                164

      BOOM, the torches relight and an enormous CHORD surges
      through the crowd louder than a jet on takeoff. The mass
      surges forward... The stage lights up in a huge halo of
      blood-red light. The band plays a hypnotic tune that
      would put the devil in a spell, as... We wait for Lestat.
      The band keeps playing the pounding cadence, as...

      The audience doesn't see Lestat anywhere and cheers over
      the sound, and it seems as if the whole of Death Valley
      is shaking, when... Lestat appears above the stage,
      inhumanly levitating and...

                           LESTAT
                   I'm so glad I decided to rise...
                      (shouting)
                   After tonight, Death Valley will
                   live up to its name!

164   CONTINUED:                                                   164

      The place erupts into one solid scream as the band kicks
      it in.

      He swoops down through the air over the stage and into
      their very midst. Jesse, in the crowd, screams up to
      him... But her voice is lost in the thousands of screams
      for him. Lestat takes the microphone and leans his lips
      into it, letting his voice soar into an inhuman note,
      filling the valley like a demon demanding heaven be
      replaced with hell.


165   AT BACK OF CONCERT - MIXING BOARD                            165

      Two STUDIO ENGINEERS sit dazed.

                           ENGINEER #1
                      (Cockney accent)
                   Could we turn it down a tad?

      The second Engineer looks to the mixing panel.

                           ENGINEER #2
                   His mic's not even up.

      They stare, dumbfounded.


166   BACK TO CONCERT                                              166

      The pulsing strain moves into a faster beat as the whole
      place resonates with the most incredible harmonics, the
      energy throbbing, the crowd almost genuflecting in front
      of this papal devil. All move and sway except for...
      Jesse, desperately squeezing through bodies trying to get
      closer and closer to...

      Lestat, who commands the place with his echoing voice.
      Lestat holds the place in the palm of his hand. Lestat's
      dark soul seems ready to burst as he moves his voice into
      an even higher unworldly octave, and then...


167   LESTAT'S POV                                                 167

      The vampires move through the crowd. Goth girls in the
      front row, weeping... Maudy, James and Alex off in the
      clouds, playing the best music of their lives. The
      place has gone wild, living off its own energy now as
      waves of sound bounce through the valley band up into
      the night sky.

                                                                102.

                        LESTAT
                You want more?!

      The crowd screams...

                         CROWD
                Yes!

                        LESTAT
                This one's for those who've come
                for me!

      All yell that they have, but the covens know it's for
      them. Lestat launches the band into a new number that
      makes the previous song seem like a lullaby. He eyes the
      coven-assassins here and there and sings straight to
      them. His lyrics challenging the assassins, flaunting
      them with satire. Jesse whirls around, spying the
      assassins in the crowd. She shakes her head no...
      The covens need no more encouragement as they begin to
      move through the crowd toward the stage. We RISE UP OVER
      the crowd to see fifty assassins snaking at preternatural
      speed, unseen to all except us in our inhuman vantage.

      Marius spies the covens slipping through the crowd at a
      strange velocity. He looks to Lestat, worried...


170   BACK TO STAGE                                                    170

      The assassins approach closer   -- Lestat assaults with
      relentless lyrics... Reaching   the stage, they are
      suddenly on it -- roadies run   in and are immediately
      cast aside by inhuman powers.    We speed into vampire
      time as... (NOTE: In camera,    no C.G.I.)

      The assassins draw knives and lunge, determined to
      dismember Lestat. Lestat does an acrobatic leap, dodging
      the knives. He rips the microphone from the stand and
      holds it up just in time... as an assassin is impaled.
      The assassin squirms and convulses. The crowd goes
      insane... Lestat snarls at the audience as if this
      really were part of the performance... The assassins
      attack again, this time hurtling massive light stands
      like they were small spears. Lestat dodges them.
      The assassins BREAK GLASS BOTTLES, lunge with the deadly shards.
       (NOTE: Band should not be seen in this part of sequence.)

                                                                  103.

      can hold himself back no longer. He flies over equipment
      and roadies, up into the air. The Ancients gaze after
      him and...

      He lands square in the middle of the fray. Back to
      mortal time. The crowd cheers at the sudden appearance
      of the figure on stage, loving the show. Lestat grins at
      Marius. The band keeps playing. Marius hurls a huge
      LIGHT at the assassins. It EXPLODES as it hits them,
      pinning one with shards. But an assassin hurls a sickle
      at Lestat. Lestat is struck down, his singing stopped.
      The assassins move in.

                 There are too many of them!

      Assassins corner Lestat and Marius -- blades, broken
      bottles reflecting the spotlight. Lestat raises his arms
      for the crowd. The crowd jeers. Lestat looks to Maudy
      and the band.

                         LESTAT
                 Get out of here!

      The band scampers off stage as the assassins fly past,
      the reverb from their guitars whistle into a deafening
      pitch.

      Jesse joins the screaming crowds.

                           JESSE
                 Lestat!    Lestat!

      As the killer vampires make their final move, it looks
      bleak for Lestat... But one after the other they
      spontaneously combust, turning hot-white to black ash
      and drift up into the air like strange supernatural
      kites. The crowd hollers and screams, not quite
      believing what they saw or how it was done, when...
      Down in the throng, vampires also begin to combust -- hot
      flashes of white exploding through the crowd, turning
      into black paper dolls -- wafting up over the valley --
      crumbling into fluttering puffs of soot. Panic takes
      over the mass of people, running in all directions.
      Jesse remains pinned to her spot.


175   LESTAT                                                       175

      stands in wonder as Marius stares up into the high
      darkness.

                           MARIUS
                      (soft, to himself)
                   Akasha.

      The valley fills with hundreds of burning "kites"
      floating like black ghosts. Khayman, Pandora and
      Armand gaze up at the sky.

                           MAHARET
                   She is here...


176   JESSE                                                        176

      stares in wonder and terror at the burning "kites." Then
      seizes her chance. She pushes toward the stage against
      the tide of bodies fleeing.


177   INT. BACKSTAGE - MEANWHILE                                   177

      Roger is trying to manage the building chaos backstage as
      the FIRE MARSHAL and several firemen follow after him.

                           FIRE MARSHAL
                   You don't have a permit for any of
                   these stunts!

                           ROGER
                   I told you I don't know anything
                   about it!

      A WALKIE-TALKIE distracts the Fire Marshal long enough to
      allow Roger to run.

      Looking up at the sky, he stares in awe... There is a low
      powerful RUMBLE...

      The mortal crowd looks around, distracted from their
      panic, as they sense something truly awesome...


178   LESTAT                                                          178

      senses it too. He looks up, not knowing from which
      direction the attack will come. The STAGE starts to
      SHUDDER and SHAKE violently...

      Jesse, now almost to the stage, screams to him.

                             JESSE
                   Lestat!    Lestat!

      Suddenly the wooden platform beneath Lestat begins to
      buckle under his feet. Fragments of WOOD EXPLODE upwards
      around Lestat. Marius loses his balance and staggers
      backwards...

      Fragments of sharp wood fly into the audience. Jesse
      raises her hands to protect herself. She looks up.
      Freezes. Akasha rises up through the stage. Beautiful
      and terrifying. She grabs Lestat and the two of them
      shoot up into the air. The crowd stares in awe. Jesse
      is frozen.

      Roger, the Fire Marshal, the band, everyone is frozen.
      Talbot stares up at Akasha, his face white, unable to
      believe his eyes. Even the Ancient Ones are stunned to
      see their Queen come to life.

      Scaffolds collapse in an EXPLOSION OF ELECTRICAL
      SPARKS... (NOTE: Practical explosion.) The Ancient
      Ones stare up into the sky as... Akasha and Lestat
      vanish. Jesse stares in horror after them.

180   EXT. DEATH VALLEY PEAK - NIGHT                                  180

      Lestat opens his eyes and finds himself high above the
      desert, the tiny lights of the concert far below.

      Lestat whirls around to suddenly see behind him Akasha in
      an extravagant Egyptian robe, its sheer cloth of gold
      draping her godly form. Lestat is awestruck. Akasha
      comes to life...

                           LESTAT
                   Akasha...

      Akasha still says nothing -- she advances with a
      luscious, curling smile.

                           AKASHA
                   Why so surprised, my love?    You
                   called, and I have come.

      Lestat is awestruck. There is such an unearthly power in
      Akasha's voice. Everything seems to hum and vibrate with
      her breath.

                           AKASHA
                   Never fear me, Lestat. Your
                   wishes have all come true.

                           LESTAT
                   My wishes...?

                                      AKASHA
                   You have yearned for a companion
                   to share eternity. You have cried
                   out to the world. I have answered
                   your call.

      Akasha spreads her arms, moving ever closer to Lestat.

                           AKASHA
                   You are so bold, like your music.
                   It woke me. You live your life in
                   the open, like I did long ago,
                   when I had a King.

                           LESTAT
                   Had a King?

                           AKASHA
                   He's no more. You are my consort.
                   I've kept you safe -- alive.

                           LESTAT
                   You?

                           AKASHA
                   You thought it was all you?
                      (laughing)
                   You have the ego of a king as
                   well. I know you, Lestat. I know
                   that you crave to have the world
                   at your feet. I have come to give
                   it to you.

      Akasha bites her own lip. Blood trickles slightly across
      her chin. Lestat stares at the blood, yearns towards it,
      as the pulse of her blood increases... Lestat looks at
      it, both wanting and fearful. Wrapping her arms around
      Lestat, she braces him, licks his face.

                           AKASHA
                   Has your tongue lost its taste for
                   blood?

                           LESTAT
                      (melting)
                   Never.

                           AKASHA
                   But you didn't kill the mortal
                   girl.

      Lestat looks caught.

                           AKASHA
                   Instead you kissed her.   Now kiss
                   me.

      (NOTE: Shoot as practical, actor against plain night
      sky, as much as possible.) Akasha rises above him,
      hovers over Lestat, letting a single drop of blood spill
      into his mouth. Lestat levitates above the ground to
      meet her as...

      Akasha hovers higher, drawing him into the sky until
      their mouths finally meet and her blood flows freely into
      him. Lestat pulls away as a great surge of power gathers
      in him and floods his body with an electric rush.

                           AKASHA
                   Be my King. Forget about
                   everything else.

      Lestat looks straight at Akasha, his face flushed.    His
      eyes are empty of everything except her blood.

                           AKASHA
                   What's your answer?

      Lestat looks at her and then smiles. Akasha's mouth
      spreads into a smile. Flashes of brilliant light strobe
      over them as Lestat moves to her, sucks again. There's a
      powerful rush of WIND that engulfs them as they spin
      together, detached from time and space.


181   FLASH CUTS - STOCK FOOTAGE                                   181

      All INTERCUT WITH Akasha's skin, her body taut and arching.
      Lestat falls back in ecstasy. He shakes out his body and
      lets out a howl of pleasure -- feels his arms, his chest,
      his groin as Akasha's blood courses through his veins.
      Akasha watches and waits. Finally Lestat grins boyishly
      through bloody teeth and wipes his lips with the back of
      his hand.

                           LESTAT
                   Can we try that again?

      Akasha smiles at him, then laughs a strange laugh, a
      kind of purr/growl. Lestat gazes at her as the sensual
      hissing seems to surround him. It is seductive and
      scary. Lestat steps up, puts a finger to her lips.

                           LESTAT
                   Show me the world...

      Akasha's mouth spreads into a smile and she yanks him up
      into the air and off into the night.


182   INT. MAHARET DESERT MANSION - NIGHT                          182

      Mael leads Jesse down the hall. She stares ahead at what
      looks like statues standing in the shadows. Her eyes
      widen as the statues come to life: Armand, Pandora,
      Khayman, Marius are talking in hushed tones, gathered
      before Maharet's "Great Family Tree." CAMERA SWEEPS
      OVER the endless lines, the rows of names that stretch
      down the stone wall -- ACROSS the floor, filling room
      after room. The Ancients all stare, deeply moved.
      Maharet turns to them.

                           MAHARET
                   We see now what Akasha means to
                   do. Rule as Queen again.
                      (pointing to the
                       great family)
                   This is why we must fight Akasha!

      Maharet looks around, determined, challenging each of the
      immortals.

                   For the sake of all mortals. She
                   must be stopped, or the mortal
                   world will end.

      The Ancients fall silent as they take this in. They gaze
      again at Maharet's Great Family, humbled for a moment by
      her life's passion.

                           MAEL
                   But is there a way?   We don't
                   know.

                           KHAYMAN
                   When she opens herself to give her
                   blood, she is vulnerable.

                           MARIUS
                   Then we weaken her. Drain her of
                   almost all her blood, but leave
                   her just one drop.

                           MAHARET
                   We can't take that chance.    We
                   must finish her.

                           ARMAND
                   If she dies, we all die.

                            PANDORA
                   We're damned no matter what
                   happens.

                              MAHARET
                   Perhaps.

      Maharet gazes at them, her mind working... Pandora,
      Khayman, Mael gaze at each other, still uncertain.

                           JESSE
                   And what about Lestat?

                           MAHARET
                   Lestat has joined with Akasha. He
                   is lost to us now. He is never
                   coming back.

                           JESSE
                   I don't believe that.

      Beaming with a possessed look, his eyes brimming with
      visions.

      Lestat opens his eyes and sees an island approaching.   In
      the distance lights sparkle as an enormous plantation
      villa is revealed, nestled into the far shore.

184   EXT. AKASHA'S PLANTATION VILLA - NIGHT                         184

      Lestat and Akasha stand on a cliff-top. WIND rips
      through the trees. Everywhere, there are torches, and a
      million candles light the vast house. Lestat and Akasha
      glide past the forest of exotic flowers... Past the
      fountains and statues -- up the steps to the open French
      doors. Long white curtains billow in the sea wind.

                        LESTAT
                Where are we?

                        AKASHA
                We are home.

                        LESTAT
                You live here?

                        AKASHA
                We live everywhere and anywhere we
                choose. The world is our garden.


185   INT. AKASHA'S PLANTATION VILLA - NIGHT                         185

      Lestat steps in through billowing curtains, stops...
      There are three West Indian girls, young, voluptuous,
      beautiful, dressed in simple working clothes and
      traditional head-wraps. They stare at Lestat, nervous,
      yet fascinated. They move towards him. Lestat finds
      himself surrounded by hands, touching him, reaching
      beneath his shirt, pulling his clothes from his body. He
      swoons, closes his eyes, smiles.

                        LESTAT
                So warm...
                   (sniffs their skin)
                ... their blood...

                        AKASHA
                ... yes...

                        LESTAT
                ... they're mortal...

                   ... of course. They serve the
                   living goddess, and her consort.
                   They find you beautiful. You are
                   a god in their eyes.

186   SERIES OF SHOTS                                                186

      ... golden dark hands pull clothes away from Lestat's
      white skin... breasts strain through white linen as they
      press themselves closer to him... the surface of water,
      scented with red rose petals. Lestat's white skin breaks
      the surface. Lestat is lowered into the bath, his skin
      alive with the dancing candles reflected in the water...
      the water laps gently -- strange sighs of pleasure as
      girls' hands caress Lestat's torso... their hands reach
      down lower and lower through the water... Lestat's eyes
      remain closed but his mouth opens... Now it's Akasha
      kissing him. Lestat responds, but his eyes sneak a peek.
      Akasha smiles -- takes his head in her hands -- she
      kisses him, pushes him back -- he tries to resist -- he
      can't, startled by her strength... Akasha kisses his
      neck, his chest, bites... Lestat arches in ecstasy...
      Akasha rises up from his breast, blood on her lips,
      smiles, goes back down and drinks.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:


187   AKASHA AND LESTAT - LATER                                      187

      now moved to the bed, surrounded by the fine nets...
      kissing, probing each other's bodies, floating above the
      bed... Akasha rolls him over -- smiles down at him -- a
      fang exposed... She draws her wrist across her mouth... a
      globule of blood smacks Lestat's open lips... Flash --
      A thousand images in a second. Lestat jolted as if by a
      million volts. Blood smears their bodies -- they bathe
      in it.


188   CLOSE ON LESTAT                                                188

      The most lascivious smile spreading over his face, even
      as the waves of pleasure still course through him,
      causing his mouth to twitch and tremble. He closes his
      eyes...

                                             FADE TO BLACK.

                                                               112.

189   SAME SCENE - LESTAT (LATER)                                     189

      opens his eyes. He sits up alone in the canopied bed,
      disoriented. Akasha is nowhere to be seen. He looks
      toward the window. The sun is just about to disappear
      below the horizon. Lestat stares, amazed, blinking...
      Shielding his eyes, Lestat goes to window, gazes in awe
      at the setting sun. As the last rays slice through the
      sky, Lestat closes his eyes, stretches his arms out, feels
      the warm sun on his skin. He smiles at this feeling he's
      craved for so long. Still smiling, he opens his eyes,
      blinking from the light. He turns, gazes towards the
      bath and gasps. The dying light illuminates... The
      servant girls' bodies, now grey with death, lying around
      the edge of the bath. The roses are now black and the
      water is colored a rich deep red...


190   INT. PLANTATION HOUSE - HALLWAY                                 190

      Lestat steps into the hallway, stares at dead bodies
      sprinkling the ground -- both servants formally dressed,
      and guests in white tropical evening dress...


191   INT. PLANTATION HOUSE - DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION         191

      The candles have all melted, forming pools that spread
      across the lace cloth. Food sits uneaten on plates. The
      last of the sun's rays strikes ten dead bodies sitting
      around the table, some slumped onto their food, some
      frozen in death. Lestat moves through the room, a
      feeling of dread spreading. We FOLLOW as he moves...


192   EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS ACTION                                  192

      ... out the French windows onto the beach, bodies of
      servants and villagers are scattered. Lestat's feet step
      down the wooden stairs, onto the sand, through the
      bodies...

      Lestat, shielding his eyes, stares up in horror at the
      pink sky.

                         AKASHA
                 Behold our Kingdom.

      Lestat sees Akasha standing further down on the beach.

                         LESTAT
                 Why?

                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                               113.

                            AKASHA
                      (puzzled)
                   Why not?

                           LESTAT
                   This is the reason you have risen?

                           AKASHA
                   They believed in nothing, now they
                   are nothing. But you and I will
                   change all that. We will give the
                   world something to believe in
                   again.

      Akasha smiles, raises her hand, suddenly slices her wrist
      with a knife. Lestat stares at her dripping blood.
      She crosses to him, her eyes locked on his. She lifts
      her wrist, drips her blood into Lestat's mouth. Lestat's
      eyes glaze over again. He smiles, feeds hungrily, lost
      again. Akasha smiles.

                           AKASHA
                   Come, my King.      We have a score to
                   settle.

      The Queen and her King swiftly fly up into the darkness.


193   INT. MAHARET'S MANSION - GRANDE HALL - NIGHT                    193

      The Ancients are still debating. Suddenly, the whole
      place begins to shake. (NOTE: Practical shadows not
      C.G.I.) A shadow passes over the Ancients' faces.

                           MARIUS
                   She comes...

      The WINDOWS along one side of the hall EXPLODE with a
      startling GUST. The Ancient Ones look up to see...
      Akasha's silhouette looming, dark and foreboding.

                           AKASHA
                   My children. It warms my blood to
                   see you all gathered... plotting
                   against me.

      They trade glances and begin to fan out around the room.

                             MAHARET
                   Akasha.

                           AKASHA
                   Maharet. You will address my
                   King first...

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                                114.

193   CONTINUED:                                                       193

      Lestat enters, his possessed eyes showing only evil now.
      Unable to help herself...

                             JESSE
                   Lestat!

      He turns slowly to the corner where she sits.      They lock
      eyes. Lestat's face stares cold and hard.

                           JESSE
                   What has she done to you?

                           LESTAT
                   Made me see.

      Taking his arm, Akasha draws Lestat to her. The Ancient
      Vampires subtly position themselves under the medieval
      weapons hanging on the walls, as Marius moves toward his
      son.

                           MARIUS
                   Lestat... step aside.

                             LESTAT
                   Never.    She is my Queen.

      Marius looks for some recognition in Lestat's eyes.
      There is none. Maharet turns to Akasha.

                           MAHARET
                   Akasha. The world has changed
                   since you reigned.

                           AKASHA
                   Then we shall change it back.
                   Humans are animals, brute
                   creatures. Their destruction can
                   only make sense.

                           MAHARET
                   We've found other ways to co-
                   exist.

                           AKASHA
                   Yes. In the shadows. In silence.
                   In shame. For what? For respect
                   of mortals? They are nothing to
                   us. They are only... food.

      She casts a dangerous eye towards Jesse. Maharet
      instinctively moves forward to protect her.

                   Poor Maharet. Still trying to
                   hold onto what I took from you.

      Maharet doesn't even flinch.

                           MARIUS
                   Akasha, please...

                           AKASHA
                      (venomous)
                   You think you can change my will?
                   I'm tired of this discussion.
                   Join me, or die.

                           MAHARET
                   I will not.

                           MARIUS
                   I will not.

                           AKASHA
                   I want to hear it from every one
                   of you. What will it be?

      Akasha scans the faces of the other Ancient Ones, staring
      deep into their souls. Akasha sees Khayman glance at the
      family tree. Akasha's eyes blaze with anger.

                           AKASHA
                   Don't tell me, you have feelings
                   for these ridiculous mortals!

      She crosses to the family tree, traces the names down to
      one. Jessica Reeves. Akasha is beyond fury, yet she
      keeps her temper under control and turns to Lestat.

                           AKASHA
                   Do you love me?

      Smiling, she bites her lip, letting a drop of blood
      glisten there, tempting Lestat.

                            LESTAT
                   Yes...

      He draws closer. Jesse stares, mortified. Akasha and
      Lestat's mouths almost meet when Akasha pulls away.
      Akasha slowly turns to Jesse.

                           AKASHA
                   Prove it. Kill her.

                           LESTAT
                   She's nothing to me.

                           AKASHA
                   Just the same, I'd like you to
                   kill her. For me.
                      (to the Ancients)
                   I've had enough of this 'great
                   family.' It's time to end it.

      Maharet steps between Lestat and Jesse.

                           MAHARET
                   You will not touch her!

      Akasha flicks her wrist. Maharet is hurled against a
      pillar, pinned by Akasha's hand.

                            AKASHA
                   You still think to challenge me,
                   Maharet?

                   I beg you, spare this child.

                           AKASHA
                   Now.

      Maharet struggles but Akasha is too strong.     Jesse gazes
      at Lestat. Then steps forward.

                           JESSE
                   It's all right, Maharet.

      Maharet stops, standing fixed with the sound of Jesse's
      newly strong and calm voice. Jesse looks to Lestat,
      straight into his dark irises, her gaze absolutely
      unwavering.

                           JESSE
                   It's what I want.   I am ready.


      She reaches up, pulls aside her shirt, revealing the top
      of her breast. A thin, red scar remains from where she
      cut herself with the silver stick from the Chinese
      barrette.

      Lestat gazes at her, begins to advance. Jesse keeps her
      gaze steady into Lestat's, risking everything.

                           AKASHA
                      (smirking)
                   How sweet...

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                                117.

      Lestat moves closer and closer to her, gazes into her
      eyes, hesitates for a moment, then continues on...

      Jesse watches him with absolute love. He reaches her.
      Maharet flies across the room, but Akasha meets her
      halfway. Grabs her by the hair. Maharet struggles but
      Akasha is much more powerful. Jesse offers up her neck
      to his bite. Maharet looks away and Akasha looks pleased
      as...

      Lestat sinks his teeth into Jesse's neck. Jesse gasps
      with the bite, but puts her arm around Lestat as he draws
      her into him, draining her of her very life-force as she
      holds him.

      With that Maharet's great family mural begins to weep
      blood from every name. All the Ancients turn, stare at
      the mural as...

      Lestat drinks and drinks and Jesse sighs with intimacy,
      clutching his neck and back, and drawing his bite deeper
      into her flesh. She slowly crumples to the floor, being
      drawn down until finally...

      Jesse lies on the floor, eyes closed and pale.    Dead.

                           AKASHA
                   Good-bye, great family.

      She turns to the MURAL with a fierce gaze. Flash! It
      EXPLODES, CRUMBLING to a million pieces on the ground.
      Maharet stares in horror.

                           AKASHA
                   Now, my children, remember your
                   real family! Or else.

      She turns to them with a killing smile.

                           LESTAT
                   But, My Queen, you've forgotten my
                   reward!

      She turns to him.

                           AKASHA
                   That's right. My King, you've
                   just earned your crown.

      Lestat smiles with a blood-stained mouth. Akasha
      approaches Lestat and offers him her vein. She looks
      scornfully at the others as he cradles her wrist...

                           AKASHA
                   You see how he obeys.    You will or
                   you will all die!

      Lestat looks once at Marius, then sinks his teeth into
      its original font. He drinks as Akasha gasps with
      pleasure at giving so much pleasure to him. She keeps
      smiling to the others. But Lestat doesn't stop drinking.
      Akasha looks back to him, her face changing.

                           AKASHA
                   That's enough, Lestat.

      Still Lestat doesn't stop.

                             AKASHA
                   Lestat.    Enough.   Stop!

      (NOTE: Scene as scripted here is quite different from
      what was analyzed in boards. Notable potential expense
      or savings indicated with brackets. [])

      But Lestat clamps down even harder.       Akasha thrashes,
      trying to release herself.

      Maharet and Marius realize what he's doing, see the
      chance Lestat has gained for them. A silent signal
      passes between them as...

      The Ancients make an instantaneous decision. Akasha
      looks up, gasping, in time to see Maharet, Marius,
      Khayman, Armand, Mael, Pandora flying towards her.
      Akasha lets out a hiss...

      Most of the Ancients are thrown to the ground while Mael
      ignites in mid-air. Mael's skin bubbles. He screams,
      the veins in his face rise up and explode as if his blood
      were burning acid...

      Pandora too bursts into flames.       She falls to the ground.

      But Lestat, strong with Akasha's blood, keeps his hold
      and Khayman, Armand, Marius, Maharet fly at her again.
      They swarm over Akasha. She rises into the air,
      thrashing about, but they hang on, forming a flying mass
      of flailing limbs.

      The THUMP of Akasha's HEART ACCELERATES as they try to
      drain her...

      Akasha turns on [Khayman to incinerate him. Flash. He
      screams as his blood boils, exploding out of his
      fingertips -- But he doesn't ignite... His wounds quickly
      heal. He moves in for another attack...]

      The Ancients are still flung around by Akasha's great
      strength, but they all hold on, as the thrashing finally
      begins to subside. The mass of bodies sinks to the
      ground. The Ancients pull back to reveal that...

      Akasha's skin is deathly blue white.    In horror, she
      manages to spit out her words.

                           AKASHA
                   You kill me, you kill yourselves.

      The Ancient Ones look to each other, uncertain a moment.

      Akasha gazes at them, then turns slowly, fixes her gaze
      on Lestat. He gazes back at her.

      Suddenly, Akasha takes her chance, rises, her eyes flare
      green, marshalling the last of her wrath. Lestat cries
      out in agony as smoke rises from his limbs.

      Fiercely determined, Lestat bites into Akasha's throat,
      this time for the kill. Akasha sinks her nails into his throat.
       He hangs on, his teeth deep. They are locked in mortal combat.
       Akasha slowly sinks to the ground, real
      fear in her eyes as her strength finally vanishes.

                           MAHARET
                   Wait, Lestat! You must stop!

      Lestat pulls away, leaving Akasha hanging in a twisted,
      unnatural angle.

      They all stare waiting to see what will happen...

      ... Maharet moves quickly. She strides over to Akasha
      and sinks her fangs into Akasha's neck. Akasha struggles
      but this time she cannot even rise up. Maharet does not
      stop. A HOWLING sound as if from hell fills the room.

      The Ancient Ones stare at Akasha, step back in awe.
      Lestat sits up, burned but still alive to see...

      Akasha's skin begins to grow horribly pale, to harden and
      cake into a chalk. There's no blood left to flow from
      the gaping holes in Akasha's flesh. She slowly begins to
      transform back to her frozen statue state. Her skin
      returning to MARBLE. CRACKS multiply, becoming fissures.
      Finally, Akasha literally falls to pieces, SMASHING on
      the stone floor like porcelain.

      A silent moment. The Ancient Ones look at each other,
      astonished, as they realize they're still "alive."

                      (whisper)
                   We survived!

      The Ancients let out relieved hisses.

      But Lestat is only concerned about Jesse. He rushes to
      her, picks up her lifeless head, takes a dagger from the
      floor and slices his wrist. He brings the open vein to
      Jesse's mouth, but she's not moving. Lestat bends down
      to her ear and whispers.

                           LESTAT
                   I left you one drop, my love.
                   Drink deep and live.

      Jesse's lips slightly move and quiver as she tastes the
      blood. She begins to take the blood inside her and then
      finally truly drink and revive as Lestat cradles her.
      She pulls away, gasping. Lestat looks into her eyes.

                           JESSE
                   I thought I'd lost you...

                           LESTAT
                   Drink, my love.

      Her lips move to his wrist. Lestat strokes her hair,
      soothes her. Jesse gasps as pain courses through her.
      Lestat holds her close. She looks up at him, their eyes
      are locked together.

                           LESTAT
                   I will never leave you again.

      He holds her tight in his arms.

      All the Ancients gaze at Lestat, now understanding what
      he did.

      Slowly Jesse rises, gazes at Lestat, her face pale, her
      eyes glowing. Then Jesse turns, stares at Maharet. All
      the Ancients turn, follow her gaze.

      A whiteness is spreading across Maharet's face and skin.
      Maharet stares at her arms and legs, slowly turning to
      stone. Jesse goes to her.

                           JESSE
                   Maharet...

                   My child, let me look at you...
                   You are finally happy. It is as
                   it should be now... I will watch
                   over you always.

      Maharet reaches out, embraces Jesse. Then Maharet sinks
      into a chair and freezes into a statue.

                           ARMAND
                      (a reverent whisper)
                   She took Akasha's last drop, took
                   Akasha's death into herself.
                   Behold, our Queen... our new
                   mother...

      The Ancients slowly bow to Maharet. Jesse slowly slips
      from Maharet's arms. Goes into Lestat's arms.

                           JESSE
                   Is she... dead?

                           KHAYMAN
                   No, she will live forever. She
                   sleeps. She sleeps, and dreams of
                   us.

      Jesse and Lestat hold onto each other, gazing at
      Maharet's face. On Maharet's lips is the most content of
      smiles. Jesse wipes away a tear.

      Marius turns to Lestat.    Their eyes meet.     Then Marius
      bows at Maharet's feet.

                           MARIUS
                   My Queen, I will watch over you
                   always.

198   BACK TO SCENE                                                198

      Talbot looks up to see Jesse and Lestat looking over his
      shoulder. He leaps out of his seat. Sees the change in
      her instantly.

                           TALBOT
                Jesse.     My God...

                David, this is Lestat.

      He looks at Lestat, fear in his eyes.

                        TALBOT
                How do you do?

                        LESTAT
                Charmed, I'm sure.

                        JESSE
                I told you I'd return with my
                findings. Here they are.

      David stares, shaken.

                        TALBOT
                But please, sit down. You'll have
                to excuse me... it's just so...
                so...

                        LESTAT
                Unexpected?

                        TALBOT
                Strangely, no...

      David looks sadly at Jesse.

                        JESSE
                Please don't be sad. I'm where I
                belong. I'm happy now.

      Lestat, content for the first time since we've known him,
      looks lovingly to Jesse. A flicker of curiosity crosses
      David's face.

                           TALBOT
                   Excuse me for asking but...

                           JESSE
                      (smiles)
                   What's it like?

                             TALBOT
                   Yes.

                           JESSE
                   Do you want to find out?

                            TALBOT
                   Me?... No. I'm too old to live
                   forever.

                           JESSE
                   Well, if you ever should change
                   your mind... Oh. I have a present
                   for you. From an old friend.

      She hands Talbot a canvas. It's a painting. He stares at
      it. The painting shows Lestat's concert. And in the
      crowd, Talbot finds Marius, now looking straight out at
      the viewer, a smile on his lips. Talbot sees standing
      beside Marius is Talbot himself, dancing with a young,
      pretty Goth. Talbot smiles.

                           JESSE
                   And Marius sent a message. You
                   were right. He doesn't go to the
                   Dorchester. But he's gonna be at
                   Claridge's later...

      Talbot stares at them.

                           JESSE
                   Well, I guess this is good-bye.

                            TALBOT
                   Yes.   Take care of her, Lestat.

                             LESTAT
                   Always.

      Talbot looks at Jesse, once his spiritual daughter.

                           TALBOT
                   Good-bye, Jesse.

      Talbot closes his eyes to shut out a tear, and Jesse is
      at his side and leans down to whisper in his ear...

                           JESSE
                   Good-bye, dear friend.

      Talbot opens his eyes to say something, but they're gone.
      Talbot turns to the painting. Stares at Marius for a
      long moment. Then stands, grabs his coat, heads for the
      door.


199   EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT                                   199

      Jesse and Lestat come out of the Talamascan headquarters.

      He takes her hand and together they float up over the
      wall and out to the street. Lestat pulls Jesse into his
      arms.

      They kiss. It's long, deep, romantic. They pull away,
      gaze sweetly, lovingly, into each other's eyes...

      And exchange happy, fanged smiles...

                           LESTAT
                   Shall we go get a drink, love?

      She smiles, nods. Lestat and Jesse take each other's
      hands, move into the crowd, zipping through the streets
      at that STRANGE preternatural SPEED...

      ... and vanish into the night.

                                             FADE OUT.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          FLAMES fill the SCREEN. Then: the gentle voice of an
          OLD WOMAN, barely more than a whisper...

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          I am a common woman. I was born
          in a common cottage in a common
          village. My life would likely be
          no different from yours, were it
          not for the most uncommon events
          that occurred during the winter of
          the Year of Our Lord Thirteen
          Hundred and Twenty-five. I
          learned many things that winter.
          About people. About love. But
          mainly, I learned about loss.
          A MAN tosses a piece of wood into the flames, which turns
          out to be a LARGE CAMPFIRE.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          To this day, I am the only person
          that I know to be living who knows
          the whole truth about that
          horrible time. This is my tale.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing THREE KNIGHTS, beleaguered,
          scarred, returning from the Crusades. Their armor is in
          disarray, adorned with souvenirs from the Middle East.
          They're camped in a clearing, their cart pulled to a
          nearby roadside. LIGHTNING flashes in the distance.
          One of them, a TEENAGE BOY who looks like his sword might
          weigh more than he does, hitches a nervous HORSE to a
          tree. He strokes the horse's neck, calming.
          Then: A WOLF HOWLS in the distance. The Boy suddenly
          looks nervous, too. He quickly joins the others at the
          campfire -- a FAT KNIGHT (30s) and an OLD KNIGHT.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          Did you hear that?

                         FAT KNIGHT
          Hear what?
          The wolf HOWLS AGAIN. The Boy shivers, fearful.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          The innkeeper told me --

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         CONTINUED:

                         FAT KNIGHT
          I know what he told you. He told
          you about the Wolf. The Beast of
          Villiers la CroisÃ©e.
          (off Boy's look)
          The people of that village have
          been spreading that nonsense since
          before you were a tickle in your
          daddy's prick. I'd give you a
          whipping for believing it if I
          thought it would do any good.
          The Old Knight stares into the fire, then speaks.

                         OLD KNIGHT
          I used to travel these woods.
          They told the same stories then
          that they do now. Only I heard
          them from a man who actually saw
          the beast with his own eyes.

                         FAT KNIGHT
          Half the people in these parts
          claim to have seen it.

                         OLD KNIGHT
          This man claimed it was the last
          thing he ever saw. The Wolf took
          his eyes. And half his face.
          (off their looks)
          I saw his scars and empty eye
          sockets. His skin looked like it
          was on inside-out. It didn't seem
          to me like the kind of thing a man
          would make up a story about.
          He shrugs. His companions exchange an unnerved look.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (LATER)

          It's raining now. The Knights sleep underneath the cart
          for shelter. Lightning FLASHES.
          Then, from O.S., the horse gives a series of frightened
          NEIGHS. The Boy stirs, but by the time he awakens, there
          is only the sound of the RAIN. Did he imagine it? He
          reluctantly decides to venture out to investigate.
          The Boy hurries over to where he tied the horse... but
          all he finds is the empty rope blowing in the wind. In a
          FLASH of lightning, he sees that the horse is gone.
          Then he hears something. A strange GNAWING sound.
          TEARING and POPPING. He slowly turns...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         CONTINUED:
          Not far away, he makes out a shape in the darkness. The
          horse is on its side, WHEEZING helplessly. And there's
          something crouched next to it. We can't make out what it
          is, only a MAN-LIKE SHAPE, shrouded in shadow.
          Whatever it is, it's eating the horse alive.
          The Boy steps away in horror, then hurriedly stumbles
          back to his companions and frantically shakes them awake.

                         FAT KNIGHT
          What the devil are you --?!

                         TEENAGE BOY
          Wait, wait! Be quiet!
          He raises a hand. He's heard something. They listen.
          FOOTSTEPS. Approaching through the mud. The Boy's hand
          clutches a dagger, but the Fat Knight reaches out and
          stays him, terrified. The Boy follows his look.
          We never get a good look at THE FIGURE walking toward
          them. But what the men see scares them shitless. It
          stops near the cart. The men huddle together, watching
          as it slowly starts to walk around the cart --
          -- then suddenly jumps atop it. The Figure is now above
          them. With each step it takes, the boards of the wooden
          cart CREAK and bend under its weight. A long beat.
          Then the Figure jumps down again, landing behind the men,
          startling them. It pauses. The men cower, shivering...
          Suddenly, the cart is flipped over as if it weighed
          nothing, revealing the terrified Knights beneath it.
          Lightning FLASHES. A shadow falls over them.
          The men scramble to their feet, but the Old Knight slips
          in the mud. The Boy stops to help him, but then the Old
          Knight starts screaming, something GROWLS, and the Boy
          stops short at what he sees. The Fat Knight runs.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          Wait! We have to help him!
          The Fat Knight ignores him. The Old Knight shrieks. We
          hear the same TEARING and POPPING that this thing made
          while eating the horse. The Boy quickly looks around...
          ... sees a curved Arabian scimitar lying in the mud,
          fallen from the overturned wagon. He grabs it and as the
          Fat Knight runs, the Boy stands his ground. He hefts the
          blade. He's young, but he has used this before. A lot.
          Rain beats down on his face and lightning FLASHES as he
          confronts the thing that is devouring the Old Knight.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          The Fat Knight runs through the forest without looking
          back. He hears a loud HOWL behind him and runs faster.
          Then he hears the Boy SCREAMING and blind panic sets in,
          his head filled with the sounds of his HEAVY BREATHING
          and RUNNING FOOTFALLS in the mud and crashing THUNDER.
          He's running so fast he nearly falls into the RUSHING
          RIVER that crosses his path. He quickly looks for a way
          to cross. The river is gorged and the water is moving
          fast. Then, in a flash of lightning, he spots it --
          A fallen tree spans the river. The Knight hurries to it.
          The bark is smooth and slick from the rain. He can't
          stand on it. He has to crawl. He edges out on his hands
          and knees, his eyes flicking nervously at the waters
          surging underneath him. He has almost made it across...
          ... when he hears a LOW SNARL. He freezes. Looks back.
          Lightning FLASHES. The Figure, still obscured to us,
          stands on the riverbank behind the Knight. It GROWLS.
          The Knight tries to crawl away, but slips and nearly
          falls in the river. Then suddenly, the tree beneath him
          begins to move. He hangs on for his life and looks back.
          The Figure is on the tree behind him, slowly closing in.
          He starts to crawl, slips again. No way he can get away.
          He looks down into the racing river waters. Then back at
          the Figure closing in. The choice is clear. The Fat
          Knight dives headfirst off the tree --
          -- but he never hits the water. Something grabs him by
          the legs and stops him short. He cries out and looks up
          at the thing that is dangling him helplessly above the
          water. He weeps. Then, abruptly --
          -- he is yanked up out of sight.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          A BUTCHER quickly and expertly cuts the throat of a pig
          that has been hung upside down by its hind legs. It
          kicks and squirms as it bleeds out into a pan.
          VILLAGERS bustle along a muddy road. A MERCHANT sells
          his wares. Dogs run and BARK. A DISHEVELLED MAN locked
          up in the stockade. A BLACKSMITH's hammer CLANGS.
          On the surface, a typical medieval village. But
          something is wrong here. A pall hangs over the place.
          The people are subdued, beaten. A TITLE comes up:

                         FRANCE

                         1324

          5.

                         CONTINUED:
          There's a SIGN in the village green. Hanging from it is
          a wood plank with a crude drawing of a moon on it, three-
          quarters full. The moon has a vaguely sinister face...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY

          A tiny spider spins its web. CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to a
          pretty 17-year-old GIRL gazing up at it. Her name is
          ISABELLE. She scoops the spider up, watches it crawl
          around on her hand, fascinated.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          The home of a medieval peasant. Isabelle's mother,
          SUZETTE (late 30s), and sister, LUCIE (18, plain-
          looking), work in the garden. They look up as Isabelle
          emerges from the cottage, daintily carrying the spider.

                         LUCIE
          Honestly, Isabelle. Just kill it.

                         ISABELLE
          I can't. It's the fifth
          commandment. Thou shalt not kill.
          Lucie rolls her eyes. Isabelle crouches, letting the
          spider crawl off her hand. She watches it skitter away,
          then calls to Suzette, feigning nonchalance:

                         ISABELLE
          I'm going to take Father some
          water.

                         SUZETTE
          All right. Don't be long.
          Isabelle smiles, grabs a bucket and ladle, and anxiously
          heads toward the village. Lucie watches her go, dubious.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          Isabelle struggles to draw water from a well. Even
          toiling and sweaty, Isabelle's beauty stands in stark
          contrast to her squalid surroundings.
          A CARPENTER building a timber-framed structure notices
          his TWO YOUNG APPRENTICES (late teens) casting distracted
          glances in her direction. He calls out to her, smiling.

                         CARPENTER
          Hey, there! Let one of these
          young lads get that for you.

                         ISABELLE
          I can do it myself.
          The Carpenter smiles. Of course she can.

          EXT. NEW FIELD - DAY

          The village WOODCUTTERS are chopping down trees and
          hauling away the lumber. A GROUP of them are in the
          midst of what looks like a serious conversation.
          Isabelle approaches them with the bucket of water. One
          of them turns and sees Isabelle. His name is CESAIRE
          (handsome, 40s). He hides his dour expression and gives
          Isabelle a big smile. She smiles back.

                         ISABELLE
          Mother thought you might be
          thirsty.

                         CESAIRE
          That was very thoughtful of her.
          He gives her a knowing look as he ladles a drink from the
          bucket. Isabelle's gaze drifts from him to another
          woodcutter, working off by himself. His name is PETER
          (21, darkly handsome, almost dangerous-looking).
          He makes eye contact with Isabelle for a moment, then
          wipes his brow and calls out to the WOODCUTTER BOSS.

                         PETER
          I'm taking a break.

                         WOODCUTTER BOSS
          A break? Does that mean you're
          going to start working?
          The other Woodcutters LAUGH. Peter walks away.
          Isabelle's gaze lingers on him too long. Cesaire
          notices, not entirely comfortable with what he sees...

          EXT. WOODS - PATH - DAY

          Not far from where the Woodcutters work, Peter waits,
          impatient. Soon Isabelle approaches, smiling. He takes
          her in his arms, kissing her. She holds him tight.

                         PETER
          I was afraid you weren't coming.

                         ISABELLE
          You should know better than that.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         CONTINUED:
          He kisses her again, nibbling her neck. Isabelle opens
          her eyes, smiles up at him. Touches his face.

                         ISABELLE
          I think my sister's starting to
          suspect something.

                         PETER
          Do you think she'll tell your
          father?

                         ISABELLE
          I don't care. I wish she would
          tell him. I want everyone to
          know. Besides, my father likes
          you.

                         PETER
          Of course he does. Right up until
          the point where he figures out
          what I'm doing with his daughter.
          Peter glances back and Isabelle follows his look.
          Through the trees, she sees her father and the group of
          grim Woodcutters, still in serious conversation.

                         ISABELLE
          What's going on?

                         PETER
          You haven't heard?
          (off her look)
          Three men. They found them this
          morning just off the Center Road.
          At least they think it was three
          men. There wasn't enough left to
          piece them back together.
          A long beat as Isabelle takes this in. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          Was it the Wolf?

                         PETER
          Could it have been anything else?
          Isabelle shudders. No, it couldn't have been.

                         PETER
          We should have killed that monster
          a long time ago.

                         ISABELLE

          He gives her a grim smile, then kisses her. She kisses
          him back, then tries to stop kissing him. It's not easy.

                         ISABELLE
          I'd better go.

                         PETER
          Same time tomorrow?

                         ISABELLE
          Don't get used to this. I start
          my sewing lessons next week.

                         PETER
          You really think you can go all
          day without seeing me?

                         ISABELLE
          I'll manage somehow. Pride is a
          cardinal sin, by the way.

                         PETER
          I can think of worse sins I could
          be committing.
          She gives a cautioning look, then leaves with a smile.

          The VILLAGE HERALD is changing the plank on the moon
          sign. He replaces the picture of the three-quarters moon
          with a picture of a half moon, its face indifferent.

          Isabelle pulls on a drab hooded cloak.

                         SUZETTE
          You mind your grandmother,
          understand? You're her student
          now, the same as the other girls.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, Mother.
          Suzette hands her the basket with a proud look.

                         SUZETTE
          My last baby has grown up.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - MORNING

          Isabelle watches a DEAF BOY perform simple sleight of
          hand magic tricks. His name is CLAUDE (14). She
          applauds his performance and hands him a coin. He makes
          it 'disappear,' then smiles big and runs away.
          A crazy old woman, LUCRECE, shoots Isabelle a look.

                         LUCRECE
          You're only encouraging him.

                         ISABELLE
          I know.
          THREE GIRLS (ages 16-18) approach: ROXANNE (round-faced,
          cheery and instantly likable), PRUDENCE (practical,
          serious), and ROSEMARIA (pretty, arrogant, flirtatious).
          A playful PUPPY tags along. Prudence and Rosemaria look
          tired, but Roxanne greets Isabelle with a big smile.

                         ISABELLE
          You look happy.

                         ROXANNE
          Aren't you excited?

                         PRUDENCE
          It's too early to be excited.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm just trying to look on the
          bright side.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Well, stop it before somebody
          hurts you.
          The girls have a laugh at Roxanne's expense.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - MORNING

          The girls leave the village on a trail that leads through
          the dark forest. The puppy stops at the edge of the
          forest. Then it WHINES and refuses to follow.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - MORNING

          The trail stretches out in front of the girls as far as
          they can see. Rosemaria walks with Roxanne. Prudence
          hangs back with Isabelle, brimming with juicy gossip.

          Did you hear about her and the
          Darley brothers?

                         ISABELLE
          Oh, no! Which one?

                         PRUDENCE
          Both! On the same night!
          Isabelle gives an incredulous look and Prudence tries to
          contain her laughter. Rosemaria hears and looks back at
          them. She scowls at Isabelle.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Why does your grandmother have to
          live so far away?

                         ISABELLE
          What's the matter, Rosemaria?
          Having trouble walking?
          Prudence laughs. Roxanne frowns, disapproving.
          Rosemaria shoots Isabelle a dirty look.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          The girls cross a little wooden bridge that spans a
          BABBLING brook and follow the trail to a large cottage,
          well past its prime. Chickens CLUCK and peck around it.
          An OLD WOMAN opens the door and waves to them. She's
          stooped and withered, but her eyes are bright and
          beautiful. She wears a blue belted gown and a necklace
          with a crucifix on it. This is Isabelle's GRANDMOTHER.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Well, stop dawdling. Come on,
          come on.
          The girls hurry inside, but Grandmother stops Isabelle.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Your mother has warned you not to
          expect any special treatment from
          me?

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, ma'am.
          Grandmother eyes her a moment longer, then breaks into a
          smile and surreptitiously hands her a bright red apple.

          Well, then your mother doesn't
          know me very well, does she?
          Isabelle smiles as Grandmother ushers her inside.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Grandmother works a pair of knitting needles, casting
          loops of red wool yarn onto one of them, a BLACK CAT
          resting on her lap. Her bedchamber is hidden by a
          beautiful veil embroidered with palms and pomegranates.
          The girls sit facing her, watching as she knits. Then:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          There. This is going to be my
          foundation. Everything I do now
          will build off of this.
          She shows the row of stitches to Roxanne.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Roxanne, is this a good
          foundation?

                         ROXANNE
          I don't know.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Why not?

                         ROXANNE
          Well... you haven't told us what
          you're making.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          There's something else I haven't
          told you. I haven't told you why
          I'm making it. Before you begin
          any task, you must first always
          ask yourself why.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Why?
          The girls laugh. Grandmother gives her a patient smile.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Because understanding why you are
          doing something is the key to
          doing it successfully. So, before
          we begin today, let's be certain
          that we have a good foundation.
          Who can tell me why you are here?

          To become seamstresses. To learn
          how to sew and mend clothes.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          That's what you are doing. But
          why are you doing it?
          Blank looks. None of them have ever considered this.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Isabelle, your sister studied with
          me last winter. What does she do
          now?

                         ISABELLE
          She works with the women.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Why don't you work with them?

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know how to yet.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          And how does that make you feel?
          Isabelle thinks for a moment, then has an insight.

                         ISABELLE
          Like a child.
          Grandmother gives her a smile, then continues.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You will be coming here every day
          for the next three months. During
          that time, I will teach you
          everything you need to know to be
          productive members of our
          community. But there is something
          far more important that will also
          be happening here.
          All the girls are paying close attention now, but
          Grandmother seems to be speaking directly to Isabelle.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You will be proving your worth and
          learning your place in the world.
          And I promise you, when you leave
          here for the last time, you will
          never feel like a child again.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - DUSK

          The four girls return to the village along the forest
          path. Waiting for them is Peter. Isabelle pretends to
          not notice him. As they pass, he calls out to her:

                         PETER
          I need to talk to you.
          Isabelle turns to face him, trying to stay nonchalant.

                         ISABELLE
          What about?
          Peter just looks at her for a beat. Isabelle turns and
          sees that the other girls have stopped to watch.
          Isabelle shoots them a look. The girls take the hint and
          leave. When they've gone, Peter walks up to Isabelle.

                         PETER
          When were you planning on telling
          me?

                         ISABELLE
          Telling you what?

                         PETER
          That you're engaged to be married
          to Henri Smith.
          Isabelle gapes at him, stunned and confused.

                         ISABELLE
          Henri Smith? Is this a joke?

                         PETER
          Look at me. Just look at me and
          tell me you didn't know.
          She looks at him and sees it in his eyes. He's serious.

                         ISABELLE
          Who told you this?

                         PETER
          Your father.
          Off Isabelle's look...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

          The family is gathered around the table. Isabelle and

          It's all been arranged. Your
          marriage to Henri will settle our
          debt to his father.
          Isabelle nods, shaken. Cesaire sees that she's upset.

                         SUZETTE
          We know that you and Peter have
          become friends. But you have
          adult responsibilities now. That
          means putting your family's
          interests ahead of your own.

                         ISABELLE
          So Henri Smith is in the family's
          interest and Peter is not?

                         CESAIRE
          Peter is a fine young man.

                         ISABELLE
          But what? He's poor? He's an
          orphan?

                         SUZETTE
          He's not one of us. His parents
          were outsiders.

                         ISABELLE
          Why? Because they hadn't lived
          here since Noah built the ark?

                         SUZETTE
          You mind your tongue.
          Isabelle is about to respond, when she notices something.
          Lucie is crying. A beat. Lucie looks up at her parents.

                         LUCIE
          Do you realize how this makes me
          look? I'm older than her by more
          than a year. If anyone should be
          getting married in the spring,
          it's me.
          Everyone is taken aback. Lucie storms out of the
          cottage, angrily wiping tears. Isabelle watches her go.

          both of them hating me.
          In the loft, Isabelle and Lucie are in bed... but
          Isabelle only pretends to be asleep so she can eavesdrop.

                         SUZETTE
          We knew Isabelle was going to be
          stubborn. It wouldn't be like her
          to simply do as she's told. She's
          too much like her grandmother.

                         CESAIRE
          That she is. What about Lucie?

                         SUZETTE
          She's a good girl, but she's still
          a child. Talk to her. You're her
          father. She'll listen to you.
          Isabelle glances over at Lucie... and sees that she's
          been eavesdropping, too. Lucie turns away, embarrassed.
          Isabelle gives her a sad look.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          There's a knock at the door. Isabelle answers, revealing
          HENRI (18). He's tall and good-looking, but still
          awkward in his body. Isabelle eyes him, a little aloof.

                         HENRI
          Hello, Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE

          So I suppose you've heard.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes. My parents are very pleased.

                         HENRI
          And you? Are you pleased?

                         ISABELLE

          Do you have any other feelings
          about it? About me?

                         ISABELLE
          I'm not sure. We've never really
          talked that much.

                         HENRI
          I know. That's why I asked you to
          walk with me. I wanted to talk.

                         ISABELLE
          What for?

                         HENRI
          Well... because we're going to be
          husband and wife soon.

                         ISABELLE
          Not until the spring festival.
          That's months away. A lot can
          happen in a few months.
          Henri seems disappointed. She sees this and reconsiders.

                         ISABELLE
          All right. What would you like to
          talk about?

                         HENRI
          I'm not really sure. I brought
          you this.
          He reaches into his pocket and offers Isabelle a flower.
          She takes it, suddenly blushing. But just then, she sees
          Peter walking toward them with another WOODCUTTER.

                         ISABELLE
          Well, I'm glad we had this
          conversation.
          Isabelle abruptly turns and walks away, leaving Henri
          surprised and a little hurt. She passes Peter, her eyes
          averted. He glances back at her as she and walks away...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle is helping Suzette prepare dinner, but she's
          purposefully ignoring her mother. Suzette notices.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SUZETTE
          You know, I had a sweetheart when
          I was your age, too.
          Isabelle looks up, intrigued in spite of herself.
          Suzette smiles slyly at her reaction.

                         ISABELLE
          What happened?

                         SUZETTE
          Nothing happened. My parents
          arranged for me to marry your
          father and that was the end of
          that.

                         ISABELLE
          Didn't you want to marry your
          sweetheart?

                         SUZETTE
          Of course, I did. But there's
          more to marriage than being in
          love. Love doesn't always last
          and it certainly doesn't fill your
          children's bellies in the winter.

                         ISABELLE
          You've never wished you could have
          married that other boy?

                         SUZETTE
          Not even once.
          Isabelle eyes her, still uncertain.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Isabelle prays in front of an altar with prayer candles
          on it. Peter kneels next to her and lights one of them.

                         PETER
          We need to talk.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          Isabelle and Peter stand behind the church, out of sight.
          Peter looks off toward the woods, his back to Isabelle.

                         PETER
          You have to go through with it.
          You have to marry Henri.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle takes a step toward him. She hesitates,
          gathering her nerve to speak. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          I don't care what my parents want.
          They don't own me. I love you.

                         PETER
          That doesn't matter.

                         ISABELLE
          It does to me. Doesn't it matter
          to you?

                         PETER
          It's not our decision to make.

                         ISABELLE
          You sound like my mother.

                         PETER
          Then maybe you should start
          listening to your mother.
          (off her look)
          It's over. They had to find out
          eventually. Don't turn this into
          something that it's not. We had
          our fun, but that's all it ever
          was.
          Isabelle looks up at him, shocked and confused.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't believe you.

                         PETER
          Go home, Isabelle. Go home and
          grow up.
          Isabelle gapes at him. Peter walks away.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't believe you!
          He doesn't look back. She watches him go, heartbroken.

          EXT. CREEK - DAWN

          Cesaire bathes in a cold stream. The sun is just barely
          rising, rays of light shining through the trees. He
          smiles. It looks like the start of a beautiful day.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The village is bustling with activity, but there's a
          palpable tension. The picture on the moon sign is of a
          three-quarters moon... but then the Herald changes it to
          a picture of a FULL MOON with a cruel, malevolent face.

                         HERALD
          Full moon! Full moon! Full moon!

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - MORNING

          Isabelle emerges from the cottage. Roxanne, Prudence,
          and Rosemaria are outside waiting on her. They all start
          toward the village, but then Isabelle sees something...
          In the shadows next to the cottage, Cesaire is giving
          Lucie a stern lecture. Lucie turns and sees Isabelle.
          Her face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes.
          Isabelle starts toward them, but Cesaire stops her.

                         CESAIRE
          This doesn't concern you,
          Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, Father.
          Isabelle reluctantly turns and walks away. The girls
          follow her. Roxanne gives Lucie a concerned look.

          EXT. VILLAGE - MORNING

          The girls walk through the village. Isabelle is lost in
          thought, stung by her father's brusk dismissal.

                         ROXANNE
          What's wrong with Lucie?

                         ROSEMARIA
          How would you feel if you were in
          love with your sister's fiancÃ©e?
          Isabelle stops short and gives Rosemaria a sharp look.

                         ISABELLE
          Lucie is not in love with my
          fiancÃ©e.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Really? So she's just had a crush
          on him since she was ten?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          As if she would really tell you
          something like that.

                         ROSEMARIA
          She didn't. She told my sister.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          Did you honestly not know?
          Isabelle clearly had no idea, but tries to hide it. Just
          then, they walk by the blacksmith's shop where Henri
          works with his father, ADRIEN. Henri smiles at Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Come on. We're going to be late.
          She turns away. Rosemaria gives her a smug look.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAWN

          The girls are walking down the path to Grandmother's
          cottage. Rosemaria lags behind, tired and grumpy.
          There's a fork in the path and Rosemaria stops at it. A
          SMALLER PATH branches off into the forest, overgrown and
          narrow. Rosemaria looks at it for a beat...
          Roxanne suddenly notices that Rosemaria isn't with them.
          She looks back and sees her start down the other path.

                         ROXANNE
          Rosemaria...?
          The other girls stop and hurry back to the fork, dismayed
          to find Rosemaria headed down the overgrown path.

                         ISABELLE
          What are you doing?

                         ROSEMARIA
          What does it look like?

                         ISABELLE
          You can't go that way. You have
          to stay on the path.

                         ROSEMARIA
          This way is faster.

                         PRUDENCE
          But it's not safe. My brother
          says the bridge is rotten.

          21.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ROSEMARIA
          I don't care. It's bad enough
          working all day in that smelly
          cottage. It's not reasonable for
          them to expect us to walk that far
          every day on top of that.
          She walks away, defiant. The girls look nervous. Then:

                         PRUDENCE
          If you get lost, nobody will come
          looking for you. Not tonight.
          This last part gives Rosemaria pause. She looks down the
          narrow path. It suddenly seems a little ominous.
          Grudgingly, she returns to the group. The other girls
          exchange quiet looks of relief. They continue on.
          The wind blows leaves across the abandoned path...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          The girls are busy with sewing and knitting projects.
          Grandmother helps Roxanne at the spinning wheel. Then:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Everyone finish what you're
          working on. Your parents will be
          worried if you're not home before
          it starts to get dark.
          The girls begin packing up their work. Prudence sighs.

                         PRUDENCE
          I wish someone would just kill
          that stupid wolf.

                         ROXANNE
          You can't just kill it. It's not
          an ordinary wolf. It's a devil-
          wolf. A servant of Satan himself.
          Prudence rolls her eyes. Whatever.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Who cares what it is? It's only
          one night a month. You stay
          inside, lock up the animals, and
          you don't go into the forest.
          It's never killed anyone from the
          village and as long as we leave it
          alone, it never will.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         CONTINUED:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          My goodness. I had no idea our
          young people were so woefully
          uneducated these days.
          (off their looks)
          Our village was not always like
          this. When I was young, this was
          a very special place. Traders and
          merchants came here from lands I'd
          never heard of selling things I
          had never seen. King Philip the
          Bold even visited here once. But
          that, of course, was before the
          Wolf came.
          The girls listen attentively.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Your parents fear the Wolf because
          they remember when it did kill
          people from the village. Break
          down doors in the middle of the
          night and snatch children right
          out of their beds. Rumors began
          to spread that we were cursed.
          That was when our village began to
          die. And that was why my husband
          led a group of men into the woods
          to kill the Wolf. But instead, it
          killed him.
          Isabelle reacts. She has never heard this story before.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          After that, people here didn't
          have much stomach to go hunting
          for it anymore. But something had
          changed. The Wolf stopped killing
          in the village. Even our
          livestock were usually safe as
          long as they were brought inside.
          So we decided it was safer to
          compromise. We gave the Wolf its
          one night a month, the night of
          the full moon, and it has left us
          alone ever since.

                         ISABELLE
          People still die.

                         ROSEMARIA
          Yes, but nobody we know.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Everyone knows what should be
          done. But it's not always easy to
          do what you know is right.
          Sometimes it's easier to settle
          for being safe.
          Isabelle frowns, unsatisfied.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY

          Villagers hurriedly bring their sheep and pigs into their
          homes. Doors are shut and barricaded. Cesaire is
          outside the family cottage, nailing the shutters closed.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle's family sits at the dinner table in silence.
          Cesaire sets mugs of beer out for everyone. Lucie numbly
          picks at her food, doesn't touch her beer. Isabelle
          works up her nerve to say something and turns to Suzette:

                         ISABELLE
          You were right. About Peter. I
          was being childish.

                         (BEAT)
          But I'm not going to marry Henri.
          Cesaire and Suzette stop eating. Suzette levels a cold
          look at Isabelle.

                         SUZETTE
          You'll do as you're told. It's
          all been arranged.

                         ISABELLE
          The family gains the same no
          matter which one of us marries
          him. And I don't love Henri.
          Lucie does.
          Lucie looks up, surprised to be dragged into this.

                         ISABELLE
          She's right. It's not fair. I
          will gladly trade places with her.
          A beat. Then, without looking up, Lucie whispers:

                         LUCIE
          Shut up.
          Isabelle is stung, the smile wiped from her face.

          I'm sorry... I...

                         LUCIE
          Please. Just shut up and mind
          your own business.
          A tense beat. Isabelle looks away, hurt and confused.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT

          Isabelle is fast asleep. Next to her, Lucie looks over
          at her. She's wide awake. She sneaks out of bed...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Lucie carefully sneaks down from the loft and quietly
          puts on a RED RIDING HOOD. She accidently kicks a pan on
          the floor and puts a hand down to silence it. She
          listens to hear if anyone has awakened. Nothing.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Lucie slips out of the house. She shivers in the cold,
          pulls the riding hood around her. FULL MOON in the sky.
          The village looks deserted, a ghost town. Eerie, still,
          dark. The moon-sign swings in the breeze, CREAKING on
          its rusty hooks. Lucie hurries away toward the woods...

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          Lucie nervously walks along the road leading away from
          the village. She startles at every sound. She looks up.
          The full moon is visible in the sky above her through the
          skeletal branches of the dark trees...
          She comes to the overgrown path that the girls stopped at
          earlier. Lucie takes a deep breath and starts down it...

          EXT. GULLY - NIGHT

          Lucie reaches an OLD ROPE BRIDGE. It spans a deep gully
          and a fast-moving river strewn with jagged rocks. Lucie
          gives the bridge a nervous look and starts across it...
          The boards CREAK loudly under her feet. The bridge sways
          in the wind. She carefully makes her way across, only
          breathing when she is safely on the other side.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

          EXT. WOODS - CLEARING - NIGHT

          Lucie comes to a grassy meadow bathed with moonlight.
          She stands in the middle of it, next to a large rock, and
          looks all around. She's alone, cold and afraid. Then...
          ... she takes off her riding hood, folds it, and places
          it on the rock. She begins to disrobe, folding her dress
          and her undergarments and stacking them in a neat pile.
          Soon she's standing naked, her arms clutched around her
          breasts, shivering with cold. And fear.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK from this lonely naked figure until the
          dark branches of the trees obscure her from view. Then,
          somewhere, a WOLF HOWLS in the night...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAWN

          Isabelle wakes up, groggy. Lucie's bed is empty.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY

          Children are playing, a BOY chasing several giggling
          GIRLS, growling and waving his hands like claws.

                         BOY
          I'm the Wolf! I'm going to eat
          you up!

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

          One of the Girls runs into the meadow and sees something
          that makes her stop short. The other Children gather
          behind her, all frozen by what they see...
          CROWS are picking at a bloody carcass. All we can see of
          it is a human hand. A crow gnaws on one of the fingers.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          The girls are at their lessons. Suddenly, there's an
          urgent KNOCK at the door. Everyone stops, surprised.
          Grandmother answers it. It's a YOUNG MAN, sweaty and out
          of breath from running.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          What on earth --?
          The Young Man glances at Isabelle. Something about the
          look in his eyes makes Isabelle go pale...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - DAY

          Isabelle hurries into the clearing with Roxanne,
          Prudence, and Rosemaria trailing behind her. A crowd has
          gathered. She pushes through it, then stop short.
          Lucie is dead. We don't see what's been done to her, but
          Roxanne turns away and vomits. Cesaire and Suzette are
          already here. He holds her as she cries on his shoulder.
          Isabelle just stares at Lucie's body, shattered.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle is curled in a fetal ball on the bed, clutching
          Lucie's cloak to her chest. She's cried her eyes out.
          Grandmother sets down a cup of tea. As Isabelle watches,
          Grandmother sprinkles a pinch of dark herbs in the tea.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          It's my little secret. A pinch
          will help you rest. A little more
          and you'll sleep through the end
          of the world.
          Grandmother smiles. Isabelle smiles back, weak.

                         ISABELLE
          I think I'd like that.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

          Two men, the Merchant and the REEVE, gossip by the well.

                         MERCHANT
          She had it coming, if you ask me.
          What the hell was she doing out
          there?
          Then they notice that Isabelle is right behind them,
          drawing a water from the well. Both men shift
          uncomfortably, but she pretends she didn't hear.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          Lucie's body lies on the table. Isabelle watches as
          Suzette and Grandmother bathe the body. Suddenly,
          Grandmother stops. She's found something clutched in
          Lucie's hand. A troubled look comes over her...

                         ISABELLE
          What is it?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Nothing.
          Grandmother curtly wraps what she's found in a washcloth.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Lucie's funeral. Cesaire and Suzette sit with Isabelle,
          who holds Grandmother's hand. The other girls are here,
          too. Roxanne sits with her mother, MARGUERITE, and
          Claude, the deaf boy we saw performing magic. The
          priest, FATHER AUGUSTE, conducts the service.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          Wherefore each man and woman that
          is wise, make him ready thereto;
          for we all shall die, and we know
          not how soon...

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          Villagers leave the church. Claude is playing in the
          cemetery. Father Auguste frowns, disapproving.
          Marguerite sees this and angrily pulls Roxanne aside.

                         MARGUERITE
          Take your brother home.
          Embarrassed, Roxanne quickly grabs Claude and drags him
          away, but he fights her, crying and kicking.
          Isabelle's family is met by Henri and his father, Adrien.

                         ADRIEN
          She was a good girl. We all loved
          her.
          He's looking at Cesaire and shakes his hand, but he
          briefly glances at Suzette. Isabelle notices the look,
          but then she spots Peter leaving the church. She makes
          brief eye contact with him before Henri interrupts.

                         HENRI
          I'm here for you, too.
          But her gaze follows Peter as he walks away...

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

          ATTEWATER, the town bailiff, presides over a gathering of
          the Villagers. Isabelle, Suzette, and Grandmother sit
          with Cesaire, who is angrily addressing the crowded room.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         CONTINUED:

                         CESAIRE
          A line has been crossed. The
          beast must be destroyed!

                         MERCHANT
          Your daughter crossed the line.
          She went into the woods.

                         CESAIRE
          She was taken. She must have
          been!

                         MERCHANT
          So the Wolf broke into your home
          and stole your daughter without
          waking anyone or leaving any sign
          at all?

                         REEVE
          It's been almost thirty years
          since someone here was killed by
          the Wolf. We've left it alone.
          Why would it suddenly come and
          take one of us now?
          Grandmother gathers her nerve and stands up.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I know something.
          Cesaire and Suzette give Grandmother surprised looks.
          She walks up to the table and hands Attewater the wadded
          up washcloth we saw her with earlier.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I found this. I believe it must
          belong to her attacker.
          Attewater unfolds the washcloth. There are a few strands
          of hair inside. He gives her a sharp look.

                         ATTEWATER
          This is not animal hair.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          No, it isn't. It's human.
          A stunned silence comes over the room.

                         ATTEWATER
          No man could have done the things
          that were done to your
          granddaughter. It must have been
          the Wolf.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Yet she was holding a man's hair
          in her hand when she died.

                         ATTEWATER
          What are you suggesting?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          That the man and the Wolf may be
          one and the same.
          A low MURMUR works its way through the crowd.

                         ATTEWATER
          A werewolf.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          It would explain much. The Pope
          himself has declared that such
          creatures exist.
          The thought gives everyone pause.

                         MERCHANT
          Even if you're right, it doesn't
          help us. The woods are filled
          with hermits and strangers. If
          there's a werewolf among them, how
          will we find it?

                         ATTEWATER
          There are experts in these
          matters. Men who find and try
          witches and werewolves. We could
          request the Church to send
          someone.
          Grandmother gives him a sharp look.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Not someone. You're talking about
          Father Solomon.
          This sends a ripple of comment through the room.

                         ATTEWATER
          He is the Church's most successful
          werewolf hunter.

                         ADRIEN
          But what of his methods? The man
          once burned down an entire village
          just to root out one witch.

          30.

                         CONTINUED: (3)

                         ATTEWATER
          Unsubstantiated rumors. The
          Church has appointed him the
          Witchfinder General of all
          Christendom.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          That is also unsubstantiated.
          Attewater eyes him, but Father Auguste stands his ground.

                         ATTEWATER
          I have the utmost confidence in
          the ability of the Witchfinder
          General to determine the nature of
          the beast and put an end to it. I
          will dispatch a messenger in the
          morning.

                         CESAIRE
          Even if Father Solomon agrees to
          help us, it will take weeks for
          him to get here. That means
          another full moon. Maybe two.
          We must defend ourselves.
          A long, silent beat. Then, Henri stands.

                         HENRI
          He's right. The beast broke the
          peace, not us.

                         (TO CESAIRE)
          I will help you kill it.
          Henri's father gives him a surprised look. But after
          another long beat, the Reeve stands up, too.

                         REEVE
          As will I. We all will.
          Henri is nervous, but tries to appear brave for Isabelle.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN

          Isabelle is about to leave when she sees Lucie's red
          riding hood. She gives it a solemn look.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAWN

          A light snow has fallen. The girls are walking to
          Grandmother's house, but Isabelle sadly lags behind, lost
          in thought. She's wearing Lucie's red riding hood.

                         CONTINUED:
          Roxanne waits for Isabelle and offers her hand. Isabelle
          smiles sadly and takes it. Prudence and Rosemaria let
          them catch up, then they continue on together...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle returns home. Suzette is making dinner, but
          stops short when she sees Isabelle in Lucie's red cloak.

                         SUZETTE
          Who gave you permission to wear
          that?

                         ISABELLE
          Nobody. I just --

                         SUZETTE
          Your Grandmother made that for
          Lucie. Take it off.
          Isabelle hesitates, then does as she's told. Suzette
          snatches the cloak away from her. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          It was folded when they found her.
          Her clothes, too. Did you notice
          that?

                         SUZETTE
          Someone must have folded them.
          A beat. Isabelle is reluctant to voice her thoughts...

                         ISABELLE
          She was so unhappy.
          Suzette turns, her eyes narrowing dangerously.

                         SUZETTE
          What are you saying?

                         ISABELLE
          Maybe she went into the woods on
          purpose. Maybe she wanted to die.
          Suddenly: Suzette slaps her across the face. Hard.

                         SUZETTE
          Lucie's soul is at peace with God.
          Don't you ever again suggest
          otherwise.
          Suzette turns away in tears. Isabelle is stunned
          speechless.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          EXT. PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Isabelle trudges through the mud toward a ramshackle
          cottage. If there had been train tracks in the
          fourteenth century, this place would have been on the
          wrong side of them.
          Isabelle gathers her nerve and knocks on the door. A
          long beat. The door opens. It's Peter. He gives her a
          surprised look. She looks up at him, choking back tears.

                         PETER
          Are you all right?

                         ISABELLE
          I'm sorry. I just need to talk to
          someone. Can I come in?
          Peter balks. Just then, a figure appears. Isabelle
          can't believe her eyes... It's Rosemaria. She's
          standing behind Peter, but it's clear that she's naked.

                         ROSEMARIA
          No. You can't.
          She wraps an arm around Peter's waist. Isabelle gives
          him a stricken look and runs away. Peter watches her go.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Lessons are over. The girls are ready to leave except
          for Isabelle, who sits alone by the fire. Rosemaria
          gives her a sly look as she leaves. When the girls have
          gone, Grandmother sits down next to Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          I hate the cold. Why can't we
          have lessons in the summer?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I suppose that would be easier.
          But then that would defeat the
          purpose. People only change when
          things are difficult.
          Isabelle gives her a look, understanding, then turns
          away. Grandmother puts a hand on her shoulder and then
          leaves her alone. Isabelle stares into the fire...

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Roxanne comes home to a shocking scene: her mother,
          Marguerite, half-naked and wrapped in a blanket,

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         CONTINUED:
          viciously beating Claude with a switch. Roxanne
          hurriedly pulls her off of him and he runs away.

                         MARGUERITE
          I caught the little bastard
          watching us!

                         ROXANNE
          Watching what?
          Just then, the Merchant enters from the bedroom,
          adjusting his clothes. He hesitates when he sees
          Roxanne, then drops a handful of coins on the table and
          leaves. Marguerite puts the coins in a leather purse.
          Roxanne glares at her.

                         MARGUERITE
          It's money, isn't it? You could
          make twice this your first time.
          They pay more for virgins.
          Roxanne recoils in disgust and storms out in tears.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DUSK

          The full moon sign swings in the wind, a few flakes of
          snow whipping through the air around it.

          INT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Adrien picks up a hammer and a pickaxe. He hands the
          hammer to Henri, fixing him with a serious look.

                         ADRIEN
          Don't do this for Isabelle. She
          can't marry you if you're dead.

                         HENRI

                         (LYING)
          I'm not doing it for her.

                         ADRIEN
          Your mother would be proud to see
          the man you've become.
          Henri is moved. He nods, at a loss for words.

          INT. TAVERN COTTAGE - DUSK

          Not so much a tavern as the home of someone who decided
          to brew some beer and sell it. Cesaire stands before a
          group of men. They've all had too much to drink.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         CONTINUED:

                         CESAIRE
          My father died trying to kill the
          Wolf. For forty years, we have
          lived in fear of it. But no more.
          And never again. We don't need a
          Witchfinder General to rid of us
          this hell-hated beast. Because by
          God and all that is holy, the
          Beast of Villiers la CroisÃ©e shall
          die tonight!
          The men CHEER.

          EXT. VILLAGE - DUSK

          Cesaire leads the drunken group through the streets. The
          rest of the Villagers line the streets, watching them go.
          Claude tries to join the hunters, thinking it's a game,
          but Roxanne quickly catches him. Peter shakes his head
          at the dubious spectacle. Henri sees him.

                         HENRI
          You're not coming with us?

                         PETER
          Are you joking? These fools are
          as likely to kill each other as
          they are anything else.
          Henri shoots him an angry look before moving on.
          Isabelle and Suzette say goodbye to Cesaire. Isabelle
          sees Peter through the crowd and quickly looks away.
          Just then, Henri and Adrien pass by. On impulse,
          Isabelle runs up and kisses Henri on the mouth. When
          she's sure that Peter has seen this, she quickly walks
          away. Henri gives Peter a gloating look. Peter scowls.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - DUSK

          The Men have taken up positions just inside the treeline,
          one of them every twenty feet, surrounding the village.
          They each have lit torches. CAMERA FINDS Henri crouched
          in the brush. Cesaire walks along the line of men.

                         CESAIRE
          Get that torch out.
          Henri douses his torch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The full moon is high in the night sky. Snow is falling.
          CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES over the anxious face of the hunters.
          Adrien, clutching his pickaxe. The Reeve. The Merchant.
          The Carpenter. Shivering from cold and jangled nerves,
          staring wide-eyed into the dark and silent woods...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle lies in bed, but still awake. Suddenly... a
          wolf HOWLS outside. Her eyes widen.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The Reeve hears it. He clutches an old sword. Nearby,
          the Merchant cowers in the brush. Adrien listens as the
          wolf HOWLS over and over, louder each time. The
          Carpenter nervously peers out from his cover...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT

          The HOWLING is getting closer. Isabelle goes to the
          window, opens the shutter, cautiously peers out... and is
          startled by a HORRIBLE SCREAM in the distance.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          The Carpenter hears the SCREAM, too. He runs toward it
          and finds an extinguished torch on the ground. There are
          footprints in the snow. And blood. The brush around him
          RUSTLES and he jumps to his feet, axe held at the ready --
          -- but it's just the other Men, led by the Reeve.

                         REEVE
          Who was that screaming?

                         CARPENTER
          I don't know.

                         MERCHANT
          Look.
          He's gone pale. The others follow his look. There's a
          LARGE PAW PRINT in the snow. The Men stare at it.
          Suddenly, the same SCREAM pierces the night, this time
          coming from deeper in the woods. The Men exchange a wary
          look, but then start after it.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         CONTINUED:
          They run into a still clearing where the snow-covered
          brush is as high as their waists. They pause and listen.
          Only silence. They carefully make their way in the
          direction of the screams, quiet. Frost-brittle leaves
          CRUNCH under their feet...
          Suddenly -- something is moving in the brush. All they
          can see is the snowy brush violently shaking as it darts
          off, almost faster than it can be followed with the eye.
          It races right by the Merchant, knocking him on his ass,
          but it's gone before he can get a look at it.
          He startles as the Reeve pulls him to his feet.

                         REEVE
          Which way did it go?
          The Merchant points a trembling finger. The Reeve
          plunges into the brush after it and the Men follow.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - HILLSIDE - NIGHT

          The Reeve leads the Men to the foot of a steep and rocky
          hill. It's a dead end. But then they hear the SCREAMS
          again. The Men look up at the hillside.

                         CARPENTER
          The caves. It's in the caves.

          INT. CAVE - NIGHT

          The Men stand in the mouth of a wide cave, relighting
          their torches. The SCREAMING echoes from inside. The
          Carpenter raises his torch. The cave is as deep and dark
          as a monster's throat. The Men crowd start inside...
          The SCREAMING continues, unnerving the Men as they
          approach. Then they come to a fork in the tunnel. The
          SCREAMS bounce off the stone walls. Impossible to tell
          where it's coming from.

                         REEVE
          Split up. Two groups.
          Half the Men take one fork, half the other. We follow
          the Reeve's group down a narrowing passageway. The Men
          crowd together, hunched low. The SCREAMS seem to be
          getting louder. The Reeve stops, listening.
          He turns toward a low crack in the cave wall. The
          SCREAMS are coming from inside. He shines his torch
          inside, lowers his head, and walks toward it. The cave

          37.

                         CONTINUED:
          floor takes a steep dip. He has to keep one hand on the
          wall to keep from falling...
          Then suddenly, his feet skid on a patch of loose pebbles
          and he loses his footing. He slides down the steep
          floor, drops his torch, hands flailing, unable to stop
          himself, and then --
          -- he finds himself falling off a low cliff into the
          darkness. He tumbles head over heels down a rocky slope
          and splashes hard in a shallow underground river. The
          torch rolls off the ledge above and falls on the shore
          amidst a shower of grit and pebbles.
          The Reeve gets up, grimacing in pain, grabs the torch.
          He shines it around... and sees Adrien. He's leaning
          against a rock, the ground beneath him wet with blood
          spreading from a dark wound between his legs.
          Reeve rushes to his side and crosses himself when he sees
          the wound. Then: a low, menacing, GROWL. He turns...
          There's a huge, SNARLING GRAY WOLF behind him. Adrien's
          pickaxe juts from between its shoulder blades.
          Reeve freezes, suddenly realizing that he's dropped his
          sword. He splashes around in the river, blindly feeling
          for it in the water. The wounded animal growls, blood
          bubbling from between its teeth. Reeve finds the sword --
          -- just as the wolf attacks.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - DAWN

          Silence. The sun is starting to light the sky, revealing
          a peacefully glistening blanket of snow on the village.
          The Men are returning from the woods. Isabelle and
          Suzette are among the Villagers breathlessly awaiting
          them. No way of telling whether they met with success or
          failure. But as they near...
          ... we can see Reeve leading the group, carrying a pike
          with the wolf's severed head on it. The Villagers CHEER,
          but the Men are weary and subdued. Suzette and Isabelle
          find Cesaire. He hugs them tight.
          Suddenly, a woman GASPS. Then they see: the Men are
          carrying Adrien's body on a travois. Suzette chokes back
          her reaction. Henri walks with the body, eyes red and
          cried out. He passes Isabelle without looking at her.

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - DAY

          Henri hammers at a red-hot iron horseshoe. Isabelle
          enters. Henri doesn't seem to notice. A hesitant beat.

                         ISABELLE
          I heard your father wounded the
          beast. He was a brave man.

                         HENRI
          Did you hear what it did to him?
          It chewed off his private parts.
          Isabelle had not heard this. Henri doesn't stop working.

                         HENRI
          And I did nothing. I was too
          scared. I couldn't move. I just
          let my father be eaten alive.
          She moves toward him, but he shrugs her away.

                         HENRI
          No. I don't want you here.
          Isabelle gives him a sad look, then leaves. Henri just
          keeps hammering away on the anvil.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          A coffin is lowered into a grave. Father Auguste blesses
          it. Henri stands at his side. Isabelle is here with
          Roxanne. Lucrece eyes Isabelle, then whispers to her:

                         LUCRECE
          I thought your mother would be
          here. They used to be quite
          close.
          Isabelle gives her a sharp look, but Lucrece says nothing
          more. Isabelle looks down at the coffin with a sudden
          realization...

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          Suzette is soaking clothes in a bucket of lye, crying as
          she works. Isabelle approaches. Suzette quickly wipes
          her eyes. A beat. Isabelle gathers her nerve, then:

                         ISABELLE
          You told me you had a sweetheart
          before you were married. It was
          Henri's father, wasn't it?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         CONTINUED:
          Suzette freezes. She faces Isabelle, but doesn't answer.

                         ISABELLE
          Lucie was in love with Henri. She
          could have married him.
          (off Suzette's look)
          Couldn't she have?

                         SUZETTE
          We arranged for you to marry him.

                         ISABELLE
          But you gained the same no matter
          which one of us married him. So
          why did it have to be me?

                         SUZETTE
          I think you know the answer to
          that question.

                         ISABELLE
          No. You say it.
          Suzette's eyes well up. Then:

                         SUZETTE
          Lucie was Henri's half-sister.
          She was not your father's
          daughter.
          Isabelle suddenly looks ill. Reluctant, she asks:

                         ISABELLE
          Am I? Do you even know?

                         SUZETTE
          Yes. I was already pregnant when
          your father and I married.

                         ISABELLE
          Does he know?

                         SUZETTE
          No. And he must never know.
          Tears spill down Isabelle's cheeks. She walks away.

                         SUZETTE
          Isabelle!

                         (BEAT)
          Promise me you won't tell him.
          Isabelle gives her a look that doesn't promise much. She
          leaves without answering.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Grandmother ladles soup into a bowl and brings it to
          Isabelle. Isabelle's eyes are red from crying.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I've found that there's no burden
          that doesn't at least seem a
          little lighter on a full stomach.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know what to do. She
          wants me to pretend like I don't
          know. How am I supposed to go on
          living in that house?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You have a right to be angry with
          her. But try not to hate her.
          Too much hate will eat you alive.
          Isabelle nods and rests her head on Grandmother's
          shoulder.

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          As Isabelle enters the village, she hears LAUGHING and
          CAROUSING. Every cottage in the village is dark. Except
          one. Isabelle gathers her nerve and turns toward it...

          INT. TAVERN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Isabelle tentatively enters. There aren't many people
          here, just Marguerite and a few ROWDY MEN making a lot of
          noise. Isabelle instantly sees what she's here for:
          Cesaire is slumped in a corner, drunk and passed out.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle steers Cesaire through the doorway and drops him
          into the bed next to Suzette. He's already half-asleep.
          Suzette gives Isabelle a silent look, then turns away.
          Isabelle sighs. She sits next to Cesaire and kisses his
          forehead. As she stands, he clumsily takes her hand.

                         CESAIRE
          You're a good girl.
          Isabelle allows a sad smile, places his hand back on his
          chest, and leaves.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          The wolf's head has been placed atop a stake. Children
          throw rocks at it. Isabelle watches with Roxanne and
          Prudence.

                         PRUDENCE
          I heard there's going to be a
          festival on the night of the next
          full moon. To celebrate.

                         ROXANNE
          A festival? I've never been to
          one!

                         PRUDENCE
          My father says he hasn't seen one
          since he was a boy.

                         ROXANNE
          It's strange, isn't it? You think
          because things have been a certain
          way your whole life that they'll
          always be the same. Then
          overnight everything just changes.
          But Isabelle is distracted. Amidst the morning bustle,
          she sees Rosemaria laughing with Peter. Roxanne notices.
          Just then, they hear HORSES approaching. A lot of them.
          Everyone stops what they're doing, listening, suddenly
          apprehensive. The girls turn toward the sound and see...
          ... A DOZEN SOLDIERS in identical armor, silver helmets
          gleaming in the sun, riding into the square atop armored
          steeds. The Villagers gape at them in awe.
          The Soldiers ride escort to a WHITE COACH with a red
          cross on it, drawn by two horses: one white, one black.
          A FIGURE rides inside, cloaked in darkness. Isabelle
          gives it an uneasy look.
          Leading the Soldiers is the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD, his
          helmet adorned with a blood-red plume. He brings the
          caravan to a halt in front of the Merchant's shop.

                         CAPTAIN
          This is Villiers la CroisÃ©e?

                         MERCHANT
          Yes, my lord.

                         CAPTAIN
          Summon your bailiff. My master
          would speak with him at once.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         CONTINUED:

                         MERCHANT
          Of course, my lord. May I ask to
          what does he owe this honor?

                         CAPTAIN
          He requested the services of His
          Eminence, the Witchfinder General.
          You may tell him that he has
          arrived.
          All eyes turn to the figure in the coach. Only a
          bejeweled hand is visible, resting on the coach's window.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY (LATER)

          A Soldier places a wooden step next to the coach and
          another opens the door. The whole village has turned
          out, but they're keeping their distance. Even Attewater,
          standing front and center, seems uneasy.
          The figure emerges from the coach. A grizzled man with
          penetrating eyes and a black beard, wearing a strange
          amalgam of priestly white robes and decidedly un-priestly
          battle armor. A broadsword hangs from his hip, the hilt
          depicting Christ on the cross. With the sword sheathed,
          the cross is upside-down. This is FATHER SOLOMON.

                         ATTEWATER
          This is indeed an honor, Your
          Eminence.
          Solomon makes no response. His eyes are on the severed
          wolf's head on display. Attewater smiles proudly.

                         ATTEWATER
          As you can see, our werewolf
          problem has been dealt with.

                         SOLOMON
          That is no werewolf.
          Surprise and outrage ripple through the crowd. Isabelle
          and Roxanne exchange a shocked look.

                         SOLOMON
          When a werewolf dies, it returns
          to its human form. If what you
          killed was a werewolf, then you
          would have a human head skewered
          atop that pole.

                         REEVE
          And I suppose you've seen this? A
          wolf turning into a man?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         CONTINUED:
          Solomon levels a look at the Reeve and slowly walks
          toward him. The Reeve is taller, but Solomon is, without
          doubt, the bigger man. The Reeve's eyes flick nervously
          to the armored Soldiers and their swords. A beat.

                         SOLOMON
          My wife's name was PÃ©nÃ©lope. She
          was very pretty. And we were very
          happy.
          The Reeve tries to keep the confusion off his face.
          Attewater and Father Auguste exchange uncertain looks.

                         SOLOMON
          We lived in a village not unlike
          this place. And not unlike this
          place, our village was plagued by
          a werewolf. I went out with some
          men to hunt it. It never even
          occurred to me that we might
          actually find it. But we did.
          He has everyone's attention now. All eyes are on him.

                         SOLOMON
          It attacked me. All I saw were
          yellow teeth. I hacked at it with
          an axe and suddenly it was gone.
          There was blood on my axe. I had
          cut off one of its paws. I picked
          it up and put it in my sack.

                         (BEAT)
          When I returned home in the
          morning, I found my wife with a
          bloody rag tied around her left
          wrist. And when I opened my sack,
          the werewolf's paw was gone. This
          is what I found in its place.
          Solomon takes an old leather sack from his belt, reaches
          inside... and pulls out a WOMAN'S MUMMIFIED HAND wearing
          a wedding ring. There are gasps from the crowd.

                         SOLOMON
          Her name was PÃ©nÃ©lope. She was
          very pretty. And we were very
          happy. Until the day I killed
          her.
          Solomon turns and gives Attewater a hard look.

                         SOLOMON
          Your werewolf is still alive. And
          I promise you, it will kill again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Soldiers stand at every door. Solomon and Attewater sit
          in front of the gathered Villagers. Solomon's Captain
          stands behind him. Isabelle nervously notes that the
          Captain wears a spiked flail. The black iron ball is
          shaped like a skull with spikes coming out of it.

                         SOLOMON
          I have examined the body of your
          blacksmith. There were bruises on
          his neck from where the beast held
          him in its jaws, squeezing his
          throat so that he could not
          scream.

                         CESAIRE
          But he did scream. We all heard
          him.

                         SOLOMON
          Only when it wanted you to. It
          used him as bait to lure you into
          the bit of theater it had
          prepared.

                         HENRI
          Theater? My father is not
          playacting. He is dead.

                         REEVE
          And I killed the beast that did
          it.

                         SOLOMON
          That's what it wants you to think.
          It did kill your blacksmith. But
          the animal that you killed was not
          the werewolf.

                         REEVE
          There was blood dripping from its
          teeth.

                         SOLOMON
          The blood was its own. The
          werewolf most likely wounded it
          earlier in the evening and left it
          in the cave for you to find and
          kill.

                         CESAIRE
          'Most likely,' he says. Have you
          ever heard anything more unlikely
          in your lives?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         CONTINUED:
          The Villagers laugh. Lucrece eyes them, disapproving.

                         ATTEWATER
          Your Eminence, if what you say is
          true, that we were somehow fooled
          by this thing, it could not have
          done so without foreknowledge of
          our plan to hunt it.

                         SOLOMON
          That's correct. The werewolf does
          not live in the forest as you have
          rather naÃ¯vely assumed. It lives
          here in the village. Among you.
          There is a moment of shocked silence. Then mounting
          anger. Cesaire stands up and gestures to Henri.

                         CESAIRE
          You come here and tell us that
          this boy's father died for
          nothing. You accuse us and call
          us fools. Well, I believe what I
          can see with my own eyes. That
          wolf is dead. And I know it's
          dead because I was with the brave
          men who killed it.

                         MERCHANT
          And what of the festival?

                         ATTEWATER
          The festival was to celebrate the
          death of the Wolf.

                         MERCHANT
          And we say that it's dead! We've
          spent every full moon for the past
          forty years cowering in our homes.
          We've earned a celebration.

                         REEVE
          And paid for it in blood!
          Attewater gives Solomon a nervous look. Solomon shrugs.

                         SOLOMON
          Have your festival. I will stay
          on here until then to ensure that
          you have the celebration you all
          so richly deserve.
          The Villagers seem appeased, especially the smug
          Merchant. A look passes between Solomon and his Captain.
          Isabelle catches it... and finds it unsettling.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          The moon sign displays the angry full moon, but it has
          been decorated with ribbons and mistletoe. Despite the
          cold, the mood in the village is happy and excited.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Solomon is anointing each of his Soldiers with holy water
          from a basin held by Father Auguste...

                         SOLOMON
          Gloria Patri, et Filio, et
          Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erat in
          principio, et nunc, et sempter, et
          in saecula saeculorum. Amen.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAY

          Isabelle wears her best dress, her hair decorated with
          ribbons. Cesaire is asleep, a flask in his hand.
          Suzette knits.

                         ISABELLE
          I'm going to the festival.

                         SUZETTE
          All right then.
          She doesn't look up from her knitting. Isabelle leaves.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY

          Solomon kneels in prayer, lit by flickering candlelight.
          He kisses the image of Christ on the hilt of his sword...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          The festival is in full swing. A bonfire ROARS. The
          Villagers sing and drink. A MAN in a wolf costume jumps
          out and startles the women and children. The children
          chase him with sticks and he comically runs away.
          Isabelle watches their antics with Roxanne and Prudence.
          Claude is laughing and chasing the man in the wolf
          costume, but an OLDER BOY purposefully trips him.
          Another BOY steals his cap and teases him. Marguerite is
          too busy carousing to notice. Roxanne frowns.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm sorry...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         CONTINUED:
          She hurries to help Claude. Isabelle and Prudence watch.

                         PRUDENCE
          She acts more like a mother to him
          than a sister.

                         ISABELLE
          Someone has to look after him.

                         PRUDENCE
          I know. But who looks after her?
          Isabelle gives Roxanne a sad look.

          EXT. CHURCH - BELLTOWER - DUSK

          The Captain of Solomon's guard stands watch. The sounds
          of the FESTIVAL can be heard in the distance...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK

          Men play MUSIC and couples dance. Roxanne dances with
          Claude, Prudence with an OLDER BOY... but Isabelle sits
          alone, watching Peter dance with Rosemaria.
          Just then, Henri stumbles toward Isabelle with a beer,
          clearly the latest of many. He follows her look and sees
          that she's watching Peter. Henri glares at him...
          ... then abruptly pushes his way toward Peter and grabs
          him roughly by the shoulder, spinning him around. Peter
          is surprised, but ready to laugh it off.

                         PETER
          Take it easy, friend.

                         HENRI
          You didn't come with us. The
          night my father died.
          Peter's smile fades. Isabelle rushes to pull Henri away.

                         HENRI
          You stayed here and let real men
          do the work you didn't have the
          belly for.

                         ISABELLE
          Please, don't do this --
          Henri brushes her aside, but too hard and she stumbles.
          Peter instantly grabs hold of Henri's wrist. Henri

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         CONTINUED:
          overreacts and punches Peter in the eye. Peter falls on
          his ass, but the Villagers just laugh.
          Peter slowly stands, staring Henri down. He could easily
          lay Henri out... but decides against it. He leaves.
          Rosemaria reaches out to him, but he ignores her.
          Isabelle shoots Henri a look of contempt, then hurries
          off after Peter. Henri watches her go, ashamed.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DUSK

          Peter storms off. Isabelle runs after him.

                         ISABELLE
          Peter! Wait!

                         PETER
          Why? So you can hit me, too?

                         ISABELLE
          I just want to make sure you're
          all right.
          Peter stops. He whirls on Isabelle, incredulous.

                         PETER
          Why can't you just leave me alone?

                         ISABELLE
          You're bleeding.

                         PETER
          So what? What's the matter with
          you? What do I have to do to make
          you stop caring about me?
          Isabelle is taken aback. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          You think I want to feel like
          this? You think I enjoy feeling
          like a fool every day because I
          can't stop loving you?
          Peter's bravado falters. He can't completely hide what
          her words do to him. She looks up at him, realizing...

                         ISABELLE
          Why are you with Rosemaria? You
          hate Rosemaria.

                         PETER
          I don't have to like her to get
          what I want from her.

                         ISABELLE
          You're a terrible liar.
          Isabelle takes a step closer and presses the palm of her
          hand against his chest. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          There. You're heart is starting
          to beat faster. And the little
          black circles in the middle of
          your eyes still get bigger when I
          touch you.
          She gazes up at him. He tries not to look in her eyes,
          but can't stop himself.

                         ISABELLE
          You can tell me you don't love me,
          but I know what you're really
          feeling. I can feel it with my
          hand and see it with my eyes.
          Peter hesitates, then covers her hand with his own.

                         PETER
          I thought being with Rosemaria
          would be the one thing you would
          never be able to forgive. I
          wanted you to hate me.
          (off her look)
          Isabelle, you are the best thing
          that could ever happen to me. And
          I am the worst thing that could
          ever happen to you.

                         ISABELLE
          How could you think that?

                         PETER
          I wasn't born here. You and I
          both know what that means. I will
          always be a stranger to these
          people. Your parents will never
          let us be together.

                         ISABELLE
          That means less to me now than
          ever. We can leave here. We can
          go someplace where we'll both be
          strangers.

                         PETER
          I can't let you do that. You have
          something here that I will never
          have. You have a place. You have

          a family. With Henri you have a
          future. I'm not going to let you
          ruin that over me.

                         ISABELLE
          The only life I want is with you.

                         PETER
          Isabelle... I'm wrong for you.

                         ISABELLE
          I know you are. I just don't
          care.
          She kisses him on the mouth, then quickly steps back, as
          if she did it before she could change her mind. Then he
          takes her in his arms and they kiss, long and hard.

          INT. BARN - DUSK

          A door opens and Peter and Isabelle enter, still kissing.
          He closes the door, pushes her against it with his body.
          He lowers her to pile of straw in an empty stall. She
          looks up at him, surprised, then pulls him tightly to
          her, kissing him hard. She grabs his hand and guides it
          to her breast. Now Peter looks surprised. He hesitates.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't want to wait.

                         PETER
          But not like this.

                         (A BEAT)
          I want to marry you.
          She searches his face and sees that he's serious.

                         PETER
          I can pack the cart tonight and we
          can leave in the morning.
          (off her look)
          Is that too soon?

                         ISABELLE
          It's not soon enough.
          She pulls him to her and kisses him.

          EXT. BARN - DUSK

          Peter looks outside. The coast is clear. He and
          Isabelle slip out and close the door behind them.

          You'd better get back before
          someone misses you.
          She gives him a lingering kiss. When she pulls away from
          him, he sees that she's crying.

                         PETER
          What's wrong?

                         ISABELLE
          This feels like a dream. I'm
          afraid if I leave you I might wake
          up.
          He kisses her and holds her tight. Neither of them
          notice Henri, angrily watching from the shadows...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT

          Isabelle returns to the festival. She sits next to
          Roxanne, who notices a piece of straw in Isabelle's hair.
          Isabelle quickly brushes it away, embarrassed.
          Isabelle's eyes go to the sky. The sun has finally set.
          The moon has risen, silver and full. Isabelle gazes up
          at it, transfixed. Roxanne looks over at her, curious.

                         ISABELLE
          I've never seen it full before...
          Suddenly -- the CHURCH BELLS start to ring. Everyone
          falls silent. Confused looks all around. Then,
          somewhere in the dark...
          ... a WOLF HOWLS. The Villagers gasp. A WOMAN screams.
          People start to panic. Claude is knocked down.

                         ROXANNE
          Claude!
          Then something massive pushes its way through the surging
          crowd, bursting from the darkness...
          It's THE WOLF. The Villagers gape in horror. It makes
          the wolf that they killed look like a chihuahua. But
          there's something about its face that isn't canine at
          all, but ghoulishly human as it HOWLS at the moon.
          Suddenly, a group of Villagers throw off their cloaks,
          revealing themselves to be Solomon's armored Soldiers.
          Each of them draws a gleaming sword and points it at the
          Wolf. They've been lying in wait and now they have it
          surrounded. The Wolf SNARLS at them.

          52.

                         CONTINUED:
          A moment later, Father Solomon gallops into the square on
          his armored steed, wearing a helmet adorned with a golden
          eagle. He tugs the reins and his horse rears back.

                         SOLOMON
          Get to the church, you fools!
          The Wolf SNARLS up at him. Solomon gives a battle cry:

                         SOLOMON

          DIE, BEAST! AND LONG LIVE GOD'S

          HOLY LOVE!
          The Wolf ROARS. Solomon and his men charge toward it.
          The Villagers caught between them trample one another to
          get away. A MAN gets knocked into the bonfire. Flaming
          logs fall off the pyre and set a cottage ABLAZE.
          The Wolf swipes Solomon's Soldiers aside like rag dolls.
          They bravely press the attack, but they're no match for
          the beast. It swats one of them right through the wall
          of a nearby cottage. The ambush has backfired.
          The Carpenter sees Claude on the ground and picks him up,
          trying to help. Claude fights and screams, but the
          Carpenter carries him away. Roxanne starts toward him --
          -- and is bowled over by Solomon's horse. Solomon grabs
          the stake with the wolf's head atop it and charges at the
          Wolf, wielding the stake like a lance. The Wolf catches
          the stake in its jaws, throwing Solomon off his horse.
          Just as the Wolf is about to pounce on him, but more
          Soldiers join the fight. The Wolf sees them coming. It
          attacks Solomon's horse, biting its neck and dragging it
          to the ground. As the Soldiers close in --
          -- the Wolf spins around, hurling the injured horse at
          them, knocking them down like bowling pins. Another
          Soldier tries to attack the Wolf from behind, but it
          smacks him aside with its tail and then smashes him to
          the ground with one enormous paw.
          Isabelle hurriedly helps Roxanne to her feet and drags
          her away from the ongoing battle.

                         ROXANNE
          Where's Claude? Where is he?!

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          The Carpenter runs away with Claude in his arms, but
          Claude bites his hand and wriggles free. Claude falls to
          the ground and dashes back toward the square.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Roxanne runs through town like a rat in a maze, jostled
          by the fleeing Villagers. Isabelle races after her.

                         ROXANNE
          Claude! Claude!
          Roxanne spots Rosemaria and grabs her, begging for help.

                         ROXANNE
          Have you seen my brother? Please!
          But Rosemaria just pushes her aside, panicked. An
          instant later -- the Wolf appears out of nowhere, jumping
          on Rosemaria. She screams, then -- CRUNCH. The screams
          stop. Isabelle and Roxanne gape in horror, then run.

          EXT. CHURCH - BELLTOWER - NIGHT

          The Captain RINGS the church bell. People are fleeing
          the village and running toward the church.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          The few Villagers left hurry into their homes and bolt
          the doors behind them. TWO SOLDIERS search the nearly
          empty streets for the Wolf, swords drawn.
          Soldier #1 looks down... and sees bloody paw prints in
          the snow. He points them out to Solider #2. They follow
          the tracks to a corner, carefully peer around it...
          The Wolf is about ten feet away, loudly tearing meat from
          Rosemaria's body. Soldier #1 gestures for his companion
          to approach from the other side. They split up.
          Soldier #1 peers out at the Wolf... but it's gone. The
          street is empty. Only Rosemaria's body lying in the
          bloodstained snow. He ducks back around the corner...
          ... and we see that the Wolf is now right behind him.
          Meanwhile, Soldier #2 is stealthily making his way into
          position... when he suddenly hears Soldier #1 SCREAMING.
          Soldier #2 quickly ducks inside a nearby cottage...

          INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT

          ... and peers out the window. He sees Soldier #1
          painfully crawling through the snow, clutching a mangled
          and bloody wound on his shoulder.

                         SOLDIER #1
          Help... Help me...
          Soldier #2 ducks back from the window. No way. He's not
          going out there. Then: SNIFF. SNIFF.
          There's a shadow visible under the crack of the cottage
          door. And a big black snout pressed up against it,
          SNIFFING out its prey. Soldier #2 readies his sword...
          ... but then the Wolf moves away. A long beat. The
          Soldier edges toward the door. The shadow does not
          return. He slowly reaches out a hand to open the door...
          Suddenly, the door is blasted off its hinges and the Wolf
          bursts inside. It stands on top of the door, pinning the
          Soldier beneath it. The Soldier tries to raise his
          sword, but can't. The Wolf SNARLS down at him, drooling.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          The Wolf is dragging Soldier #2's body out of the cottage
          by the ankles when its ears suddenly prick up. It's
          heard something. It's being watched. It looks up...
          ... and sees Claude standing at the end of the street,
          paralyzed with fear. The Wolf GROWLS, blood dripping
          from its chin. Claude runs. The Wolf leaps after him.
          Claude turns a corner, looks back, sees the Wolf headed
          right for him. Claude ducks into an alley and the Wolf
          follows him...

          EXT./INT. BARN - NIGHT

          ... only to find Claude has disappeared. The Wolf
          follows Claude's tracks in the snow to the door of a barn
          and peers inside. The barn appears to be empty...
          ... but Claude is hiding in a hayloft. The Wolf SNIFFS
          the air. Pushes the door open with its nose and pads
          inside. Looks around. Claude shivers. But just then:

          ROXANNE (O.S.)
          Claude! Claude!!
          The Wolf cocks its ears toward the voice, listening...

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Roxanne are the last stragglers, Roxanne
          looking for Claude, Isabelle trying to stop her.

          Isabelle drags her to the ground and covers her mouth.

                         ISABELLE
          You have to stop it. He can't
          hear you and you are going to get
          us killed. Do you understand me?
          Roxanne nods, crying. Isabelle helps her up -- and finds
          herself face-to-face with the Wolf. Roxanne screams.
          They run back the way they came, turn another corner --

          EXT. VILLAGE - ALLEY - NIGHT

          -- but the narrow alley is blocked by a high stone wall.

                         ISABELLE
          Come on!
          Isabelle climbs the wall, but Roxanne's not going to make
          it. Isabelle jumps down to help her...
          ... just as the Wolf's shadow falls over the alley. The
          girls watch helplessly as the Wolf slowly walks toward
          them, SNARLING and glaring at them with its strange, near-
          human eyes. Then, inexplicably... the Wolf speaks.

                         THE WOLF
          Well, well. You look very pretty
          this evening, my dear. Good
          enough to eat.
          The Wolf's voice is sonorous, seductive. The Devil's
          voice. Isabelle stammers, unable to believe her senses.

                         THE WOLF
          It's considered polite to thank
          someone when they pay you a
          compliment. Are you being
          impolite, Isabelle?

                         ISABELLE
          How do you know me? Who are you?

                         ROXANNE
          Isabelle...?
          The Wolf GROWLS, cutting her off, and turns back to
          Isabelle. It moves closer. Isabelle looks into its
          eyes. They suddenly seem very big and deep, almost
          hypnotizing. She seems to fall into them...

          What big eyes you have...

                         THE WOLF
          The better to see you with, my
          dear.

                         ISABELLE
          Are you going to kill us?

                         THE WOLF
          Kill you? Why would I kill you?

                         ISABELLE
          Then what do you want?

                         THE WOLF
          I want you, Isabelle.
          Isabelle gapes, dumbstruck and dismayed.

                         THE WOLF
          We are the same, you and I. We
          are both wild things. You show
          one face to the world, but there
          is another face that you hide. A
          fire burning inside you, waiting
          to be released.
          The Wolf sniffs her, starting at her feet and working its
          way up. It SNARLS with satisfaction, savoring her scent.

                         THE WOLF
          Yes. I can smell it on you even
          now.
          Suddenly, the Wolf jumps onto its hind legs, puts its
          forepaws on the wall on either side of Isabelle, its
          muzzle only inches from her face. She recoils.

                         THE WOLF
          Leave with me tonight. Run with
          me. The only shackles binding you
          are of your own making. Slip them
          and I can show you the world and
          every pleasure in it.
          Isabelle hesitates, then finds the strength to speak:

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know who you are, but we
          are not the same. I would rather
          die than go with you.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         THE WOLF
          What about your fat friend here?
          Do you think she would rather die?
          (off Isabelle's look)
          Come away with me. Or I will kill
          her. And I will keep killing
          until you agree to leave with me.
          Suddenly, the sound of MEN SHOUTING. The Wolf leans in,
          SNARLING. Isabelle turns away from its foul breath.

                         THE WOLF
          Choose now. Quickly.
          Isabelle trembles. She looks down at Roxanne's terrified
          face, torn. Isabelle closes her eyes. She can't do it.

                         THE WOLF
          Your silence has doomed them all.
          Just then, Solomon and two Soldiers turn the corner. The
          Wolf leaps atop the wall and growls down at Isabelle:

                         THE WOLF
          Come the next full moon, their
          blood will be on your hands.
          Then it jumps over the wall. Solomon scrabbles up after
          it, but the Wolf is already too far away. It looks back
          at him. A silent challenge passes between them. And
          then the Wolf is gone.

          INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

          Solomon and his Soldiers bring Isabelle and Roxanne
          inside. A crowd of panicked Villagers swarms to Solomon.

                         SOLOMON
          We are safe here. God protects
          his own house and those within it.
          Isabelle finds Prudence.

                         ISABELLE
          Is Peter here?

                         PRUDENCE
          Peter? I don't think so.

                         ISABELLE
          What about Claude? Or my parents?

                         PRUDENCE
          I haven't seen any of them.

          58.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          Would you look for them? Please?
          Prudence nods and rushes off. Roxanne slumps in a
          corner, a dazed look on her face. A beat.

                         ROXANNE
          You talked to it.

                         ISABELLE
          It talked to us.
          A chill runs down Roxanne's spine. A long beat.

                         ROXANNE
          No. It only growled.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          You heard it talk to you?
          Isabelle doesn't know what to say. She glances around to
          see if anyone has overheard. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          Do not speak of this to anyone.
          Roxanne nods, but eyes Isabelle warily. Isabelle turns
          away, afraid and confused.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAWN

          Silence. The door CREAKS open and the Merchant peers
          out. A blanket of new snow covers the village. It's as
          if the massacre of the night before never happened.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAWN

          Isabelle hurries inside. Embers burn in the fire pit. A
          chair has been overturned. The room is empty.

                         ISABELLE
          Mother! Father!

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAWN

          Isabelle bursts in to find Suzette lying in bed and
          Cesaire leaning over her, crying. Isabelle stops short.

                         ISABELLE
          Is she dead?

                         CESAIRE
          No, thank God.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          He sits up, revealing Suzette's face, which has been
          horribly slashed from scalp to chin. Isabelle recoils.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The Villagers slowly gather. Dead bodies litter the
          snow. Roxanne clutches Prudence's arm. Henri joins
          them. Father Auguste crouches next to Soldier #1.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          This man is alive!

                         (TO HENRI)
          Bring me water! Hurry!
          Henri nods and quickly turns -- but is stopped cold by
          Solomon's iron grip on his arm. Solomon and his Captain
          go to Soldier #1. Solomon kneels at his side.

                         SOLOMON
          Are you bitten?
          Shivering, the Soldier nods. The Captain closes his
          eyes. Solomon stands and turns to Father Auguste.

                         SOLOMON
          Step back.
          Confused, Father Auguste does as he's told. Then, before
          anyone can react, Solomon draws his sword and plunges it
          into the Soldier's heart. Everyone startles.

                         SOLOMON
          The werewolf's bite is the same as
          death to a man.
          Stunned silence. Solomon turns to the Villagers.

                         SOLOMON
          The dark days have returned to
          your village. Your homes are no
          longer safe. The Wolf will
          return. Again and again. And it
          will not stop until it has sucked
          the marrow from all your bones.
          Unless you stop it.

                         (BEAT)
          But to kill a monster, you must
          become one yourself. A wolf
          caught in a trap will chew off its
          own leg to save itself. Will you
          do the same? What sacrifice will
          you make to save your families and
          your way of life? Will you do
          whatever it takes? Or will you

          60.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON (CONT'D)
          cower in your beds and die like
          sheep?
          A long beat. The Villagers shiver and not just from the
          cold. But no one speaks. Solomon turns to Attewater.

                         SOLOMON
          It appears my expertise is not as
          appreciated as I was led to
          believe.
          He turns to leave. Suddenly, Attewater steps forward.

                         ATTEWATER
          Wait!
          Attewater drops to one knee. Solomon stops and gives him
          an appraising look. Then Solomon turns to the Villagers.
          After a moment, the Reeve drops to his knee. One by one,
          the Villagers kneel to Solomon. Henri and Father Auguste
          are among the last, but they reluctantly kneel as well.

                         ATTEWATER
          We will do what must be done.
          A beat. Then Solomon offers his hand. Attewater kisses
          Solomon's ring. Henri and Roxanne exchange uneasy looks.

          INT. PETER'S COTTAGE - DAY

          There's an urgent knock at the door. Peter quickly opens
          it. It's Isabelle. He ushers her inside. As soon as
          the door is shut, he takes her in his arms. She gives
          him a concerned look. He looks tired, drawn and pale.

                         PETER
          I was up all night worrying about
          you. Thank God you're safe.
          But something about her expression gives him pause. She
          looks up at him, struggling with what she has to say.

                         ISABELLE
          Peter... My mother's hurt. I
          can't leave. Not now.

                         PETER
          I thought you didn't want to wait.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't have any choice. It's not
          just my mother. Something else
          happened last night.
          (off his look)

                         ISABELLE (CONT'D)
          I can't tell you about it. I just
          have to stay.
          Peter nods, but his face darkens. A long, tense beat.

                         ISABELLE
          I meant everything I said. This
          isn't what I wanted.

                         PETER
          Of course not. You'd better go
          home and see to your mother.
          She gives him a sad nod, then turns to go. She pauses at
          the door, but he doesn't look at her. She leaves.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Solomon places his silver sword on the table in front of
          Attewater and Father Auguste.

                         SOLOMON
          Silver. This is our most potent
          weapon. One blow will kill it.

                         (BEAT)
          That sword has tasted the blood of
          many such creatures. But never
          one as powerful as this.

                         ATTEWATER
          If it's that powerful, how can we
          possibly hope to stop it?

                         SOLOMON
          We must find it in its human form.
          Who among you do you suspect?
          Attewater and Father Auguste trade uncomfortable looks.
          Neither of them wants to speak up first.

                         SOLOMON
          It has not survived this long by
          being obvious. The signs will be
          subtle. Insomnia. Restlessness.
          Strange behavior. Strange smells.
          (off their looks)
          Well, none of them smell good, but
          we must start somewhere.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          What about the hair Madame
          Ordeville found on Lucie's body?
          It was dark. The person we are
          looking for must have dark hair.

          62.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Perhaps. Unless it planted the
          hair to make us think that.

                         ATTEWATER
          Yes, it's trying to trick us
          again. This has been happening
          for forty years. It must be an
          old man by now. The hair should
          have been gray.

                         SOLOMON
          Not necessarily. It may be the
          child or grandchild of the
          werewolf that first struck here.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          The curse is hereditary?

                         SOLOMON
          It is. But it effects men and
          women differently. A man can
          inherit the curse. Or he can be
          turned simply by being bitten.
          Solomon turns toward the fire and stares into it.

                         SOLOMON
          But women are immune to the
          werewolf's bite. In order for a
          woman to be turned, she must
          inherit the curse. But even then
          it will lie dormant unless she
          eats human flesh. Only then will
          the bite of a male werewolf change
          her. Only then can she become a
          werewolf and capable of passing
          the curse on to her own children.

                         ATTEWATER
          But it could be a woman.

                         SOLOMON
          Of course. It could be any one of
          you.
          Attewater and Father Auguste exchange a wary look.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CROSSROADS - DAWN

          The mood of the village is grim. Isabelle meets Roxanne
          at the crossroads. Roxanne eyes her warily. A beat.

                         ROXANNE
          No. Nobody has seen him.

                         ISABELLE
          He's run away before. He'll be
          all right.
          Roxanne nods, unconvinced. Prudence joins them. They
          all exchange a sad look.

                         PRUDENCE
          Well. I suppose this is all of
          us.
          The three of them turn and start toward the woods...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Grandmother sit by the fire.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          It talked to you. And you
          understood it?

                         ISABELLE
          As clearly as I do you now.
          Grandmother fixes her with a serious look. A beat.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Word of this cannot be allowed to
          spread. Do you understand me?

                         ISABELLE
          Roxanne will never speak of it.
          She won't even talk to me about
          it.
          A long beat. Isabelle is working up her nerve. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          I have to do what it wants.
          (off her look)
          I have communed with an unholy
          beast. What does that make me if
          not cursed?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I don't know. But I won't allow
          you to go with this devil and live
          as its concubine.

                         ISABELLE
          But if it comes back for me and I
          don't go with it, then it will
          kill again. If I have the power
          to save even one life, aren't I
          compelled to do so?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          This is why it chose you. You're
          a good girl with a gentle heart.
          It's using that against you.

                         ISABELLE
          But how could it? Unless it
          really does know me?
          Isabelle and Grandmother exchange an anxious look...

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY

          Isabelle is walking home through the snow. Henri is
          waiting for her. A beat. Then:

                         HENRI
          I spoke with your father. I broke
          off our engagement.
          (off her look)
          I saw you with Peter. Don't
          worry, I didn't tell anyone.
          Isabelle can't hide her shock. She shifts anxiously.

                         ISABELLE
          What about my family's debt?

                         HENRI
          I have no interest in ruining your
          family. I will have you out of
          love or not at all.
          Isabelle is dumbfounded. Henri turns and walks away...

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT

          Isabelle is cooking, lost in thought. Suddenly, there's
          a KNOCK at the door. Isabelle opens it. It's Prudence.

                         PRUDENCE
          They've caught the werewolf!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Prudence leads Isabelle and Cesaire through the village.
          There are SHOUTING VOICES up ahead.

                         PRUDENCE
          He's been hiding in a hayloft.
          They caught him trying to steal
          food.

                         ISABELLE
          But who is it?
          An angry crowd has gathered. Solomon's Soldiers are all
          that's stopping it from turning into a lynch mob.
          Isabelle finds Roxanne in tears, trying to force her way
          through the crowd.

                         ISABELLE
          What's wrong? What's happening?
          Roxanne doesn't answer, just plunges into the crowd.
          Isabelle goes in after her. Cesaire tries to stop her.

                         CESAIRE
          Isabelle! Get away from there!
          She follows Roxanne to the front of the crowd, just as
          two Soldiers haul a figure out of a barn -- it's Claude.

                         ROXANNE
          Claude!!

                         ISABELLE
          It's not him! It can't be!

                         LUCRECE
          If he's not the werewolf, then why
          was he hiding? What's he afraid
          of?
          The Soldiers carry Claude off and Roxanne stumbles after
          them. Isabelle tries to follow, but Cesaire stops her.
          She can only watch helplessly as Claude is dragged away.

          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DAY

          Villagers are gathering. The whole town must be here.
          As Attewater approaches the entrance:

          GRANDMOTHER (O.S.)
          Salus populi suprema est lex.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         CONTINUED:
          He turns and sees Grandmother walking toward him. She
          nods to the inscription above the entrance. 'SALUS

          POPULI SUPREMA EST LEX.'

                         GRANDMOTHER
          The good of the people is the
          chief law.

                         ATTEWATER
          You read Latin.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          And write. I was studying to be a
          nun when I met my husband.

                         ATTEWATER
          He must have been some man.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          He was a priest.
          She grins. Is she being serious? Attewater bristles.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You know the boy is innocent.
          He's being tried because he's
          different. Because Father Solomon
          knows he can turn us against him.

                         ATTEWATER
          Father Solomon is here to protect
          us.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          A wolf hunting sheep picks off the
          weakest ones first.
          (off his look)
          This is just the beginning.
          She enters the manor hall. Attewater watches her go.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

          The room is crammed with Villagers. Isabelle sits with
          Cesaire and Grandmother. Attewater sits behind the
          table. Claude is shackled and guarded by Soldiers. He
          looks afraid, confused. Solomon questions Lucrece. A
          SCRIBE records the proceedings.

                         SOLOMON
          You say you saw the accused
          perform magic?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         CONTINUED:

                         LUCRECE
          In broad daylight with my own
          eyes. Everyone here has seen it.

                         SOLOMON
          So it was common knowledge that
          the accused was a conjurer?

                         LUCRECE
          Yes, Your Eminence. I saw it for
          the Devil's work, but they laughed
          at me and paid him money.
          Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a concerned look.
          Through a SERIES OF CUTS, more witnesses are questioned:

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          shifts uncomfortably as Solomon interrogates him...

                         SOLOMON
          Are you aware that it is the
          custom of witches and devil
          worshippers to hold their black
          sabbaths in cemeteries?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          Yes, Your Eminence.

                         SOLOMON
          And do you know of their practice
          of dancing with invisible devils
          during these rituals?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          I have heard it said so, yes.

                         SOLOMON
          Is there one here today who you
          have seen dancing in your
          cemetery?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          (hesitant; a beat)
          Yes. But I don't believe he meant
          anything by it. It was in jest.

                         SOLOMON
          So you consider the black mass to
          be a jest?
          There are suspicious WHISPERS among the Villagers.
          Father Auguste eyes them nervously. A beat.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         CONTINUED:

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          No, of course not.

                         SOLOMON
          Then point him out.
          Father Auguste reluctantly points to Claude.

                         MARGUERITE
          Roxanne weeps as her mother testifies against Claude.

                         SOLOMON
          What is your relationship to the
          accused?

                         MARGUERITE
          I am his mother.

                         SOLOMON
          And where is his father?

                         MARGUERITE
          I don't know, sir.

                         SOLOMON
          Well, what is his name?
          She pauses. The crowd eyes her, disapproving. A beat.

                         MARGUERITE
          I never learned his name, sir.

                         SOLOMON
          You say a man whose name you
          cannot recall is the father of
          your child? What can you tell us
          about him?

                         MARGUERITE
          Not much, sir.
          She lowers her eyes, ashamed. Solomon considers her.

                         SOLOMON
          Almost as if it were a dream?
          (off her look)
          Certain devils called incubi can
          collect human semen and then
          transfer it to women as they
          sleep. A woman who unwittingly
          conceives in this manner would not
          be a whore. She would be
          blameless in the eyes of God.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         CONTINUED:
          Marguerite's eyes spark, suddenly hopeful...

                         SOLOMON
          You remember almost nothing of the
          man who impregnated you. Is it
          not possible that there was no
          man? That the accused is not the
          product of your own sin, but the
          foul offspring of a werewolf whose
          semen was placed in you by an
          incubus while you slept?

                         MARGUERITE
          Yes! Yes, I remember now! He
          came to me in my sleep! It wasn't
          my fault! God save me, it wasn't
          my fault!
          Roxanne buries her face in her hands.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY (LATER)

          Solomon addresses the gathered Villagers.

                         SOLOMON
          We have proven here today that
          behind this veil of feigned idiocy
          is the fiend that has plagued your
          village. However, in order for
          the sentence of death to be
          carried out, the Church requires
          either a confession or the
          testimony of a witness who has
          seen the accused in his
          transformed state. Since the
          accused has refused to confess,
          this court calls upon its final
          witness. Isabelle Ordeville.
          Isabelle is stunned. All eyes turn toward her.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY (TIMECUT)

          Isabelle stands before Solomon. Claude waves. She
          ignores him.

                         SOLOMON
          On the night of the last full
          moon, you were attacked by the
          Wolf. You looked it in the eye.
          And the one thing a werewolf can
          never change is its eyes.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         CONTINUED:
          He gestures to the Soldiers. They grab Claude and force
          him to look at her.

                         SOLOMON
          Look into his eyes, my child. Do
          you see the beast in them?
          Isabelle gives Claude a pitying look. Solomon watches,
          expectant. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          It isn't him. It can't be. He
          was with us when the Wolf
          attacked.
          Solomon is taken aback. Surprised MURMURS in the room.

                         SOLOMON
          Is this true? Is there another
          here who can speak to this?

                         ROXANNE
          I can! It's true! I saw him!

                         LUCRECE
          She's his sister! She'll say
          anything!
          The suspicious Villagers agree. Roxanne gives Isabelle a
          desperate look. Then Isabelle spots the Carpenter.

                         ISABELLE
          He was there! He carried Claude
          away! He saved his life!
          Suddenly, all eyes are on the Carpenter. He shrinks
          back. He glances at his WIFE. She stares at him. Hard.

                         CARPENTER
          She is mistaken. I did no such
          thing.
          Isabelle is shocked. She looks to the other Villagers,
          but no one will speak up. Solomon frowns.

                         SOLOMON
          Very well. Since no one here can
          bear witness, we must extort a
          confession. This court shall
          reconvene tomorrow at dawn.
          Solomon leaves. Claude is dragged out of the room by
          Soldiers. Isabelle gives Grandmother a helpless look.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle and Grandmother sit at the table. Cesaire is in
          the other room feeding Suzette.

                         ISABELLE
          Why wouldn't Father Solomon listen
          to me? Doesn't he care that
          Claude isn't guilty?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          He'd rather let an innocent boy
          die than risk letting the Wolf go
          free.

                         ISABELLE
          But the Wolf is free. And the
          moon will be full in two days.
          The full weight of this hits home. Grandmother leans
          close, lowers her voice.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          We both know it will be coming for
          you. You must leave here tomorrow
          and never return.
          A long beat. Isabelle reluctantly shakes her head.

                         ISABELLE
          I cannot leave.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You have no choice. The
          alternative is unthinkable.

                         ISABELLE
          What is unthinkable is that I
          should be responsible for the
          deaths of everyone that I love.
          I'd rather spend a lifetime of
          misery than let that happen.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          The Wolf's sins are on its own
          twice-damned soul, not yours.

                         ISABELLE
          But what if it was you it wanted?
          Would you go with it to save me?
          Or would you leave me to die?
          Grandmother doesn't have a fast answer for that.
          Suddenly, a HIDEOUS, INARTICULATE SCREAM echoes in the
          night. Isabelle and Grandmother exchange a grave look.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Grandmother and Isabelle step outside, followed by
          Cesaire. The SCREAMING can be heard more clearly.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Father Solomon. Extorting his
          confession.
          Claude's screams sending chills down their spines.

                         CESAIRE
          You should have condemned him
          today. At least it would have
          been quick.
          Cesaire turns and goes back inside. Isabelle and
          Grandmother continue to listen.

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Roxanne weeps with her hands clamped around her ears,
          trying to block out the SCREAMING. Her mother sits by
          the fire as if nothing unusual is going on.

                         ROXANNE
          How can you just sit there and
          listen to this?
          Marguerite ignores her. Furious, Roxanne stands up and
          grabs Marguerite's coin purse.

                         MARGUERITE
          Where are you going with that?
          Roxanne doesn't answer, just pulls on her cloak.
          Marguerite grabs her, but Roxanne turns and shoves her to
          the ground. Marguerite starts to get up, but Roxanne
          snatches a knife from off the table and points it at her.

                         ROXANNE
          Don't you touch me again. Ever.
          Roxanne angrily throws the knife aside and leaves.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - NIGHT

          A fire burns underneath a 'Brazen Bull,' a hollow, life-
          size bull made of brass. The fire heats the metal to
          almost red-hot. Claude's screams come from inside it.
          Solomon glowers, frustrated. Attewater looks sick.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Enough of this. Let's eat.
          He gestures to the Scribe, who hands Attewater a
          document.

                         ATTEWATER
          What is this?

                         SOLOMON
          A statement declaring that you
          heard the boy confess. All it
          requires is your signature. Or
          your mark, if you cannot write.

                         ATTEWATER
          But he has not confessed. How
          could he have?
          Solomon studies Attewater. A beat. Solomon shrugs.

                         SOLOMON
          Very well. Listen more carefully
          this time.
          He gestures for the Soldiers to throw more wood on the
          fire. The FLAMES leap higher. Attewater goes pale. All
          he hears are screams. Solomon stands next to the bull.
          The flames gleam off the brass, casting him in hellfire.

                         SOLOMON
          Listen to how he sings of his love
          of Satan. How he despairs that he
          will never again copulate with the
          dead or sink his teeth into the
          flesh of pregnant women and eat
          their unborn children.
          Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look, suddenly
          realizing. Father Solomon is insane.

                         ATTEWATER
          Stop this.

                         SOLOMON
          No. You stop it.
          (off his look)
          We both know he is guilty. But I
          cannot legally execute him without
          a witness or a confession. Sign
          this and we have a confession.
          Attewater glares at Solomon, then angrily signs the
          document. Solomon gestures to his Soldiers, who open the
          bull and pull Claude out. Attewater has to look away.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Suddenly, Solomon grabs Attewater by his collar, drags
          him across the room, and forces him to look at Claude.
          Thankfully, we do not see him, except in deep f.g. His
          naked flesh is actually smoking. Attewater cringes.

                         SOLOMON
          This is the business of werewolf
          hunting and you had best develop a
          stomach for it. Because where
          there is one werewolf, there are
          two. And where there are two,
          there are more.

                         (BEAT)
          This is only the beginning.
          Solomon throws him to the floor and leaves. Attewater
          trembles helplessly as Claude is dragged out of the room.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          Solomon is eating dinner. The Captain enters.

                         CAPTAIN
          A girl to see you.

                         SOLOMON
          Well, I've yet to come across a
          girl I wouldn't at least look at.
          The Captain ushers Roxanne inside. She meekly steps
          forward. A beat.

                         SOLOMON
          I assume you came here with a
          purpose.
          She hurriedly empties Marguerite's purse on the table in
          front of Solomon. A mere handful of coins.

                         ROXANNE
          I would like to bargain for the
          release of my brother.

                         SOLOMON
          Your brother has just confessed.

                         ROXANNE
          What? That's not possible!

                         SOLOMON
          It has been witnessed and
          notarized. He will hang in the
          morning.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         CONTINUED:
          Roxanne stands frozen, gathering her courage for what she
          is about to say. Realizing that she has no choice.

                         ROXANNE
          I have more than money to offer
          you.
          She raises a trembling hand and starts to open her
          bodice, but Solomon interrupts.

                         SOLOMON
          What do you think you are doing?
          (off her look)
          Do you have any idea who I am? I
          am the Witchfinder General. I
          have fought in the Holy Land. I
          have waded hip deep in blood and
          resisted all the temptations of
          the infidels. And you seek to
          stay the hand of justice with such
          a tawdry bribe? Leave here, girl,
          before I have you whipped.
          Solomon gestures for the Soldiers and they forcibly drag
          her away. Roxanne struggles against them.

                         ROXANNE
          Wait! I have something else! I
          know the name of a witch!
          Solomon looks up sharply. The Soldiers stop. Solomon
          crosses the room and stands glaring down at Roxanne. She
          cringes. This is the hardest decision of her life...

                         ROXANNE
          Spare my brother and I will tell
          you her name.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          SMASH! Isabelle and her parents are jolted from their
          sleep by Soldiers barging into their home. One of them
          climbs into the loft and yanks Isabelle out of bed.
          Cesaire leaps to his feet, but is viciously beaten down.
          Suzette screams. The Soldiers drag Isabelle away.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT

          Isabelle is thrown to the floor, the door SLAMMED behind
          her. She huddles against the wall, shivering.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         CONTINUED:
          Then: A low MOAN in the dark. Isabelle startles. She
          looks up, her eyes going wide in disgust and horror...
          It's Claude. He's locked in a man-shaped cage, his body
          covered with hideous burns. He moans again. Isabelle
          chokes back her disgust and goes to him. She lightly
          takes his hand, shaken to her soul at the sight of him.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY

          The chamber is full again. Cesaire, Grandmother,
          Prudence, and Henri are here. Peter sits in the last
          row. Isabelle is in the seat of the accused. Roxanne
          stands witness. She's trying not to look at Isabelle.

                         SOLOMON
          How are you acquainted with the
          accused?

                         ROXANNE
          We were friends.

                         SOLOMON
          And how long did this friendship
          last?

                         ROXANNE
          All my life.

                         SOLOMON
          And in this time, have you ever
          known the accused to converse with
          devils?

                         ROXANNE
          Yes, Your Eminence. On the night
          of the last full moon, she talked
          to the werewolf. And later she
          told me that it also talked to
          her.
          Isabelle gives Grandmother a frightened look. Cesaire
          clenches his fist. Solomon turns to Isabelle.

                         SOLOMON
          What of this? Do you deny having
          conversed with a werewolf?
          She looks to Roxanne, who trembles with emotion. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          No. I do not deny it.
          The crowd REACTS. Solomon quiets them with a look.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         CONTINUED:

                         SOLOMON
          Describe this encounter.

                         ISABELLE
          It spoke, just as a man speaks.

                         SOLOMON
          And what was the nature of your
          conversation with it?
          Isabelle hesitates. Grandmother holds her breath.

                         ISABELLE
          It told me... It promised to
          leave here and never return. But
          only if I leave with it.
          Roxanne gives her a stunned look. A heavy silence falls
          over the room. Even Solomon is surprised. Then:

                         REEVE
          But who is it? Make her tell us
          who the werewolf is!

                         ISABELLE
          I don't know! I swear I don't
          know!

                         MERCHANT
          It doesn't matter who it is
          anymore. It wants her, not us.
          Let's just give it what it wants.
          A long, tense beat. Heavy silence. Nobody speaks.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          We should not allow ourselves to
          even consider this.

                         REEVE
          I think we already are.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          What's the matter with you? You
          know her. You all know her.

                         REEVE
          Do we? Did we know she could talk
          to werewolves?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          She could have run away. She
          could saved herself, but she
          stayed here because she cares more
          about you than she does herself.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Peter reacts. He and Isabelle exchange a look. Now he
          understands...

                         MERCHANT
          If she stayed, she did so because
          she is in league with it. Let
          this be her punishment.
          The crowd loudly AGREES. Solomon considers. Grandmother
          gives Attewater a dark look. Then:

                         SOLOMON
          Very well. Isabelle Ordeville, in
          light of your willing confession,
          it is the decision of this court
          that on the night of the next full
          moon, you be left to the mercy of
          the werewolf.
          Cesaire silently buries his face in his hands.

                         HENRI
          No!
          Henri bursts to his feet, turning heads. Isabelle is led
          away. Roxanne can only watch, helpless and ashamed.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAY

          Lucrece has drawn a small crowd around the well.
          Prudence pauses to hear what she's saying...

                         LUCRECE
          The first victim was her sister.
          The second was her fiancÃ©e's
          father. Then Rosemaria, who
          everyone knows she hated. And
          don't forget her mother, with half
          her face missing. All this death
          around one girl...
          Prudence has heard enough. She turns away.

          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DUSK

          Roxanne approaches. The Captain eyes her, questioning.

                         ROXANNE
          I'm here for my brother.
          He gestures. Roxanne turns... and sees Claude's body
          dangling from a makeshift gallows. He's been hanged.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         CONTINUED:
          Roxanne falls to her knees. The rope around Claude's
          neck CREAKS as his body sways in the wind.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - NIGHT

          Isabelle stands at the barred door. Grandmother is on
          the other side. They speak in furtive whispers.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          I'm not going to let these
          worthless shits sacrifice you to
          save themselves. We have to find
          the real werewolf before tomorrow
          night.

                         ISABELLE
          That's impossible. Even Father
          Solomon doesn't have the first
          clue.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Father Solomon doesn't know the
          things that I know.
          (off Isabelle's look)
          I am the oldest person in this
          village who was here when the Wolf
          first came. I remember the old
          days. And what is happening now
          is much worse.

                         ISABELLE
          What was it like in the old days?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          The Wolf never used to attack in
          the open like it did at the
          festival. It's a coward at heart.
          It would kill whole families in
          their homes, but it always stayed
          in the shadows. It never would
          have shown itself in the old days.

                         ISABELLE
          It's grown bold.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Or perhaps it made a mistake.

                         (BEAT)
          You're at the center of this. At
          least two of the victims can be
          tied to you. What if it had to
          kill so many at the festival to
          hide the fact that the first two
          killings weren't random?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle considers this. A beat as she realizes...

                         ISABELLE
          But who would want to kill Lucie?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Your parents said that the Wolf
          broke into the house and took
          Lucie. We both know that's not
          true. What really happened?
          Isabelle hesitates, reluctant.

                         ISABELLE
          My mother made me swear I would
          never speak of it.

                         (BEAT)
          Lucie went to the Wolf willingly.
          Grandmother reacts, horrified.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Why would you think such a thing?

                         ISABELLE
          She was in love with Henri.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          She took her own life over a boy?

                         ISABELLE
          What other explanation is there?
          Grandmother thinks. The pieces are fitting together...

          EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

          Grandmother knocks on a door. Henri answers.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Hello, Henri.

          INT. STABLE - NIGHT

          Henri is in the midst of shoeing a horse. Grandmother
          stands by the door, watching him.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You spoke up very loudly in
          Isabelle's defense today. That
          was very brave.

                         HENRI
          I just said what I felt.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You're under no obligation to
          stand in her defense. You broke
          off your engagement to her.

                         HENRI
          I never stopped caring about her.
          I would do anything for Isabelle.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          As her sister would have done
          anything for you.
          (off his look)
          Lucie was in love with you. But
          you knew that, didn't you?

                         HENRI
          I had no control over the way she
          felt.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          She kept it secret from almost
          everyone. Even Isabelle didn't
          know. Did you tell anyone?

                         HENRI
          Never.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Not even your father?

                         HENRI
          I didn't have to tell him.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          So he knew your secrets, did he?
          Henri picks up a hammer and goes back to work. Angrily
          nailing a shoe to the horse's foot. BANG! BANG! BANG!

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You were the only one who could
          have lured Lucie out on the Wolf's
          night. And none of the men who
          went hunting for the Wolf remember
          seeing you after the sun set on
          the night your father died.
          Henri faces her, clutching the hammer...

                         HENRI
          Why are you doing this?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         CONTINUED: (2)

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Because I want you to confess.
          You killed Lucie. And your
          father. And God only knows how
          many others. And if you won't
          admit it, then I will tell Father
          Solomon and we will lock you up
          until the moon rises tomorrow
          night and you can no longer hide
          your guilt.
          As she says this, a slow look of dawning realization
          comes over him. Realization and horror.

                         HENRI
          It's you.
          Henri steps closer to her, menacing. Grandmother steps
          back and finds herself bumping against the closed door.

                         HENRI
          My God, it's you. You're the
          Wolf. I can smell it on you now.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Smell what? What are you talking
          about?

                         HENRI
          The night my father died. I saw
          the Wolf pass by, dragging him by
          the neck. I was so terrified I
          couldn't move or make a sound. I
          remember every detail of that
          moment. The way the moonlight
          gleamed off the Wolf's coat. The
          soundless way it moved. I even
          remember the way it smelled. A
          thick, greasy, musky stink.

                         (BEAT)
          And I can smell it on you right
          now.
          A beat. They stand frozen. Glaring at one another.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You accuse me and I'll bring you
          down with me. All they can do is
          take my life. You have more to
          lose.

                         HENRI
          But who do you think they'll
          believe? I'm the blacksmith.

                         CONTINUED: (3)

                         HENRI (CONT'D)
          They know me. You're the crazy
          old woman who lives in the woods.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Then I'll have to prove it.

                         HENRI
          Unless you can, you'd best keep
          your mouth shut.
          Another beat. A stand-off. Grandmother's hand finds the
          door handle. She turns it, stumbling outside --

          EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

          -- and practically runs right into Cesaire. She
          startles, gives him a surprised, flustered look.

                         CESAIRE
          Are you ready for me to take you
          home?
          She looks back. Henri stands in the doorway, still
          holding the hammer. She eyes him, measuring, suddenly
          hesitant. Cesaire gives them both an uncertain look.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Cesaire and Grandmother ride in a horse-drawn cart. The
          moon is almost full. Up ahead, Grandmother sees Prudence
          with a group of Villagers listening to Lucrece.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Stop the cart.
          Cesaire pulls the reins. Grandmother calls out:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Prudence, come with me. I have
          some blankets I want you to mend
          for Father Auguste.
          Prudence sighs and climbs up into the cart.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          The cart stops out front. Grandmother turns to Prudence.

                         GRANDMOTHER
          You take these blankets to Father
          Auguste the moment you're
          finished. Understand?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         PRUDENCE
          All right.
          Cesaire helps Grandmother out of the cart.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Grandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets.
          He has tears in his eyes.

                         CESAIRE
          Will you want a ride into town
          tomorrow? To say goodbye to her?

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Yes. First thing in the morning.
          He nods shakily and leaves. She closes the door behind
          him and lets the faÃ§ade of calm fall from her face. She
          puts a trembling hand to her mouth, mind racing...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DAWN

          The Villagers go about their daily activities, but nobody
          speaks. The Herald hangs the full moon sign.

                         HERALD
          Full moon! Full moon! Full moon!

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAWN

          Morning sunlight glints off the frozen brook. A flock of
          CROWS are startled from their roosts and take flight.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DAWN

          Grandmother sits at the table, writing a letter in Latin
          with a quill. She doesn't notice the veil that separates
          her bedchamber rippling, as if in a gentle breeze...
          Suddenly, she hears MOVEMENT. She looks up. The veil is
          still. She stands and pokes the ashes of the fire with
          her cane, her back to the veil...
          ... and changes her grip on the cane. To wield it as a
          weapon. Glancing back, she sees the veil move again...
          Suddenly, she whirls around and swings her cane at the
          veil, sweeping through it three times without hitting
          anything. A beat.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         CONTINUED:

                         GRANDMOTHER
          Show yourself! Coward!
          Another beat. The veil settles and is still. Then:
          A FIGURE lunges out of the veil with its arms reaching
          out at us. It grabs Grandmother's throat in one hand and
          wrestles the cane from her grip with the other.
          She struggles, but she's far too weak for her attacker.
          The Figure whips out a knife. Grandmother sees it, but
          can do nothing. The knife flashes.
          Fat drops of blood splash on the floor. Then the Figure
          drops Grandmother and she crumples, lifeless. A pool of
          blood slowly spreads out from underneath her.
          The Figure steps over the widening pool and picks up the
          letter Grandmother was writing. He quickly scans it and
          angrily tosses it in the fire...
          Then he hears something. FOOTSTEPS, crunching through
          the snow. He hurries to the window and peers out...
          It's Roxanne and Prudence. Roxanne looks like hell, but
          here for lessons as usual. The Figure ducks out of
          sight. A moment later, they're KNOCKING on the door.
          Their feet are visible under the crack.
          The Figure sidles alongside the door, BREATHING heavily.
          Another KNOCK. On the floor inside, the pool of blood is
          expanding toward the door...
          The Figure sees it. He puts a hand on the hilt of his
          knife... then whispers to the girls through the door,
          disguising his voice with a dry, old woman's rasp:

                         THE FIGURE
          Go away.
          Outside, Roxanne and Prudence exchange a curious look.

                         PRUDENCE
          Are you all right?

                         THE FIGURE
          I'm sick. You can't come in.

                         PRUDENCE
          You sound awful. Would you like
          us to make you something?

                         THE FIGURE
          No. You mustn't come in. Go
          home, now. I want to sleep.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          The blood is flowing right toward the door. In about
          thirty seconds, the girls will be standing in it.
          Outside, Prudence and Roxanne exchange a look...
          ... then turn and walk away. The Figure breathes a sigh
          of relief and takes his hand away from the knife.
          But then Roxanne stops. And looks back. The Figure
          secretly watches from the window.
          Roxanne walks back to the cottage. The blood is about to
          run under the door. The Figure grabs the door handle and
          readies the knife. Roxanne stands on the doorstep.

                         ROXANNE
          Are you sure you don't want us to
          bring you something?

                         THE FIGURE
          No, my dear. Come back tomorrow.
          The blood is seconds away from hitting her feet. The
          Figure stands poised to throw open the door... but at the
          last instant, Roxanne turns and walks away. She doesn't
          see the blood pour outside under the door behind her.

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON CELL - DAY

          Isabelle has fallen asleep on the bed of straw. She's
          startled awake by the sound of her CELL DOOR opening.
          It's Father Auguste.

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          I've come to hear your final
          confession.
          Isabelle nods shakily and sits up. He enters.

                         ISABELLE
          Has there been any word from my
          grandmother?

                         FATHER AUGUSTE
          None that I have heard. Why?

          not let the girl go free?

                         SOLOMON

          Attewater hurriedly enters and looks around. Nobody here

          of beer in his hand. Attewater goes to Cesaire.

                         ATTEWATER
          Where is your mother?

                         CESAIRE
          I don't know. I went to pick her

                         CONTINUED:
          Attewater reacts, concerned. Cesaire takes another
          drink. Attewater angrily knocks it out of his hand.

                         ATTEWATER
          Stop pouring that swill down your
          gullet listen to me!
          Cesaire emerges from his drunken fog and shoots him a
          dangerous look, but Attewater doesn't shy from it.

                         ATTEWATER
          She was trying to find the
          werewolf. If she figured out who
          it is, I need to know now.
          Suddenly, the door bursts open and the Captain enters,
          flanked by Soldiers. They drag Cesaire to his feet.

                         ATTEWATER
          Wait! What has he done?

                         CAPTAIN
          It's just a precaution. Father
          Solomon doesn't want the girl's
          family interfering.
          Suddenly, Cesaire pulls a club out of his boot and hits
          the Captain across the back, knocking him to his knees.
          Cesaire hits him again, then he's wrestled to the ground.
          The Captain kicks Cesaire in the face and knocks him out.

          What have you done to him?!
          Then: Isabelle's cell is opened. The Captain is holding
          iron manacles. Isabelle looks at them, horrified. The
          Soldiers clap her in irons. This is really happening...

          CESAIRE (O.S.)
          Isabelle...
          He's coming to. Isabelle breaks away from the Soldiers,
          runs to his cell, and holds his hands through the bars.

          I love you so much. Tell Mama and
          Grandmother that I love them.

          I love you, my angel. You don't
          know how much.
          The Soldiers pull Isabelle away and lead her up the
          stairs. Cesaire shakes his cell door with impotent rage.

                         CESAIRE
          Bastards!

          EXT. MANOR HOUSE - DUSK

          Isabelle is chained to the back of Solomon's coach. The
          Captain approaches with a 'humiliation mask': an iron
          mask that locks in place over the head with only tiny
          holes to see out of. This one is shaped to look like a
          wolf's head. Isabelle goes pale at the sight of it...
          ... then the Captain puts it over her head. Inside the
          mask: almost total darkness. The Captain locks it on.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - DUSK

          Solomon's coach lurches through the snow and slush.
          Isabelle trudges along behind it. The Villagers line the
          road to watch as she is dragged stumbling through the
          streets in her horrific iron wolf mask. Lucrece sneers.

                         LUCRECE
          Not so pretty now, is she?
          The Villagers do not answer. Henri is here, silently
          fuming. Prudence stands next to him. She looks around.

                         PRUDENCE
          Where's Peter?

                         HENRI
          I haven't seen him.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK

          Solomon, Attewater, and Father Auguste stand next to the
          stocks. As a crowd of anxious Villagers watches,
          Isabelle is placed in the stocks with the mask still on.

                         SOLOMON
          We, Bailiff Attewater, Father
          Auguste, and Father Solomon of
          Avignon, having in mind that you,

                         SOLOMON (CONT'D)
          Flour, by your own confession,
          have committed acts of vulgar
          heresy, convict you of the sins of
          witches and condemn you to the
          mercy of werewolf. This is the
          sentence given.
          Solomon walks away and Attewater reluctantly follows.
          Through the holes in the mask, Isabelle sees Father
          Auguste make the sign of the cross and sadly turn away.

                         ISABELLE
          Help...
          Father Auguste stops. The Villagers shift uncomfortably
          as her helpless voice calls out from inside the mask.

                         ISABELLE
          Help me... Please... Help me...
          The Villagers start to leave, ashamed. Isabelle sees
          them going... and suddenly SCREAMS.

                         ISABELLE

          HELP ME! PLEASE! WHY WON'T

          SOMEBODY HELP ME?!
          The Villagers startle. She SCREAMS again, struggling
          against the stocks. But no one comes to her aid.

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DUSK

          Isabelle's SCREAMS can be heard from here. Roxanne lies
          in her bed, sobbing her heart out...

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - DUSK (LATER)

          Almost everyone has left. Isabelle slumps in the stocks,
          silent and exhausted. Father Auguste sadly walks away,
          leaving only Prudence. She nervously approaches.

                         PRUDENCE
          Isabelle? Can you hear me?

                         ISABELLE
          I can hear you.

                         PRUDENCE
          Roxanne wanted you to know how
          sorry she is. She only said those
          things to save her brother.

                         PRUDENCE
          Of course.

                         (BEAT)
          I wanted to say... I don't know
          what to say.

                         ISABELLE
          You don't have to say anything.

                         PRUDENCE
          I want to.

                         (BEAT)
          I want you to know that you may
          have fooled Roxanne, but you don't
          fool me. Not anymore. You were
          always too good. Too pretty.
          Nobody could be as perfect as you.
          You tricked us. And now you're
          going to get what you deserve.
          A beat. Isabelle responds, surprisingly gentle:

                         ISABELLE
          I think you'd better go now.
          Prudence looks up. The sun has almost set.

                         PRUDENCE
          Yes. It won't be long now.

          ACROSS THE SQUARE
          The Captain crouches in the shadows of a nearby barn. He
          watches Prudence leave. Solomon and Attewater join him.

                         SOLOMON
          No one shoots until I give the
          order.
          Attewater glances outside and sees Soldiers armed with
          longbows hidden all around the square. The Captain draws
          an arrow from his quiver. It's tip is made of silver.

          EXT. VILLAGE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

          The streets are empty. The FULL MOON has risen...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Isabelle is now alone. The streets are empty. Around
          the square, Soldiers stand in tense silence, ready with
          arrows strung on their bows. Attewater shifts nervously.
          Suddenly: a long, ululating HOWL. Isabelle gasps. The
          Soldiers ready their bows. Attewater shrinks back.
          Another HOWL. Closer now. Isabelle tries to pull her
          hands out of the stocks. Then: Solomon spots something.

                         SOLOMON
          There.
          The Captain and Attewater follow his look. A BLACK SHAPE
          is stealing through the shadows toward Isabelle...

                         SOLOMON
          Hold your fire...
          Isabelle frantically tries to free herself, her wrists
          torn and bleeding, but it's no use. Then, suddenly --
          -- something SLAMS into the stocks. BANG! She can't see
          what it is. The stocks are hit again. Isabelle screams.
          Suddenly, the Shape moves into her field of view:

          HENRI (O.S.)
          Hey! Stop it! It's me!
          Isabelle's eyes go wide. The Black Shape crouches and
          looks in at Isabelle through the eyeholes. It's Henri.

                         ISABELLE
          Get away from me!

                         HENRI
          I'm not the Wolf! The moon is
          out! Look, I haven't turned!
          Isabelle realizes. He's right. It couldn't be him.

                         HENRI
          I'm trying to get you out of this.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes! Yes, please hurry!
          Solomon and his men watch as Henri uses a hammer and
          chisel to break open the stocks. BANG! BANG!

                         CAPTAIN
          He's going to free her.
          Then: another HOWL. Almost on top of them.

                         SOLOMON
          Patience. It's close now...
          Henri brings the hammer down again and again and -- BANG!
          The lock is cleaved in two. Henri throws the stock open
          and helps Isabelle out of the mask. She looks like hell.

                         HENRI
          Can you stand?
          Isabelle nods. In the loft:

                         SOLOMON
          Kill him.
          Attewater gives Solomon a horrified look. The Captain
          strings an arrow and draws it back, taking aim...
          Suddenly, Attewater pushes him aside, spoiling the shot.
          The arrow whizzes by Henri's head. Attewater calls out:

                         ATTEWATER

          RUN!
          Isabelle and Henri see him -- just as Solomon plunges a
          dagger into his back. Henri drags Isabelle to her feet
          and they run away, arrows ZIPPING all around them.
          Solomon scowls as he watches them escape.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Henri leads Isabelle as they run through the village.

                         HENRI
          We have to get to the stable.
          Peter left his cart for us.

                         ISABELLE
          Peter? Where is he --?

                         HENRI
          It doesn't matter. Come on!

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          The Captain and his Soldiers have picked up a few
          followers. They're raising the alarm. A MOB is forming.

                         CAPTAIN
          The witch has escaped! The witch
          has escaped!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          EXT. STABLE - NIGHT

          Henri leads Isabelle around the back and helps her into a
          cart that is waiting for them and unhitches the horse.

          EXT. VILLAGE - ROAD - NIGHT

          Henri and Isabelle take off through the village in the
          cart... but then they hear a HOWL behind them.
          They look back. The Wolf emerges from the darkness,
          chasing after them. Henri whips the horse, urging it to
          go faster. They start to pull away from the Wolf, but
          then it veers off into the village and disappears.

                         HENRI
          It's gone.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't think so...
          Just then, they pass by the Reeve and a group of
          Villagers. The Villagers start to give chase, but
          Isabelle and Henri quickly leave them behind.
          Meanwhile, the Wolf is shortcutting through the village,
          racing after the cart. It comes to a sheep pen and
          smashes through it. It comes to a large barn and leaps
          onto its roof, then leaps off again --
          -- and lands within striking distance of the cart. Henri
          drives the horse, but it's no use. The Wolf lunges,
          wrestling the horse to the ground. The horse cries out,
          its body twisting as it falls, sending the cart flying.
          Isabelle falls out and lands hard. Henri lies on his
          side, clutching his wrist. Isabelle pulls herself
          together and goes to him. She looks at his arm. It's
          visibly broken. She helps him to his feet --
          -- just as the overturned cart is SMASHED apart. The
          Wolf bursts through it, breaking it to pieces. It glares
          at them with bloodthirsty eyes.
          Isabelle and Henri back away from it, but their escape is
          blocked -- the Villagers have caught up. They freeze at
          the sight of the Wolf, but stand their ground. Isabelle
          and Henri are trapped. The Reeve shouts:

                         REEVE
          Take her! Take her and leave us
          in peace!
          The Wolf SNARLS at him and turns to Isabelle.

                         CONTINUED:

                         THE WOLF
          You can't outrun me, my dear. And
          there is no place you can hide
          that I cannot smell you out.

                         (BEAT)
          So what is your decision? Will
          you take your place with me?

                         ISABELLE
          My place will never be with you.

                         THE WOLF
          Where do you belong then? Here?
          With the cowards who so gladly
          sacrificed you to save themselves?

                         ISABELLE
          They're still good people.

                         THE WOLF
          They are sheep. We are not like
          them. Let me show you what you
          are.
          The Wolf steps closer... but suddenly, Henri pushes
          Isabelle aside, pulls his hammer from his belt, and
          raises it to hit the Wolf.

                         HENRI
          Get away from her!
          The Reeve quickly grabs him. Henri struggles futilely,
          but Isabelle seizes the distraction. She snatches a
          Villager's torch and jabs it into the Wolf's side. The
          Wolf leaps back with an eerily human YELP of pain.
          Before it can react, Isabelle waves the torch at the
          Villagers, grabs Henri and they run away.
          The mob chases after them. Three Soldiers appear and
          join the mob. Figures silhouetted against the snow,
          angry faces lit by torchlight. It's like a nightmare.
          Suddenly, a cottage in front of the mob EXPLODES into
          pieces and the Wolf bursts out of it. It turns on the
          Villagers and Soldiers. It picks up a fallen roof beam
          in its powerful jaws, clenches them, trembling with rage,
          and snaps the wooden beam in half like a twig.
          The Villagers run away in fear, but the Soldiers stand
          their ground and the Wolf attacks.
          Meanwhile, Isabelle and Henri escape... but there are
          more Soldiers up ahead. Isabelle and Henri quickly hide.

          (off Isabelle's look)
          Your grandmother is the Wolf.
          Isabelle recoils in disbelief. She shakes her head.

                         ISABELLE
          The Wolf is a man. It told me.

                         HENRI
          You believe it?
          Isabelle hesitates. He has a point. Henri peers out.
          The Soldiers are closing in on them...

                         HENRI
          They're coming.

                         ISABELLE
          Follow me.
          She takes his hand and leads him away.

          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle knocks at the door. Roxanne answers. She gives
          Isabelle a stunned look.

                         ISABELLE
          We need to come inside. Quickly.

          INT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Henri enter. Roxanne shuts the door.
          Marguerite gasps when she sees Isabelle.

                         MARGUERITE
          Have you lost your mind? If they
          find her here, they'll kill us,
          too!

                         ROXANNE
          Then shut up so they don't find
          her.

                         HENRI
          We have to get out of town.

                         ROXANNE
          You'll never make it. You can
          hide here until morning.

                         ISABELLE
          They're searching everywhere. We
          have to keep moving.

                         ROXANNE
          You might make it to the church.
          Even the king cannot violate the
          protection of sanctuary.

                         HENRI
          And the Wolf cannot cross onto
          holy ground.
          The three exchange a look. Sounds like a plan.

                         ISABELLE
          Can we go out your back window?
          Roxanne nods. They hurry toward the window, but then:

                         ROXANNE
          Wait! I have an idea.

          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          A group of Villagers walks by. As they do, the Reeve
          hears something coming from behind the cottage...

          HENRI (O.S.)
          Come on!
          The Reeve follows the voice and sees two figures that
          look like Henri and Isabelle climb out the back window.

                         REEVE
          They're here! Over here!
          The two figures run and the Villagers chase after them.

          EXT. VILLAGE - FIELD - NIGHT

          Henri and Isabelle hide behind a shed, just as the
          Villagers appear and spread out, trying to find them.
          Henri turns to Isabelle... only it's not Isabelle. It's
          Roxanne wearing Isabelle's clothes.

                         HENRI
          Can you keep going?

                         ROXANNE
          I can if you can.
          They run off, chased by the Villagers.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          EXT. ROXANNE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle climbs out the back window undetected, dressed
          in Roxanne's clothes. The coast is clear. She runs off.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

          Isabelle can see the church steeple over the rooftops and
          races toward it. But then she hears a low GROWL ahead of
          her. Dark eyes peer from an open barn door. She turns
          and runs down an alley. The Wolf chases after her.
          As Isabelle nears the end of the alley, the Wolf suddenly
          appears in front of her, blocking her path. She races
          back the way she came, then darts into a gap between two
          outbuildings, barely big enough for her to pass through,
          too narrow for the Wolf to follow.
          But as she runs, she hears a LOUD CLAMORING above her.
          The Wolf is chasing her on the roof of one of the
          buildings. It's right over her. It shoves its head
          through the narrow space above her, SNAPPING its jaws,
          but can't quite reach her. Then suddenly --
          -- the gap between the buildings closes further and the
          Wolf is stopped short, choking, its head caught in the
          narrow space. But Isabelle slips through, emerges from
          between the buildings, and is startled by a VOICE:

          CAPTAIN (O.S.)
          There!
          The Captain is pointing at her. He has another Soldier
          with him. Isabelle runs. They chase after her...
          ... just as the Wolf frees itself. From the rooftop, it
          sees the Soldiers chasing Isabelle. It races after them,
          running across roofs and jumping from cottage to cottage.
          Isabelle runs into an alley that dead-ends at a low wall.
          There's firewood piled against the wall and Isabelle
          quickly scrabbles up it, but at the last second --
          -- the Captain reaches out and grabs her ankle. She
          grabs a log and hits him over the head until he lets go.
          Then she jumps down to the other side.
          The other Soldier starts to climb after her, but is
          suddenly lifted right off his feet. The Captain looks
          up. The Wolf is standing on the adjacent roof and has
          picked the Soldier up in its jaws. It glares down at the
          Captain. It flings the Soldier in its mouth away like a
          dirty sock. The Captain gapes up at it in fear for a
          moment too long and then the Wolf is on him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          EXT. VILLAGE - SQUARE - NIGHT

          Isabelle's route has taken her right back to where she
          started. She spots the steeple and starts toward it...
          But there is someone here. Father Solomon. He's holding
          his silver sword. Isabelle freezes. For a moment, they
          just stand there, looking at one another. Then --
          Isabelle turns to run. Solomon is on her in an instant.
          He grabs a fistful of her hair and throws her to the
          ground. She tries to get away, but he puts a knee in her
          back and ties her hands together with a length of rope.

                         SOLOMON
          At least you won't die alone now.
          Your friends will all hang with
          you.
          Suddenly... a long, hideous SNARL. Behind them. Father
          Solomon turns. Isabelle cranes her neck and sees... the
          Wolf emerge from the alley she just came out of. Solomon
          picks up his sword and stands to face it.

                         SOLOMON
          If you come for her, you come
          through me.
          The Wolf GROWLS and raises its hackles. Solomon raises
          his sword. Just then, Henri and Roxanne run into the
          square, followed by a group of Villagers.

                         SOLOMON
          Stay back!
          Henri hurries to Isabelle's side. The Villagers watch,
          breathless, as Solomon and the Wolf circle one another.
          Solomon's sword starts to tremble. Sweat breaks out on
          his brow. The Wolf SNARLS with an almost mocking leer.
          Then, with a loud battle cry, Solomon charges. The Wolf
          leaps at him. Solomon raises his sword...
          ... and the Wolf's jaws clamp onto his wrist. Solomon
          screams. The Villagers watch, horrified, as the Wolf
          twists back and forth, like a dog with a chew toy --
          -- biting off Solomon's hand. The hand falls into the
          snow, still clutching the silver sword. Solomon cries
          out in agony. The Wolf turns toward Isabelle and SNARLS.

                         THE WOLF
          There is your mighty werewolf
          hunter. Who will save you now?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle trembles. The Wolf slowly steps toward her,
          menacing... and is struck in the head with a rock. The
          Wolf stops, surprised to find Henri standing in its way.
          Henri picks up another rock and throws it.

                         HENRI
          You bastard! You killed my
          father!

                         ISABELLE
          Henri, what are you doing?

                         HENRI
          I'm not letting it take you.
          He throws another rock and another. One hits the Wolf in
          the eye, tearing a gash in its face. The Wolf GROWLS.

                         HENRI
          Look! It bleeds! We can kill it
          if we stand together!
          The Villagers waver. Henri beseeches them:

                         HENRI
          Father Solomon was one man. His
          soldiers were mercenaries. But we
          are a village!
          The Wolf SNARLS at him, but comes no closer.

                         ISABELLE
          He's right. It's a coward at
          heart. Look at it. Why doesn't
          it attack?
          The Wolf SNARLS louder and takes a step toward her... but
          then the Merchant picks up a rock and throws it.

                         MERCHANT
          You killed my daughter!
          Then another Villager joins them. The Wolf looks around.
          Villagers are emerging from the shadows all around it.
          It's surrounded. And not by a dozen soldiers, but by a
          solid wall of angry, determined men and women.
          The Wolf raises its hackles, trying to scare them, but
          they start closing in, jabbing at it with weapons and
          farm implements. It snaps and SNARLS at its attackers,
          but there are too many of them.
          Someone drives a spear into the Wolf and it screams in
          agony. It lurches around, biting at the spear, but can't
          reach it. Then Henri sees something in the snow...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         CONTINUED: (2)
          Solomon's sword. He pries it out of Solomon's severed
          hand and turns to face the Wolf, the angry Villagers
          gathered behind them. The Wolf trembles, blood dripping
          from its many wounds... then it turns to Isabelle.

                         THE WOLF
          I will come for you again.
          And with that, it turns and flees into the night. The
          Villagers CHEER. The Reeve chases after it and the rest
          of the angry mob follows him. Henri turns to Isabelle.

                         HENRI
          Are you all right?
          Isabelle nods, shaky. Then...

          SOLOMON (O.S.)
          This isn't over.
          They turn. Solomon kneels, holding his bloody stump.

                         SOLOMON
          I am bitten.
          Henri and Isabelle exchange a look. A long beat. Henri
          walks over to Solomon, sword in hand. Solomon crosses
          himself and closes his eyes, unafraid. Roxanne turns
          away. Isabelle doesn't.
          Then Henri swings the sword. There is a soft THUMP as
          Solomon's head hits the snow. Henri throws the sword
          aside. Isabelle puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - DAY

          Isabelle awakens in her bed. She looks around. She's
          still dressed in Roxanne's clothes from the night before.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - COMMON ROOM - DAY

          Isabelle enters to find Suzette putting food in a basket.
          Suzette stops when she sees Isabelle and gives her a hug.

                         ISABELLE
          It's past noon.

                         SUZETTE
          I know. I didn't want to wake
          you.
          Isabelle smiles up at her. The wounds on Suzette's face
          are still bad, but healing. She's scarred for life.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         CONTINUED:

                         ISABELLE
          Where's Father?

                         SUZETTE
          He'll be home soon. They have no
          reason to hold him any longer.

                         ISABELLE
          Did they catch the Wolf?

                         SUZETTE
          No. They lost it in the forest.
          This gives Isabelle pause. A beat. Then:

                         ISABELLE
          What about Grandmother?
          Suzette hesitates. Isabelle is suddenly concerned.

                         SUZETTE
          Roxanne came by. She said your
          grandmother has fallen ill. I was
          hoping you could look in on her.
          Off Isabelle's troubled look...

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY

          Isabelle walks through the village wearing Lucie's red
          riding hood and carrying a basket of food. People lower
          their eyes as she passes. She spots Prudence gossiping
          with Lucrece. Prudence sees her, then looks away.
          The same pup we saw at the beginning is now a grown dog.
          It playfully follows Isabelle along the path, but stops
          as she enters the dark, fog-shrouded forest...

          EXT. DARK FOREST - PATH - DAY

          Isabelle walks through the snow. A thick fog gives the
          forest a strange, dream-like feeling. A cold wind blows.
          Soon Isabelle becomes aware of FOOTSTEPS behind her. She
          stops and turns. Slowly, a figure appears. It's Peter.

                         PETER
          Thank God you're all right.
          He tries to take her hand, but she pulls away. A beat.

                         ISABELLE
          I'm fine. You sent Henri to help
          me.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         CONTINUED:

                         PETER
          What did he tell you?
          Isabelle gives him a hurt look.

                         ISABELLE
          Those people back there. I know
          they mean well, but they're just
          people. I didn't expect anything
          from them. I expected something
          from you.

                         PETER
          I just need to talk to you.

                         ISABELLE
          I'm going to see my Grandmother.
          She's sick. Please don't follow
          me.
          Isabelle starts walking again. Peter just stands there,
          watching her go. When she looks back, he's gone. She
          sighs, wiping tears from her eyes. She continues on...
          Then: FOOTSTEPS behind her again. She stops and looks
          back. Listens. Nothing. She keeps walking. But then
          she HEARS them again. Looks back. A dark figure follows
          her in the fog. She walks faster.
          She reaches the fork in the path. She pauses. The
          FOOTSTEPS are still behind her. She makes a decision.
          She breaks off a tree branch and backs toward the
          abandoned path, using the branch to sweep away her tracks
          in the snow. When she's far enough away from the main
          path, she throws the branch aside...
          ... and turns to face the abandoned path. It looks
          ominous. She gives it a wary look, then starts walking.

          EXT. GULLY - DAY

          Isabelle reaches the rope bridge. More of the rotten
          boards have fallen out during the winter. Isabelle looks
          down. It's a long drop to the river below. She edges
          out, stepping carefully on the snow-covered boards,
          holding onto the rope with both hands...
          Suddenly -- CRACK! A board SNAPS under her weight. At
          the last instant, she regains her balance. The broken
          board SPLASHES into the water. She takes a moment to
          catch her breath before continuing...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Isabelle crosses the little bridge and knocks on the
          front door. The fog still hangs over everything. She
          doesn't notice the dark stain under her feet...

                         ISABELLE
          Grandmother? Are you awake?
          She listens at the door. A long beat. Then:

          THE FIGURE (O.S.)
          Pull the bobbin. The latch will
          open.
          We recognize the thin, raspy voice. Isabelle hesitates,
          then pulls the bobbin and opens the door...

          INT. MANOR HOUSE - DUNGEON - DUSK

          The Reeve and a GUARD examine something O.S.

                         REEVE
          You're certain nobody has seen him
          since last night?

                         GUARD
          The Wolf must have taken him.
          What else could have done that?
          They're looking at the cell where Cesaire was locked up.
          The metal door has been ripped off its hinges...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK

          Isabelle closes the door. A pot is cooking over the
          fire. The cat lounges in its heat, grooming itself. It
          looks up at Isabelle as she enters. Isabelle stops.
          The veil that has always been closed is now open. Beyond
          it, we see Grandmother propped up in bed. The light is
          too dim to see her very well, just a candle by her bed.
          She's wearing a nightgown and cap. She doesn't move.

                         THE FIGURE
          I've been expecting you.
          Isabelle starts toward the bedroom with the basket...

                         ISABELLE
          Mother sent some food. There are
          cakes and a pot of butter --

                         THE FIGURE
          Don't come in here.
          Isabelle stops short. Grandmother's face is cloaked in
          darkness. Isabelle gives her a questioning look.

                         THE FIGURE
          I'm not hungry right now.

                         ISABELLE
          Are you sure? You sound so weak.

                         THE FIGURE
          I just made myself a stew. I left
          it over the fire for you.
          Isabelle glances back at the pot BUBBLING over the fire.

                         ISABELLE
          I came here to take care of you.
          Not the other way around.

                         THE FIGURE
          Don't be silly, my dear. You've
          been through so much. Sit down.
          Isabelle considers for a beat, then places the basket on
          the table, next to a ball of yarn with Grandmother's
          knitting needles sticking out of it.

                         THE FIGURE
          There's no burden so heavy that it
          doesn't seem a little lighter on a
          full stomach.

                         ISABELLE

                         (SMILES)
          You always say that.
          She ladles some soup into a bowl and sits down. The cat
          looks up from its grooming, watching her...

                         THE FIGURE
          That's right. Eat up, my dear.
          Eat up.
          Isabelle takes a bite of the hot soup. The cat jumps up
          on the table and lies down next to her, licking its paw.

                         ISABELLE
          I've been worried about you. When
          you didn't come back yesterday, I
          was afraid...

                         (BEAT)
          You were wrong about Henri.

                         THE FIGURE
          Was I now?

                         ISABELLE
          Yes. He saved my life.
          Isabelle takes another bite of soup, then pauses. She
          puts the bowl down and loosens her collar...

                         ISABELLE
          I feel hot all of a sudden.

                         THE FIGURE
          It's just the stew warming you.
          Isabelle hesitates, but keeps eating. Then she takes a
          closer look at the cat. There's blood on its paw.
          That's what it has been licking this whole time.
          Suddenly, Isabelle feels faint. She breaks out in a
          sweat. She looks at the soup. A thick broth with chunks
          of white meat...

                         ISABELLE
          What is this...?

                         THE FIGURE
          If you don't like it, there's wine
          on the table to wash it down.
          Isabelle reaches for the bottle with an unsteady hand and
          pours herself a cup. She takes a sip... and freezes.
          It's not wine. It's blood. She gags and drops the cup,
          spilling blood everywhere. The cat jumps away.
          She looks at the bottle, turns it over. More blood pours
          out. Isabelle screams and throws it, knocking over the
          pot and spilling the soup. The Figure laughs.

                         THE FIGURE
          Oh, what pretty red lips. Come
          and give your Granny a kiss, my
          dear.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't think I want to.

                         THE FIGURE
          Then I will come to you.
          And with that -- Grandmother slowly starts to move. She
          groans. She's hurt. She stands up. She's much taller
          now than she was. As Isabelle watches in mute dread, the
          Figure pulls off Grandmother's nightgown and cap, hobbles
          into the firelight, revealing its face...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED: (3)
          It's Cesaire. Isabelle quickly stands, startled.

                         ISABELLE
          What is this? Where's
          Grandmother?

                         CESAIRE
          I'm afraid I ate most of her.

                         (BEAT)
          You ate the rest.
          Isabelle gives the spilled stew on the floor a horrified
          look. For a moment, she looks like she may pass out.

                         CESAIRE
          I didn't want to kill her. But
          she finally realized what I was.

          EXT. CREEK - DAWN (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire bathes in a cold stream...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          The hardest thing to hide has
          always been the smell. The
          werewolf musk is strong,
          especially close to the full moon.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The night of the wolf hunt. Henri crouches in the woods,
          clutching his hammer... then freezes with terror. He
          sees the Wolf slink by in the dark, dragging Adrien along
          by his throat. It happened just as Henri said it did.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Henri smelled it the night he saw
          me. And he recognized the smell
          later.

          EXT. STABLE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

          Grandmother's confrontation with Henri. She stumbles
          outside and practically runs right into Cesaire...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          He thought it was your
          Grandmother. He didn't know he
          was smelling me. But she did.
          She'd lived with the smell her
          whole life, she just had no way of
          knowing what it was.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Grandmother hands Cesaire a stack of knitted blankets.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Once she realized what it was, of
          course, she knew the truth. She
          tried to sneak a message to Father
          Auguste last night.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire carries the blankets back to the cart. He
          quickly looks inside them and finds a note: 'MEUS FILIUS
          EST LUPUS.' Subtitle: 'My son is the wolf.'

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Luckily, she'd taught me how to
          read.

          BACK TO SCENE
          Isabelle shakes her head, tears streaming down her face.

                         ISABELLE
          You're not the Wolf. You can't
          be...

                         CESAIRE
          Look into my eyes. The one part
          of me I can never change.
          Isabelle looks into his eyes... and recoils in horror.

                         ISABELLE
          Oh, dear God... You killed Lucie?
          You killed my sister?

                         CESAIRE
          I did more than that to her.
          Isabelle steps away from him, mind reeling. He snarls.

                         CESAIRE
          I only wish your mother could have
          known what I did to her. The girl
          she passed off as my daughter.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The night of the festival. SCREAMS can be heard coming
          from the village square. Suzette runs outside...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I was made a cuckold by your
          mother. But I paid her back.
          She hears a LOW GROWL. She turns, startled. It's the
          Wolf. It lunges at her, raking her face with its claws.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The wolf hunt. Adrien hears SOMETHING move in the brush.
          He looks toward it... and sees the Wolf staring at him
          from the darkness.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I paid her lover back, too.

          BACK TO SCENE
          To Isabelle's dismay, Cesaire has tears in his eyes.

                         CESAIRE
          Lucie was the joy of my life. But
          she wasn't mine.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, she was. In every way that
          matters, she was.

                         CESAIRE
          No. Not in every way that
          matters. My father sired me. I
          am a werewolf because it was in
          his blood. Because I was his.

                         ISABELLE
          Did Grandmother know?

                         CESAIRE
          No. And neither does your mother.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

          The night Lucie died. Cesaire pours mugs of beer, but
          this time we see him sprinkle something in the beer
          before serving it -- Grandmother's sleeping herb.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I put an herb in the beer to make
          you sleep whenever the moon was
          full. One of your Grandmother's
          old remedies.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)

          Many years ago. Grandmother is in her 40s, asleep in a
          chair, holding an empty cup. Isabelle's GRANDFATHER
          takes the cup from her hand and quietly leaves.
          Grandmother sleeps peacefully by the fire...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          That's how my father got away with
          it. Your grandmother never
          learned the truth. Until last
          night.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Still many years ago. A werewolf runs through the
          woods... followed by a smaller werewolf.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I began to turn when I was
          fourteen. My father and I ran
          together. We hunted freely.
          Killing at will.
          The two werewolves are chasing a FRIGHTENED PEASANT,
          moving in for the kill...

          EXT. DARK FOREST - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The mangled body of the Peasant has been discovered. A
          group of MEN stands around it.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Our only mistake was that we
          gorged ourselves too often on the
          fat flesh of the villagers.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          The two werewolves are running through the woods again,
          this time chased by VILLAGERS with torches and weapons.

                         CESAIRE
          They killed my father.
          Suddenly, the larger werewolf falls into a pit filled
          with sharp stakes. It CRIES OUT in agony. The smaller
          werewolf looks down and WHIMPERS...
          ... watching as the larger werewolf begins to change
          before our eyes. It's reverting to its human form...

                         CONTINUED:
          By the time the Villagers reach the pit, what they find
          is Grandfather's naked body skewered on the stakes. The
          smaller werewolf GROWLS at them and runs away.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          The fools thought my father had
          been thrown in the pit by the
          Wolf. They never suspected that
          he was the Wolf.

          SERIES OF SHOTS (FLASHBACK)
          Cesaire labors in a field. He goes to church. He
          thatches the roof of his cottage in the hot sun...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          I tried to live as my father did,
          but I came to realize that I did
          not belong here. The Wolf was my
          true self. It wasn't something to
          be hidden. It was a gift. I had
          to leave here and never return.

          EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire stands in the cemetery, looking down at his
          father's grave...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          But I did not want to go alone.
          My father and I were part of a
          long and powerful bloodline. It
          was up to me to see that it did
          not die out. I had hoped for a
          son to pass my gift on to.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire mends a fence, but keeps glancing at something...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Instead, God gave me daughters.
          He's looking at Lucie and Isabelle. They help Suzette
          hang clothes to dry. He smiles as he watches them...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          But female werewolves are not
          born. They are made. And I chose
          my eldest.
          Lucie catches him watching. She waves. He waves back.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Another day. Cesaire is giving Lucie a stern lecture.
          Lucie's face is ashen and there are tears in her eyes.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          When I finally decided to leave, I
          told Lucie the truth. And I gave
          her a choice. She could come with
          me. Or I would take you instead.
          Lucie turns and sees Isabelle approaching. We realize
          that we've seen this moment before.

                         CESAIRE
          This doesn't concern you,
          Isabelle.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, Father.
          Isabelle walks away. Cesaire watches her go...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          She agreed to come with me. She
          did it to protect you.

          INT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - LOFT - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Isabelle is fast asleep. Lucie sneaks out of bed...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          We arranged to meet on the night
          of the next full moon.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Lucie stands naked, arms clutched around her breasts.
          Then, a NOISE in the brush. She turns and sees...

                         CESAIRE
          She was not a werewolf yet. I had
          to turn her.
          ... the Wolf emerge from the forest with a scrap of
          bloody meat dangling from its jaws.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - CLEARING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Later. Lucie weeps as she forces herself to eat the raw
          meat scraps. The Wolf watches, panting...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          First, she had to eat human flesh.
          I fed her from a kill I had made
          the month before. But the ritual
          was not yet complete. She had to
          be bitten by a male werewolf.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle looks like she's going to be ill.

                         CESAIRE
          The bite should have changed her.
          It should have made her like me.
          But it didn't. That's when I
          knew. There was no werewolf blood
          in her. I was not her father. I
          was so angry. I killed her before
          I even realized I was doing it.

          INT. TAVERN COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Cesaire sits slumped in a corner, too drunk to move. A
          hand reaches in to help him. It's Isabelle.

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          Afterwards, I thought about
          killing myself. The only thing
          that kept me alive was you.

          EXT. ISABELLE'S FAMILY COTTAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

          Isabelle helps drunk Cesaire into bed...

          CESAIRE (V.O.)
          You were so beautiful. So kind.
          And I knew you were mine. That's
          why you could understand me when
          no one else could. You were mine.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Cesaire takes Isabelle's hand and won't let it go. She
          backs into the wall. He looms over her...

                         CESAIRE
          Do you see now? This is your
          heritage. This is what you are.
          Everything I have done has been to
          insure the future of our
          bloodline. We will run together

                         CONTINUED:

                         CESAIRE (CONT'D)
          like my father and I once did.
          You are the next generation. You
          have had your first taste of human
          flesh. Now one bite from me is
          all that is needed to change you.
          It will only hurt for a moment.
          And then you will be as I am.

                         ISABELLE
          There must indeed be a God. For
          you are surely the Devil...

                         CESAIRE
          I will give you a choice. Come
          with me now. Or refuse me and let
          your friends suffer in your place.
          I will kill them one by one. Your
          mother. Roxanne. Peter.
          Isabelle shudders. She slowly pulls away and he releases
          her. She walks over to the table, her back to him. She
          eyes the ball of yarn with Grandmother's knitting needles
          in it. A long beat. Isabelle chokes back tears.

                         ISABELLE
          Father...?
          He approaches her. Stands behind her and places his hand
          on her shoulder. Her skin crawls.

                         CESAIRE
          Yes, my dear?

                         ISABELLE
          You gave me two choices.
          She turns to face him. Looks up at him.

                         ISABELLE
          But I have thought of a third.
          Suddenly -- CRUNCH! Isabelle drives something hard into
          Cesaire's jaw. He gasps, choking. He puts his had to
          his throat. Blood spills out through his fingers.
          CAMERA FINDS Grandmother's ball of yarn on the table.
          The knitting needles aren't sticking out of it anymore...
          They're sticking out of Cesaire's neck. He falls to his
          knees, gagging. Then he flops over dead. Eyes open.
          Isabelle gazes down at him. She looks like she might
          have just lost her mind. Then she sits on the floor,
          staring at his body... and screams. An eruption of
          rage, betrayal, and heartbreak. She screams.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.

          EXT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          The cottage is dark and quiet.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          It's pitch black in here. There's a KNOCK at the door.

          PETER (O.S.)
          Hello?
          No response. The door CREAKS open. It's Peter. As he
          opens the door, moonlight spills inside to reveal
          Isabelle huddled and trembling in the corner. She's
          screamed and cried herself out. All that's left is anger
          and a grim resolve. She did what she had to do.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Isabelle and Peter sit at the table. A dim candle
          provides the only light. A long beat.

                         ISABELLE
          People should know what he was.

                         PETER
          We can't tell anyone. If they
          don't believe you, they'll hang
          you for this. And if they do
          believe you, they'll hang you for
          being the daughter of the Wolf.

                         ISABELLE
          Then I'll run away. I was ready
          to run away last night.

                         (BEAT)
          Why didn't you come for me?
          Peter gives her a long look. But instead of speaking, he
          rolls up his sleeve. Isabelle's eyes go wide. There's a
          huge scar on his arm. In the shape of a bite mark.

                         PETER
          I was bitten at the festival. I
          spent last night in the woods
          because I was afraid of what might
          happen...

                         (A BEAT)
          I changed. I'm like him now.

                         ISABELLE
          No, you're not. You could never
          be like him.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         CONTINUED:
          Isabelle's tears fall, the full implications of what he's
          saying starting to sink in. He takes her hand.

                         PETER
          I can't stay here.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, you can. We can still be
          together. My father lived here.
          My grandfather lived here.

                         PETER
          Your father and your grandfather
          killed people. They couldn't help
          themselves. If I stay here, I
          won't be able to control myself.
          (off her look)
          I have to be alone.
          Isabelle rests her head on his and they just sit like
          that, leaning against one another in the candlelight...

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Isabelle and Peter crouch next to Cesaire's body. The
          candle is on the floor, casting weird shadows.

                         PETER
          We could take him to the river.

                         ISABELLE
          I don't want him ever found.

                         PETER
          We'll weight him with rocks.

                         ISABELLE
          No. We'll put the rocks inside
          him.
          (off his look)
          Cut him open. I will sew the
          rocks inside him.
          Peter is taken aback. She's serious.

          INT. GRANDMOTHER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT (LATER)

          Peter and Isabelle have placed several heavy rocks next
          to Cesaire's body. Peter opens Cesaire's shirt and takes
          out a hunting knife. Isabelle gives Peter a nod. Peter
          somewhat reluctantly lowers the knife, his shoulder
          moving up and down as he goes about his unseen task...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         CONTINUED:
          Moments later, Isabelle threads a needle and coldly
          stitches begins stitching. We don't see what she's
          doing, but there's blood on her needle and thread.
          There's a spot of blood on her cheek, too.

          EXT. RIVER - FERRY DOCK - NIGHT

          Low mist hugs the ground. There's a wooden A-frame
          pontoon raft tied to a ferry dock. A guy-rope runs
          through the A-frame to a pier on the opposite shore.
          Isabelle and Peter nervously approach. He pushes a
          wheelbarrow onto the raft, its contents wrapped in
          burlap. Peter unties the moorings and is about to shove
          off, but Isabelle stops him:

                         ISABELLE
          Wait.
          She pulls back the burlap, revealing Cesaire's dead body.
          His belly is lumpy and misshapen, an ugly red line in his
          torso stitched together with black thread. The knitting
          needles still jut out of his jaw. Isabelle yanks them
          out, then pulls the burlap back over Cesaire's body.
          Peter gives her a questioning look.

                         ISABELLE
          These belonged to my grandmother.
          The knitting needles are covered in blood. Peter takes
          out a rag and wipes the blood off for her. And as he
          does... something begins to shine through in the
          moonlight. Peter gives Isabelle a stunned look.

                         PETER
          They're silver.

          EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

          Peter uses a long pole to push the raft across the water.
          Isabelle gazes out at the moonlit mist. They stop the in
          the middle of the river. They exchange a look...
          ... then each take a side of the wheelbarrow and dump the
          body into the water. It sinks instantly and is gone.

                         PETER
          Death was too good for him.

                         ISABELLE
          I can live with it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          118.

          EXT. RIVER - OPPOSITE BANK - NIGHT

          Isabelle and Peter stand on the shore. He kisses her and
          she holds his face in her hands, wanting the kiss to last
          forever. When they part, she gives him an aching look.

                         ISABELLE
          Where will you go?

                         PETER
          I don't know. I need to
          understand what I've become.
          Maybe I can learn to control it.
          (off her look)
          I'll take my own life before I
          take another's.

                         ISABELLE
          I know.

                         PETER
          I'm not coming back. I don't want
          you to wait for me. This is the
          last time you'll ever see me.

                         ISABELLE
          No, it isn't. You'll be in my
          dreams until the day I die.
          Peter turns and starts to walk away. But then he pauses.

                         PETER
          You know, Henri is a good man.

                         ISABELLE
          Yes, he is.
          Then Peter continues on until he vanishes in the fog.
          CAMERA PUSHES IN on Isabelle as she watches him go...

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          I never saw him again.

          EXT. VILLAGE - VARIOUS - DAY

          SPRINGTIME. The leaves have returned to the forest with
          explosions of green. Crops grow in the fields. Flowers
          bloom. The village is vibrant with life and beauty.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          Life in my village was changed
          forever. There were many
          questions and few answers. In the

          end, the Wolf did not return. And
          that was answer enough for most.

          EXT. CHURCH - DAY

          Isabelle and Henri stand before Father Auguste. They're
          getting married. Roxanne, Suzette, and other friends and
          neighbors watch as Isabelle and Henri exchange rings.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          Henri and I were married. He was
          a good man and a good father. I
          loved him very much. But I never
          loved him the same way that I
          loved Peter. That was the one
          secret in our marriage.

          EXT. FIELD - DAY

          Isabelle laughs as she watches Henri run around, playing
          with their three young children -- TWIN GIRLS and a BOY.
          Isabelle gives Henri a warm, loving smile.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          I only tell you now because he is
          dead. And if he knows now, I
          believe that he forgives me, for
          he must also know that I never
          loved him falsely.

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle's Girls are in bed asleep. Isabelle enters,
          carrying the sleeping Boy. She gently places him in bed
          next to the girls and covers them with a blanket.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          This is my story, not that I
          expect you will believe it. In my
          own village, the events of that
          awful winter have already passed
          into legend. Parents tell their
          children to be good or else the
          Wolf will come and gobble them up.
          Isabelle smiles as she watches them sleep.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          They've already forgotten. A
          simple children's story is all
          that remains.

          EXT. BLACKSMITH'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

          Isabelle opens the door and strolls outside, looking up
          at the sky. The moon is full.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          But sometimes, when the moon is
          full, my thoughts still turn to
          Peter. He promised me that I
          would never see him again. And I
          never have.
          Somewhere, a wolf HOWLS. Isabelle smiles.

          OLD WOMAN (V.O.)
          But I often wonder if I hear him.

          EXT. DARK FOREST - NIGHT

          High on a hilltop, CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a WOLF
          staring down at the distant village. It's hard to tell
          in the moonlight whether it's a normal wolf...
          Or something else.
          It looks up at the bright full moon and HOWLS as we

          FADE OUT.

     TITLE CARD... BELEM BRAZIL - JULY... 

     EXT. BELEM STREETS - NIGHT

     A taxi careens down narrow roadways at breakneck speeds.

     INT. TAXI - NIGHT

     In the back seat is WHITTLESLEY. Early 40's, the wreck of a once
     handsome man. Unshaven.  Sweat stained.  Rail thin.  Scratches on his
     arms, a fresh scar on one cheek.  As the taxi roars downhill towards
     the harbor, Whittlesley leans over the front seat.  (Italics indicate
     Portuguese to be subtitled)

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Faster!  We won't make it.

                              DRIVER
                    You want to die?

     Whittlesley pulls out A KNIFE, puts it to the driver's jugular vein.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Do you?

     Sweat pouring down his brow, the driver re-doubles his speed.

     EXT. BELEM STREETS - NIGHT

     The taxi swerves around a corner, nearly crashing into a fruit cart,
     flies out of sight.

     EXT. HARBOR - BELEM - NIGHT

     Light rain obscures the bulky outlines of tethered freighters.  We hear
     faint laughter leavened with Portuguese phrases, distant Calypso music
     from waterfront bars.  One of the smaller boats, the SANTA LUCIA, is
     loading as the TAXI fishtails to a halt.

     Whittlesley gets out, sees the boat still at dock.  His face floods
     with relief.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Thank God.

     He tosses a handful of bills into the driver's lap, sprints up the
     pier as the driver shouts curses after him in Portuguese.  Whittlesley
     shoves past the dock hands as the last load goes onto the Santa Lucia.
     The boat's engines churn to life.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    I need to speak to the captain!
                    Where is he?

     The sailors hold Whittlesley back.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Get your hands off me!  I'm trying
                    to save your lives, you fools!

     Several crew members murmur the word "loco".  Hearing the commotion, a
     squat man wearing a billed hat and smoking a cigar approaches.  CAPTAIN
     FRANCO.

                              FRANCO
                    American?

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Yes.  Thank Christ somebody speaks
                    English.  I'm Dr. John Whittlesley.
                    You have some crates of mine on
                    board.  They were shipped by mistake
                    to the Natural History Museum.  We
                    have to get them off the boat.

                              FRANCO
                    You have I.D.?

     Whittlesley runs a trembling hand through his hair, trying to keep
     control and appear reasonable.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    No.  Let me explain.  I was on an
                    expedition for the museum on the
                    Upper Xingu.  Something horrible
                    happened.  I'm the only one who got
                    out alive.  I lost everything, my
                    I.D., everything.  I have to make
                    sure no one else dies.  The crates,
                    the crates were sent out before we
                    knew.  There's something unspeakable
                    inside.  If your boat leaves harbor
                    with those crates on board, I can't
                    be responsible.  My God, if they
                    reach New York... 

     Whittlesley's fists clench spasmodically.  Franco looks to his men.

                              FRANCO
                    Loco.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    No!  I'm not crazy!  As God is my
                    witness, I'm telling the truth.

     Franco barks an order and several sailors grab Whittlesley by the
     arms.  They start to lead him back to shore.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Don't do this!  You have to believe
                    me.  Your lives are in danger.

     The sailors laugh.  But with an almost super-human strength born of
     desperation, Whittlesley throws them off.  He pulls out his wallet.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Cash.  Cash, you see?  American money.

     Whittlesley throws the money down on the deck.  The breeze scatters the
     bills across the bow and all the men, including Captain Franco,
     scramble for the money, chattering in Portuguese.  While they are
     occupied, Whittlesley slips by unnoticed and disappears below deck.

     INT. HOLD - SANTA LUCIA - NIGHT

     Whittlesley ducks between cages of goats, boxes of farm equipment, his
     movements jerky with panic.  As he continues searching, the camera
     moves past him, into the darkness of the hold.  We hear Whittlesley
     mumbling between low, ragged breaths.  At the back of the boat the
     camera finds... 

     A STACK OF CRATES... clearly labeled NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM.  Move in on
     these as... The CRATES VIBRATE.  The boat has started to move!
     Whittlesley stands bolt upright, realizing what's going on.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    No!

     Too late.  He turns to run back on deck but then stops, sniffs the air.
     A look of desperation fills his eyes.  With one hand he pulls out THE
     KNIFE, and unexpectedly puts it to HIS OWN NECK.  Better to kill
     himself than face what comes next.  The knife touches... 

     A NECKLACE of TWO ARROWS, one gold, another silver.

     Whittlesley stares wide-eyed into the blackness of the hold.  The goats
     start BLEATING in blind panic.  A shaft of moonlight comes through a
     porthole as the boat turns.  The moonlight falls on

     THE CRATES.  Whittlesley's eyes lock onto them and he inches towards
     them, drawn inexorably closer... closer... 

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    No... no... 

     He begins mumbling a prayer.

     MOVE IN ON HIS EYES... filled with dread as he falls to his knees,
     staring, always staring at THE CRATES... 

     EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

     The crew tends to business and the Santa Lucia points out of the
     harbor, disappears into the night.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. LOUISIANNA COAST - DAY... TITLE CARD... JUNE

     Squad cars roar down the back roads, sirens flashing.  In the center of
     the column is an unmarked car.

     INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

     At the wheel is a strikingly dignified and imposing black man wearing
     a simple, old-fashioned dark suit, narrow black tie, and white shirt.
     This is SPECIAL AGENT PENDERGAST, FBI.

     A BACH SONATA for violin and harpsichord plays on the tape deck.
     Pendergast hums along as he drives.  A SMALL TOWN COP rides shotgun.
     The cop is intimidated both by Pendergast and the morning's events.  He
     sweats heavily as he brings Pendergast up to date.

                              SMALL TOWN COP
                    One of the locals found it at dawn.
                    Didn't believe him 'till I saw it
                    myself.  Even then I didn't believe
                    it.  Scared my men shitless.  Me too.
                    I mean... hell... You could smell it a
                    half mile away, Mr. Pendergast.

                              PENDERGAST
                        (unperturbed)
                    Any of your men go on board?

                              SMALL TOWN COP
                    No sir.  No way.  None of us wanted
                    to, I'm the first to admit it.  I
                    said, "Don't get within a mile of
                    this thing.  It's way to big for us.
                    I'm calling the FBI."

     Pendergast nods his approval, resumes humming along with a
     particularly intricate harpsichord riff.  As always, the man is
     unflappable and totally calm as he drives.

     EXT. LOUISIANA BEACH - DAY

     The ocean is still, the air stifling and close.  A hot sun beats down
     on the deck of the SANTA LUCIA.  The boat lists at a crazy angle where
     it has been washed up on the shore.  At first glance, it appears to be
     deserted.  A barrel rolls back and forth as the boat is rocked by each
     successive wave.  We hear sirens approaching and the phalanx of squad
     cars pulls up.  Joining them now are TWO AMBULANCES.

     PENDERGAST gets out along with the others.  All of the cops immediately
     cover their faces, gagging violently at the smell.  Pendergast sniffs
     once and frowns.  Apart from this, he doesn't react.

                              SMALL TOWN COP
                        (choking)
                    Goin' up-wind if you don't mind.

     Pendergast nods.  The cops all fall back in revulsion.  They watch from
     a safe distance as Pendergast approaches the ghost ship.  His shiny
     laced wing-tips sink in the sand.  He leans down, pulls them off one at
     a time.  He balls both socks, puts them carefully into his shoes and
     proceeds barefoot towards the boat.

     Using a piece of driftwood as a plank, Pendergast leans it against the
     Santa Lucia.  With surprising agility, he leaps up the plank to the
     deck.  At the top he touches a rail.  It's covered in a DARK STICKY
     LIQUID.

     BLOOD.  Flies buzz loudly.  A LARGE MACHETE lies abandoned in the stern.
     Chairs are overturned.  A DEAD GOAT, eviscerated, lies in the bow.  A
     lifeboat hangs half off the stern.  Pendergast moves aft.  The COPS
     watch from the sand below, unwilling to get any closer.  Pendergast
     hears A DOOR slamming open and closed.  He follows the noise and
     sees... 

     THE DOOR TO THE HOLD.  He approaches, pushes it open and looks down the
     stairwell.  Below deck are

     BODIES... stacks of them.  They've been TORN TO SHREDS.

     THE CAMERA MOVES down to one particular man who is nearest the top of
     the stairs.  It's CAPTAIN FRANCO.  His face is frozen in a howl of
     terror.  Flies congregate in the eye sockets.  With his foot, Pendergast
     nudges the body over.  The skull has been torn open.

     THERE IS NO BACK TO FRANCO'S HEAD.

     FADE TO BLACK:

     Silence then we begin hearing sounds of the city... horns, traffic,
     construction work.

     SUPER TITLE... NEW YORK CITY, FOUR MONTHS LATER as we... 

     FADE IN:

     ON A NECKLACE of TWO ARROWS, one of gold, the other silver.  The twin
     to the one seen on Whittlesley.  Widen to... 

     EXT. ROOFTOP GARDEN - MARGO'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING

     And the woman wearing the necklace... MARGO GREEN.  She sips her morning
     coffee as she makes notes on several large FOSSILIZED TEETH.  Her hair
     is neatly combed.  No make-up.  She doesn't need it.  She has a natural,
     unselfconscious beauty and a mind like a steel trap.

     At Margo's elbow is a small T.V.  A CNN world news report plays.
     Margo's New York Times is open to the crossword puzzle, which she's
     been doing rapidly, in ink.  Clearly this is a woman who likes order,
     with a mind that can handle more than one thing at a time.

     An alarm on her watch beeps and she fills in the last two lines of the
     crossword puzzle, makes one final note on the fossil specimens, and
     shuts off the T.V.  She reaches for her back pack and looks out at
     CENTRAL PARK with remarkably clear eyes.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

     HELICOPTER SHOT... Swooping over the fall foliage of the Park, a riot
     of color and botanical life... The camera picks out MARGO'S BICYCLE
     making its way along the winding roads, dodging taxi cabs.  Margo wears
     jeans, a work shirt, a fine blue gabardine jacket with a rhinestone
     DOUBLE HELIX PIN.  On her back is a LEATHER BACK PACK which holds her
     lap top computer.  She emerges from the park, catches the green light
     and rolls up to... 

     EXT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY

     As Margo arrives, the camera moves up and over the building, comes to
     rest on the imposing turrets, intersecting roof lines, and Gothic
     arches of the MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.  This is not an ordinary
     building; it's a 19th century monument to science and mankind.  The
     structure fills an entire city block.

     Happy visitors pour into the museum as Margo takes the imposing wide
     stone steps two at a time.  We hear SCREAMS of pleasure and release,
     the normal raucous noises of a large group of THIRD GRADE CHILDREN.
     Margo is amused to find herself surrounded by kids.  Their teacher,
     MRS. BEASLEY, a stern woman in glasses with a thick New York accent,
     calls after them as they all head inside.

                              MRS. BEASLEY
                    Don't run, children!  Stay with your
                    partner and do not run!  If anyone
                    runs they will be sent back to the
                    bus!

     Ignoring Mrs. Beasley, TWO BOYS charge past Margo.  HENRY and LARRY.
     Henry has a buzz cut; Larry has rasta dread knots.  Both are 8 years
     old, wear high top sneakers and shorts so big they graze their ankles.

                              MRS. BEASLEY
                    Henry!  Larry!  What did I just say!
                    You walk right this minute!  Did you
                    hear me?!

     Reluctantly, Henry and Larry slow to a rapid race-walk as they reach
     the huge doorway flanked by two Northwest Coast Indian totem poles.
     Above the doorway WORKMEN are hanging a LARGE BANNER.  It reads:
     "SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT... OPENING OCT. 29"

     INT. MUSEUM ROTUNDA/STAIRWELL - DAY

     The school children burst into a three story space dominated by a
     life-sized statue of a HERD OF ELEPHANTS.  The kids chatter with
     excitement, look up in awe.  Margo nods to a GUARD who smiles as she
     pins on a plastic I.D.

                              GUARD
                    Morning, Dr. Green.

                              MARGO
                    Morning Joe.  Beautiful day.

     Henry watches Margo pass through the turnstiles without paying.  He
     swaggers over.

                              HENRY
                    You work here?

                              MARGO
                    Yes, I do.

                              HENRY
                    What do you do?

                              MARGO
                        (leans down, amused)
                    I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What
                    do you do?

                              HENRY
                    Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's
                    a revolutionary what ch'a ma'
                    callit?

                              MARGO
                    Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how
                    life on earth evolved over millions
                    of years.

                              HENRY
                        (brightens)
                    Way cool.  Then you know where the
                    dinosaurs are.

                              MARGO
                    Fourth floor, West wing, but stay
                    with your class.

     Mrs. Beasley heads into the museum and Larry and Henry merge with the
     rest of the kids.  Margo turns towards the stairwell, passing... 

     IAN CUTHBERT... Museum Director... a pudgy man in wire rim glasses who
     dresses and thinks like a banker.  Hired for his amazing ability to
     raise money, Cuthbert is one of a new generation of Museum Directors
     whose focus must always be on the bottom line.

                              MARGO
                    Hello, Ian.  Everything ready for the
                    opening of the Superstition Exhibit?

                              CUTHBERT
                    I'm on my way to get the last piece
                    out of storage right now.

                              MARGO
                    I'd wish you luck but I'm not
                    superstitious.

                              CUTHBERT
                    You will be after tomorrow night.

     Cuthbert waves merrily.  A workman uses a LADDER in the stairwell.
     Cuthbert is about to walk under the ladder, stops and carefully walks
     around it instead.  Margo smiles, goes on upstairs.

     INT. MUSEUM BASEMENT - DAY

     Cuthbert enters from the lower stairwell.  He is now in one of the
     hundreds of areas of the museum that are closed to the the general
     public.  He follows a labyrinthine route down a dim passageway lined
     with rumbling steam pipes.  There are storage areas on both sides
     labeled ORNITHOLOGY, HERPITOLOGY, CENTRAL ASIA EXPEDITIONS, AKELEY
     EXPEDITIONS, WHALE BONE FOSSILS and so on.  Finally Cuthbert comes to a
     door marked

     "WHITTLESLEY EXPEDITIONS 1978-95".  Cuthbert pauses and gets out a key,
     but to his surprise the door pushes open.  The lock and doorknob
     mechanism are both broken off!  Cuthbert frowns.

                              CUTHBERT
                    What the... ?

     He goes inside.

     INT. WHITTLESLEY COLLECTION BASEMENT - DAY

     Cuthbert flips on a light to see a tall, narrow space.  Stacks of metal
     shelves reach up into the gloom.  Everywhere we see spears, shields,
     masks, various artifacts.  Ancient tribal costumes lie shrouded in
     plastic like corpses against the walls.  And in the middle of the
     gloom, sitting ominously in the light of a sole hanging bulb are... 

     THE WHITTLESLEY CRATES.  The same ones last seen in the hold of the
     ill-fated Santa Lucia.  They are scattered about in disarray.  One in
     particular has been broken open, its contents spread on the floor.
     Cuthbert mutters in surprise and dismay, kneels by the crate.

                              CUTHBERT
                    No, it can't be.

     Cuthbert feels gently through the packing material, lets out a sigh of
     relief as he pulls out a figurine.  It is a small, beautifully carved
     statue of A MONSTER crouched on all fours.

     The room falls totally silent as Cuthbert studies THE RELIC.  It's a
     truly frightening piece... massive, razor sharp claws, large round
     nostrils, enormous teeth and red rimmed eyes.  Suddenly Cuthbert sees a
     DROP OF BLOOD on his hand!  He's been CUT!

                              CUTHBERT
                    Damn.

     Cuthbert rises, shakes his finger in pain.  Blood drips on the floor.
     He pulls out his pocket handkerchief and wraps the wound.  The
     handkerchief rapidly soaks through.  Suddenly a HAND CLAMPS on
     Cuthbert's shoulder!  He's not alone!  He lets out a YELP, almost
     dropping the Relic and spins to see... 

     A MUSEUM GUARD standing behind him.  His nameplate reads... BEAUREGARD.
     He's a gentle young fellow with white blond hair and a rolling
     southern accent.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Beauregard!  You scared me half to
                    death.

                              BEAUREGARD
                    I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?

                              CUTHBERT
                    Someone broke into this room.

                              BEAUREGARD
                    Anything missin'?

                              CUTHBERT
                    Doesn't look like it.  We're damned
                    lucky.  This statue is priceless.

     Cuthbert holds up the RELIC of THE MONSTER.  Beauregard stares.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Mbwun.  A South American warrior
                    deity.  He carries a powerful curse.
                    Every member of the expedition that
                    found this statue, died.

     Beauregard sees Cuthbert's cut finger.

                              BEAUREGARD
                    Looks like the curse is still at
                    work.

                              CUTHBERT
                    The claws are sharp... I must have
                    cut myself.
                        (uneasy laugh)
                    Better move these crates to the
                    secure storage area where they'll be
                    safe.

     Beauregard studies the door as Cuthbert heads out with the figurine.

                              BEAUREGARD
                    Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr.
                    Cuthbert.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Why not?

                              BEAUREGARD
                    No one broke into this room, sir.
                    Someone broke out.  That lock was
                    torn off from the inside.

     Cuthbert glances at the evil face of Mbwun, pales.  As he exits, HOLD
     ON BEAUREGARD, left alone with the crates.

     INT. PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB - DAY

     Huge centrifuges, hissing autoclaves, electrophoresis apparati,
     glowing monitors, elaborate blown-glass distillation columns and
     titration set-ups.  One of the most advanced technical facilities of
     its kind.  And mixed in with all the modern machinery are

     SKELETONS OF ALL KINDS.  Complete homo sapien specimens are scattered
     around the room.  Standing midst all this is GREGORY KAWAKITA, early
     twenties.  Kawakita makes sharp, jerky overhead movements with his left
     hand, waving something about.  He's practicing casting.  We hear the
     zing of a line and the whirring of the fly reel as MARGO ENTERS.  A fly
     whips out, passing right under her nose.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Third from the end!  Right shoulder.
                    Aleut, provenance unknown.

     The fly zooms across the room and lights on the shoulder of the third
     skeleton from the end, labeled "Aleut, provenance unknown." Margo
     rolls her eyes and Kawakita smiles with pride.

                              KAWAKITA
                    If I spent half the time on my
                    Fractal Evolution thesis that I
                    spend on this fly rod, I'd have my
                    PhD.

                              MARGO
                        (small smile)
                    But at what a price.

     Kawakita reels in his line as Margo drops her backpack on her large
     desk.  An enormous MICROSCOPE stands by the equally imposing computer
     topped by a tiger skull.  A screen saver of an animated pterodactyl
     plays.  Margo unpacks boxes of fossil teeth, hits some keys revealing
     columns of seemingly indecipherable chemical equations on the computer
     screen.

                              MARGO
                    I have the species identification on
                    these teeth.  We can extract DNA and
                    start running tests on the
                    extrapolator program.  Call Dr.
                    Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Margo, you haven't heard?

                              MARGO
                    What?

                              KAWAKITA
                    Frock's been fired.

     Margo straightens, stunned.

                              MARGO
                    That's impossible.

                              KAWAKITA
                        (awkward)
                    I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad
                    tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph.
                    Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the
                    definitive word from Cuthbert's
                    secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last
                    week.

     Margo is already out the door.

     INT. CORRIDORS/STAIRWELL - MUSEUM - DAY

     Margo charges through double doors leading into the southwest tower.
     She half runs down an elegant, Edwardian fifth-floor corridor, her
     footsteps lost in the thick carpet.  At the very end is a heavy oak
     door bearing a plate entwined with bronze leaves that reads simply
     "Dr. Frock".

     INT. FROCK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Margo bursts into the unique office, which is in startling contrast to
     the modernity of her own.  Two large bow windows look out over the
     park.  Upholstered Victorian chairs in a leaf motif sit on needlepoint
     carpets featuring large red roses.  Plant specimens and drawings of
     flora and fauna line the walls.  Cardboard boxes cover the floor.
     Seated in a wheelchair is a white-haired man in a tweed jacket and a
     loud floral tie.  Glasses slip down his nose.

     This is DR. FROCK, and he's in the middle of packing.  He looks up,
     smiles apologetically.

                              DR. FROCK
                    Hello, Margo.  Sorry about the mess.

                              MARGO
                    Is it true?  Greg said you'd been
                    fired.

                              FROCK
                    Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert
                    so tactfully put it, the museum
                    needs new blood.  And since I've been
                    here since the Mesozoic Era --

                              MARGO
                    I don't believe it.

                              FROCK
                    Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert
                    has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving
                    makes perfect sense.  This isn't
                    exactly early retirement.  I've
                    overstayed the party a bit.

                              MARGO
                    We can't do without you.  You're one
                    of the foremost authorities on
                    primitive pharmacology.  You're
                    practically an institution around
                    here.

                              FROCK
                    That, apparently, is the problem.
                    I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a
                    Curator of Plant Biology in a museum
                    with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters
                    and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans
                    are the new currency of the realm.

     Frock goes back to his work packing to hide his emotion and Margo
     moves to his side.  She pulls Frock's books back out of the box,
     returns them to his desk.

                              MARGO
                    "Phyletic Transformation and the
                    Tertiary Fern Spike" is not going
                    anywhere.  I'll talk to Cuthbert and
                    put a stop to this right now.

     She starts for the door and Frock wheels into her path.  Now for the
     first time she sees what he's been carefully hiding... the deep pain in
     his eyes.

                              FROCK
                    Please.  Don't humiliate me further.

                              MARGO
                    Let me help.  I can take care of
                    everything.

                              FROCK
                    No, Margo.  This is one problem you
                    can't solve.  You have to stay out of
                    it.  The fact is, I want to retire.

                              MARGO
                    How can you say that?  You know it's
                    not true.

                              FROCK
                    Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no
                    longer needed --

                              MARGO
                    My work on fossil intermediates
                    would be crippled without you.

                              FROCK
                    With all due respect, dear, that's
                    bull.  You dance rings around me with
                    your new technology.  You've left me
                    in the dust.

                              MARGO
                        (stubbornly loyal)
                    Your work is highly relevant.  What
                    about your display on Primitive
                    Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me
                    himself he was going to feature it
                    prominently in the Superstition
                    Exhibit.

                              FROCK
                    Healing plant use among the Ki tribe
                    of Bechuanaland has been cancelled
                    to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.

     Frock reaches out and squeezes her hand gently with a look that says
     the discussion is over.

                              FROCK
                    Come on.  I'll walk you back to the
                    elevator.

                              MARGO
                    I'm not giving up.

                              FROCK
                    You must.

     INT. MUSEUM HALLWAYS - DAY

     Frock rolls back down the hall the way Margo just came.  Margo is
     beside him, downcast.  She's not used to defeat.

                              FROCK
                    This isn't a death sentence.  Greg
                    has promised to teach me fly
                    fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.

                              MARGO
                    You are this museum.  It won't be the
                    same without you.

                              FROCK
                    Everyone needs a change of scenery.
                    I've been rolling down these halls
                    for forty-odd years.  That's quite
                    enough.

     Margo gets in the elevator reluctantly.  He smiles and meets her eye.

                              FROCK
                    I'll see you at lunch.

     He waves her off merrily.  But once the doors close and Margo's out of
     sight, Frock's smile fades and his shoulders sag.  He ducks his
     wheelchair quickly into the Hall of African Mammals.

     INT. HALL OF AFRICAN MAMMALS - AFTERNOON

     Two stories high, dark and dramatic.  A very special display.  Dioramas
     of lions, hippos, wart hogs etc.  In the middle is a large statue of a
     GORILLA beating its chest.  Frock takes refuge in the darkness of the
     exhibit.  His wheelchair sits in a quiet corner and we see him quickly
     wipe the back of his hands across his eyes.

     INT. MOLLUSKS EXHIBIT - DAY

     Shells and sea life line the walls.  A sign announces the exhibit
     "Mollusks and Our World."  The THIRD GRADE CLASS sweeps in.  Larry and
     Henry start to sing "Mollusks and Our World" to the tune of "Welcome
     to Our World", the F.A.O. Schwartz theme song.  Mrs. Beasley shoots
     them the evil eye and Henry whines... 

                              HENRY
                    Mrs. Beasley, it's almost time to go
                    and we still haven't seen the
                    dinosaurs!

                              BEASLEY
                    If you ask me about the dinosaurs
                    once more, I'II strangle you both!

     She starts to lecture about horseshoe crabs in a droning monotone.
     Henry and Larry hang back.

                              LARRY
                        (whispers)
                    This room sucks.

                              HENRY
                    She's never going to take us to see
                    the dinosaurs.  That lady said they
                    were on the fourth floor.

                              LARRY
                    Let's ditch and find them ourselves.

     They dart off down a side corridor and up a wide stairs.

     INT. REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS ROOM - DAY

     Larry and Henry emerge and walk wide-eyed among the cases of lizards,
     chameleons, tortoises.  High windows light the room.  Outside the sun is
     going down.  A woman pushing a child in a stroller exits and the boys
     have the hall to themselves.

                              LARRY
                    Look at this.  A Komodo dragon.

     As Larry checks out, the huge, dragon-like reptile, which has just
     sunk its Jaws into a stuffed boar.  Henry points to a stuffed Gecko
     climbing vertically up the side of its case.

                              HENRY
                    Check out this one.  It can walk up
                    walls.

     Larry already has his eyes on the far end of the hall where temporary
     barricades have been put up to prevent access to the next room.
     Painting is in progress.  Scaffolding just begs to be climbed.  Henry
     runs over and starts up the scaffolding.  Larry hesitates.

                              LARRY
                    We're not supposed to go back there.

                              HENRY
                    Chicken.  This is a great short cut.

     Henry drops on the other side of the scaffolding and Larry follows.  In
     a moment both disappear from sight.

     INT. MUSEUM HALL OF BIRDS - DAY

     Windowless and dark.  A closed display under maintenance.  Thousands of
     little stuffed birds line the walls from floor to ceiling, white
     cotton poking out of sightless eyes.  Henry and Larry enter and slow
     down.  Larry's getting scared.

                              LARRY
                    I don't want to go this way.

                              HENRY
                    Don't be a wuss.  Come on.

     The boys continue onward more slowly, their footfalls echoing in the
     silence.

     INT. BACK HALLWAYS - DAY

     The children are now far from the other tourists and their class.
     Larry is frightened.  The hall takes a sharp dog-leg, ending in a
     darkened cul-de-sac full of display cases filled with hideous carved
     masks.  Against the side of the chamber is a barricade of wood which
     looks much like a wall.  Henry tugs at it and the barricade moves.  He
     looks behind.

                              HENRY
                    Hey, there's a secret staircase back
                    here.  Cool.

     Henry disappears behind the barricade leaving Larry completely alone
     in the dark room with the Shaman masks.

                              LARRY
                    Henry, come back!

     Henry doesn't respond.  The lights in the cases throw strange shadows.
     Larry starts to sniffle, falls to hiccuping, sits down.  He pulls on a
     little flap of rubber that's coming off the toe of his sneaker, all
     bravado gone.

                              LARRY
                    Henry!  Henry!

     No answer.  Larry rises and peeks behind the barricade.  He sees the
     circular stair.  It descends into total darkness.  From below comes a
     strange smell that makes Larry's nose wrinkle.

                              LARRY
                    Henry?

     No answer.  Larry puts his first foot on the stair.

                              LARRY
                    Henry!  Come up!  Please!

     With no other option but staying alone in the dark, Larry follows
     Henry down.

     INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - DAY

     Larry clutches the banister, whispers... 

                              LARRY
                    Henry?  Where are you?  Henry?

     Larry takes another step.  Another.  And another.  He stops.  Below him he
     hears SNUFFLING, rather like a large dog.  Larry freezes, starts to
     cry.

                              LARRY
                    Henry!  Henry!  It smells awful.
                    Answer me!  Are you all right?

     Larry can barely see a dim hallway stretching out in two directions.
     He pauses near the bottom of the stairs, eyes wide, holding his
     breath.  There appears to be a darker area of SHADOW at the end of the
     hall.  It's gliding TOWARDS THEM!

     Suddenly something CLOSES on Larry's leg and he YELPS.  It's HENRY.
     Henry pulls Larry the rest of the way down the stairs.  They stand
     alone together in the darkness.  Henry hisses.

                              HENRY
                    Quiet!

                              LARRY
                    What is it?

                              HENRY
                    I don't know.  But I think it's bad.

     They keep their eyes locked on the shape at the end of the hall as
     they back up, step by step.  Move in as their faces suddenly TWIST WITH
     FEAR.  THE BOYS... SCREAM BLOODY MURDER... The sound echoes in the
     darkness as we... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. MARGO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Margo sits up in the darkness, gasping.  Moonlight cuts across the bed.
     It takes a moment for her to realize that she's had a nightmare.  She
     reaches for her light.  As she switches it on, we see a photo on her
     bedside table.  It shows a group on a mountain in TIBET.  There are
     several people with their arms slung around each other.  At the end is
     a younger MARGO holding hands with JOHN WHITTLESLEY.  They appear to be
     more than friends.

     ON MARGO... she looks at the photo a moment, then turns off the light
     and lies back, alone in her bed.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY

     Yellow crime tape encircles the museum.  Dead leaves swirl in clusters
     and the sky is overcast.  Overnight, fall turned to winter.  The front
     of the museum is ringed with police cars.  Margo rides up on her bike
     and pauses, startled at the sight.  We watch as she crosses, has a few
     words with one of the officers who motions her to a side entrance.  She
     wheels her bike under a stone tunnel as we pick up... 

     A TAXI CAB arriving at the front entrance.  Out steps SPECIAL AGENT
     PENDERGAST.

     INT. LOWER ROTUNDA - DAY

     Margo enters.  The huge hall is taken up by an enormous boat carved
     from the trunk of a single tree.  Inside it are mannequins of Northwest
     Coast Indians.  Milling around are at least twenty COPS.  One
     approaches.

                              COP
                    ID.

     Worried, Margo hands it over.

                              MARGO
                    What's going on?

                              COP
                    All employees are to go to the IMAX
                    room for a briefing, Dr. Green.

     INT. SIDE HALL - MUSEUM - DAY

     Several cops go by with tracking dogs.  Margo looks back at the dogs,
     increasingly uneasy, almost bumps into... 

     HENRY AND LARRY.  Surprisingly, they are alive and well and seated with
     MRS. BEASLEY outside an office.  Margo exchanges a look with both boys,
     remembering them from yesterday.  A tentative smile starts but Henry
     and Larry don't return it.  Serious and chastened, they drop their
     eyes.  Margo continues on.

     TWO COPS stand outside the door to the rest room, their backs turned
     to Margo as she approaches.

                              COP ONE
                    What was that?  Six?

                              COP TWO
                    Lost count.

     Margo glances past them to see an OLDER MAN wearing the badge of a
     NIGHT WATCHMAN, leaning over a sink.  He wipes his mouth.  Margo's eyes
     move down to see... THE MAN'S SNEAKERS are soaked in blood.

     INT. HALL OF ADVANCED FOSSIL MAMMALS - DAY

     More cops gather, surrounded by skeletons of primates... humans,
     monkeys, gorillas.  It's an odd sight.  They all look up with interest
     as in walks the imposing figure of... 

     SPECIAL AGENT PENDERGAST.  He turns to a young eager beaver, OFFICER
     BAILEY, flashes his badge.  Bailey straightens to attention.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Could you please take me to the
                    officer in charge?

     INT. CIRCULAR STAIRWELL - DAY

     Pendergast follows Bailey as they descend the rickety old metal
     staircase that goes into the bowels of the museum.  The hall below them
     is narrowand lit by an occasional bare bulb.  The stairway opens onto a
     maze-like set of rooms in the basement.  Everything around them is
     STREAKED and SPATTERED in BLOOD.  There are trails of it on the floor,
     the walls, the overhead light.

     Several COPS stand guard as DETECTIVE VINCE D'AGOSTA goes over the
     area.  He is a round, balding, man with an unmistakable air of
     authority.  A modern knight in shining armor in disguise... deep
     disguise.  He has on a cheap polyester short sleeved shirt.  His t-shirt
     is plainly visible underneath.  On his worn plastic belt is a badge.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Don't touch anything until the
                    S.O.C.  has finished with those
                    stairs.  Keep everyone clear of the
                    perimeter.  I don't want any
                    contamination.  There's an incredible
                    amount of blood evidence down here.
                    We need more light.  Where's the
                    photographer?  Tell him to quit
                    eating donuts, I need him.

     As Pendergast enters, D'Agosta looks up at this serious African-
     American in simple black suit, white shirt and dark tie.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Who are you?  The undertaker?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Not at all.  I think we may be
                    working on the same case.  If so, I
                    could use your help.

     The two men shake hands.  They couldn't be more different.  Pendergast
     is an elegant intellectual... D'Agosta a working class spark plug who
     operates from the gut.  Pendergast gestures to the form on the ground.

                              PENDERGAST
                    The body?

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What's left of it.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Mind if I have a look?

     D'Agosta calls to A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER who comes down the staircase
     carrying lights, a donut stuffed in his mouth.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    We need light in here, stat.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Where's the head?

     D'Agosta points to a lump the size of a bowling ball that's in the
     corner.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Careful.  That mess on the ground is
                    brains.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Whose footprints?

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Night watchman who found the body.
                    Sweet old man.  Been tossing his
                    cookies for over an hour.  Not a
                    likely suspect.

     The photographer is finally ready and he floods the dark room with
     light.  And now everyone (but not us) gets a very clear look at the
     body.

     THE PHOTOGRAPHER... spits out his donut.  His eyes roll up and he drops
     in a dead faint.  Just like that.  D'Agosta swallows hard.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Woof.

     Pendergast looks down, utterly impassive.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Yes, I'd say we're definitely
                    working on the same case.

     INT. IMAX ROOM - DAY

     An old 19th century theater.  Balconies.  Heavy curtains.  It looks like
     the theater where Lincoln was shot, with the exception of the most
     recent addition, an IMAX SCREEN five stories high.  The room is filling
     with museum employees, all murmuring anxiously.  Margo sits down next
     to Frock's wheelchair.  Her face is ashen.

                              MARGO
                    Dr. Frock, I just saw a man back
                    there who'd been wading in blood.

     As Greg Kawakita sits in the chair next to Margo... 

                              MARGO (CON'T)
                    For once I'm glad you're rumor
                    central.  What in the world is going
                    on?

                              KAWAKITA
                    Someone's been murdered.  Not shot,
                    strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn
                    limb from limb.  There's talk of a
                    psychotic killer or even an animal.

                              FROCK
                    For heaven's sake, Greg, someone's
                    been killed.  Look, it's Cuthbert.
                    Let's hear what really happened.

     At this everyone falls silent and IAN CUTHBERT steps forward to
     address the crowd.  He appears drawn and grey.

                              CUTHBERT
                    This has been a tragic and upsetting
                    morning.  I have terrible news for us
                    all.  A member of our security force
                    has been found murdered.  The police
                    have just informed me it was Daniel
                    Beauregard.
                        (murmuring fills the room)
                    Quiet.  Please.  With the help of our
                    head of security, Mr. Ippolito... the
                    museum has been secured.

     IPPOLITO... rises in the back and nods to the crowd... He's an imperious
     looking, pompous man with shifty eyes.  Right now he's defensive.
     Overnight, his job is on the line... 

                              CUTHBERT
                    The police are satisfied we're in no
                    danger, that we're all perfectly
                    safe.  We've been asked to remain in
                    the Gem Room and be available for
                    questioning for the rest of the day.
                    Obviously, we will all do everything
                    we can to cooperate.  Are there any
                    questions?

     Ippolito raises a hand.

                              IPPOLITO
                    The party for the opening of the
                    Superstition Exhibit... I imagine in
                    the light of what's happened it will
                    be pushed back.

                              CUTHBERT
                    No action has been taken yet.  The
                    opening of the exhibit is crucial to
                    the financial health of this museum.
                    So for now, we expect that the
                    Superstition Exhibit will open on
                    schedule, tomorrow night.

     Ippolito registers surprise.  The audience buzzes again.

     INT. GEM ROOM - DAY

     Margo, Dr. Frock and Greg Kawakita enter.  The room is full of
     spectacular displays of gemstones of every type.  Greg drapes himself
     over a grey sofa.  Margo leans on a giant geode.

                              MARGO
                    That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work.
                    Someone's dead and all he cares
                    about is his Superstition Exhibit.

                              FROCK
                    Cuthbert's counting on the
                    exhibition's success.  The museum is
                    in debt.  Contributions and public
                    funding have dried up.  Admissions no
                    longer cover overhead.  The last big
                    infusion of cash we had was the King
                    Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to
                    get us out of the red.  If the
                    Superstition Exhibit isn't
                    lucrative, he'll have to start
                    auctioning off some of these gems.

                              KAWAKITA
                    With all this bad publicity, it's no
                    wonder he looks like that.

     They glance over and see Cuthbert in the corner.  He appears ill, is
     compulsively fingering his watch chain from which hangs a RABBIT'S
     FOOT.  Frock goes over to speak to him, followed by Margo and Greg.

                              FROCK
                    Ian.  Are you okay?

                              CUTHBERT
                        (shakes his head)
                    Beauregard.  I can't believe it.  I
                    may have been the last one to see
                    him alive.  He was with me just
                    yesterday, when I got out the statue
                    of Mbwun.

                              MARGO
                        (taken aback)
                    Mbwun.

                              KAWAKITA
                        (sensing more gossip)
                    What's that?

     Margo frowns, suddenly uneasy.  She and Dr. Frock exchange a look.

                              MARGO
                    Warrior deity of the Kothoga, an
                    extinct South American tribe.  Dr.
                    John Whittlesley led an expedition
                    that found the only known
                    representation of Mbwun.  The statue
                    is said to carry a curse.
                        (she looks away, quiet)
                    Every member of Whittlesley's
                    expedition died.

                              CUTHBERT
                    I got the relic out yesterday to put
                    on display.  Beauregard was there.
                    The crates had been broken into and
                    the contents were strewn about.  But
                    nothing was missing.  It was
                    downright weird.  We joked that it
                    was the curse of Mbwun.  I'm not
                    laughing now.

                              FROCK
                    Come, Ian.  We all know you're
                    superstitious.  But you're among
                    scientists here.  We deal in facts.
                    That statue had nothing to do with
                    what happened to Beauregard.

                              CUTHBERT
                    All I know is, everyone who has come
                    in contact with that relic, is dead.

     INT. BUSINESS OFFICES - MUSEUM - DAY

     D'Agosta has set up a temporary command post among the antique desks
     and chairs.  The room is on the ground floor with a view of the park.
     Gawkers are outside looking in.  D'Agosta pulls the blinds in their
     faces.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (mutters)
                    Get a life.

     Pendergast is looking closely at one of the large paintings of birds
     that line the walls.

                              PENDERGAST
                    An original Roger Tory Peterson of a
                    Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I
                    have a copy of this in my office at
                    home.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Can't really focus on birds at the
                    moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to
                    keep my breakfast down.

                              PENDERGAST
                    In this violent world, I believe the
                    only way to stay sane is to take
                    time to notice beautiful things.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I drink.  After hours of course.  On
                    duty, I smoke.
                        (he pulls out a fat cigar)
                    Do you mind?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a
                    good cigar.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Then you won't like this one.  It's a
                    piece of shit.

     He bites off the end, spits it out on the floor.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Lieutenant --

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Call me Vince.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Did you read about a boat that
                    washed up outside of New Orleans
                    about four months ago?  Twelve bodies
                    on board.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil,
                    wasn't it?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours.
                    All the corpses were badly mutilated
                    in a very particular way.
                    Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs
                    torn to shreds.  It looked like the
                    work of a large animal, but there
                    was no sign of an animal on board.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    So the method of death is the only
                    connection?

                              PENDERGAST
                    No.  There's more.  There were crates
                    from this museum in the hold of the
                    boat.

     BAILEY enters, interrupts.

                              BAILEY
                    Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    It better be good.

                              BAILEY
                    There are a couple of kids who were
                    lost yesterday near the site of the
                    murder.  Claimed they saw a monster.
                    They're pretty determined to tell
                    you their story.  You want to see
                    them?

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (rolls his eyes)
                    No.

                              PENDERGAST
                    If you don't mind, this could be
                    important.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    You're kidding.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Unfortunately, no.

     INT. MUSEUM CLASSROOM - DAY

     A modern classroom that has been taken over by the police for the
     purpose of interrogation.  Seated on small chairs at a plain table
     are... 

     HENRY and LARRY, looking like two little boys with a story they are
     desperate to share.  Standing behind them is MRS. BEASLEY, starchier
     than ever.  D'Agosta takes a chair across from the boys, at their eye
     level.  By this time of day he looks pretty rumpled and tired.
     Pendergast stands upright and unruffled in a doorway behind.  This
     isn't hard duty for D'Agosta.  He's surprisingly genial and at ease
     with kids.  Larry kicks his sneaker against the table leg in
     excitement.  Henry tugs his t-shirt.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Hi.  I'm Lieutenant D'Agosta.  You can
                    call me Vince.  This is Special Agent
                    Pendergast.  You can call him... 
                        (he looks to Pendergast, so formal)
                    Special Agent Pendergast.

                              BEASLEY
                    This is Henry Weiss and Larry
                    Bowers.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    So... Tell us about this monster.

                              LARRY
                    We were lost and trying to find a
                    short cut to the dino--

     Henry elbows him hard.  Larry shuts up.

                              HENRY
                    We were just lost, okay?  And we went
                    down this curvy staircase.  At the
                    bottom was a big shadow.

                              LARRY
                    Big as a house.

                              HENRY
                    Not that big.

                              LARRY
                    Well almost.  Depends which house.  It
                    smelled like old hamburger, and it
                    made this weird noise.

     Henry makes a low GROWL in his throat.  D'Agosta suppresses a smile,
     shoots Pendergast a look.  But Pendergast watches the kids intently.

                              LARRY
                    And it snuffled the ground like a
                    dog.

                              HENRY
                    Like this.

     He goes on hands and knees, sniffs the ground.

                              LARRY
                    It had a long tongue, teeth this big
                    and yellow eyes.

                              HENRY
                    They were green eyes and they were
                    slit like a lizard's.

                              LARRY
                    They were yellow!

                              HENRY
                    You're color blind.

                              BEASLEY
                    Boys, please!
                        (to D'Agosta)
                    These two get in a lot of mischief
                    and they tell some amazing whoppers.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I can see that.

                              HENRY
                    This isn't a whopper!  It's the
                    truth.

     Pendergast now moves forward, pulls up a chair as if deeply
     interested.

                              PENDERGAST
                    How did you get away?

                              HENRY
                    We ran and screamed and stuff.  And
                    we got through a little door just in
                    time.  There was a guard there and he
                    went back to check.

                              PENDERGAST
                    A guard?  Do you remember his name?

                              LARRY
                    He was wearing one of those I.D.
                    badges.  His name was Bo... something.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Beauregard?

                              LARRY
                    Yeah.

     EXT. MUSEUM - DAY

     An ambulance pulls away, lights flashing.  Pendergast and D'Agosta walk
     to a squad car.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I've got to admit, that was a damn
                    sight better than "the dog ate my
                    homework".

                              PENDERGAST
                    How do you explain the part about
                    Beauregard?

                              D'AGOSTA
                    They heard the victim's name and
                    wove him into their story.  Nice
                    touch.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I believed them.

     D'Agosta stops, stunned.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    You think what we've got here is a
                    monster as big as a house that
                    smells... like hamburger?

                              PENDERGAST
                    No.  I think what we've got here is a
                    psychotic killer wielding some kind
                    of unusual weapon... who wants us to
                    believe he's a monster.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (totally confused)
                    Oh.

     INT. NEW YORK CITY MORGUE - EVENING

     D'Agosta and Pendergast thread their way down a hall lined with bodies
     on gurneys.  It's dark and quiet.  They go into the autopsy room.

     INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - AFTERNOON

     A large gurney, currently empty, sits like an uninvited guest under
     the bright lights of the autopsy suite.  Beside it is a tall, imposing
     doctor in her late 50's, with intense eyes.  This is DR. ZIEWZIC.  With
     her are the PHOTOGRAPHER seen passing out at the museum, and a young
     intern, DOCTOR GROSS.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    You're late, Vince.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Sorry Dr. Ziewzic.  This is Special
                    Agent Pendergast.  Pendergast, Dr.
                    Ziewzic.  She runs the best chop shop
                    in New York.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards
                    you sent me that amazing case of
                    Chateau Lafitte.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I hope you liked it.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    Lovely bouquet.  After our last case,
                    Vince took me out for a draft beer.
                    As I recall we split the check.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (grumbles)
                    It's been one of those days.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                        (she snaps her rubber glove)
                    Shall we get down to it, then?

     Dr. Gross wheels the gurney over to the morgue bank and slides open a
     drawer.  The shape under the plastic seems too small to be human.  To
     the side of it is a large bump, presumably the head.  The two pieces of
     cadaver are slid onto the gurney and wheeled under the lights.  A
     stainless steel bucket is placed under the gurney's outlet pipe.  Dr.
     Ziewzic fiddles with a microphone hanging above the body, she taps it
     and it gives off the proper static.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                        (for the microphone)
                    This is Dr. Matilda Ziewzic,
                    assisted by Dr. Frederick Gross.
                    It's Oct. 28, six fifteen p.m.  We
                    are joined by Lieutenant Vincent
                    D'Agosta of the NYPD, Special Agent
                    Pendergast of the FBI and a police
                    photographer.  Let's see what we've
                    got.

     They pull off the sheet and D'AGOSTA swallows hard, closes his eyes to
     keep his stomach in check.  The photographer goes green, but is
     determined not to clutch this time.  PENDERGAST leans closer, totally
     impassive.  He puts on a small pair of wire rim glasses, assumes an
     expression much like a man reading a menu in a restaurant.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    Caucasian male.  Age about 27.  Blond.
                    Height well I can't give a height
                    because Mr. Beauregard has been
                    decapitated.  The state of the body
                    is such that other identifying marks
                    are out of the question.  There are
                    numerous lacerations proceeding from
                    the left anterior pectoral downwards
                    through the sternum and terminating
                    in the abdomen.  This is a massive
                    wound, two feet long and a foot
                    wide.  The head has suffered severe
                    trauma and the occipital portion of
                    the calavarium has been crushed and
                    removed.  It almost looks like... 

                              DR. GROSS
                        (beat)
                    A bite.

     Ziewzic turns to Pendergast.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    What are we talking about here?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Someone who makes the Hacksaw
                    Murderer look like Mother Teresa.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    Right.
                        (back to work)
                    The entire brain appears to have
                    been extracted.  May I see it,
                    please?

     Gross passes over a grey, watery mass that sits in a stainless steel
     pan.  Ziewzic studies Beauregard's brain, or what's left of it... 

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    Curious.  There's something missing.

                              PENDERGAST
                    The thalamus and the hypothalamus,
                    perhaps?

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                        (looks up, surprised)
                    Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut
                    have been removed with what looks
                    like surgical precision.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What happened to them?

                              PENDERGAST
                    If you don't mind a suggestion, you
                    might try a saliva test.

     Ziewzic, Gross and D'Agosta look at Pendergast.  The photographer is
     staring at the wall, silently mouthing multiplication tables to keep
     from woofing all over the place.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (incredulous)
                    Saliva test?  You mean, you think
                    someone ate part of the brain?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Correct.

     A long moment of silence, then... Zwiezic uses a swab for the saliva
     test, puts the result in a petrie dish.

                              DR. ZWIEZIC
                    Okay.  One saliva test.  Now... let's
                    look at these lacerations.  They
                    start wide and then converge.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Long fingernails?  Scratches?

                              DR. ZWIEZIC
                    Too extreme.  Perhaps some kind of
                    weapon.  I'm now probing the wound
                    and... there's a piece of foreign
                    material deep in the muscle, lodged
                    on a rib.  Photograph.

     The photographer gathers his courage, steps forward with D'Agosta and
     Pendergast.  Zwiezic rinses the object off in a beaker of sterile
     water.  It turns brownish red.  She holds it up.  They all stare in
     astonished silence.  D'Agosta swallows.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Sweet Jesus.

                              DR. ZWIEZIC
                    It's a claw.

     The photographer's flash goes off.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

     A black and white heads uptown.

     INT. COP CAR - NIGHT

     Pendergast sits in silence.  D'Agosta is visibly disturbed.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I don't like animals.  Never have.
                    Dog bit me when I was little.  After
                    that I gave up on pets.  Animals are
                    irrational.  Give me a psychotic
                    killer any day.  If there's one thing
                    that makes me queasy it's being part
                    of a food chain.  My first case as a
                    rookie, two brothers climbed a fence
                    at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over
                    ninety.  The polar bear was inside
                    his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in
                    there.  All they saw was the pool.
                    They got to swimming and splashing.
                    The noise woke up the bear.  By the
                    time I arrived, both little boys
                    were in pieces.  The bear was
                    dragging one kid around by the foot.
                    I can still hear the mother
                    screaming --

                              PENDERGAST
                    This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've
                    been on this case four months,
                    remember?  I've learned a few things.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    You've been holding out on me
                    Pendergast.  You have a suspect
                    capable of this?

     Pendergast looks over, nods quietly.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Let me tell you about it, Vince.

     EXT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DUSK

     The yellow crime scene tape is torn and flapping in a light rain.  Most
     of the emergency vehicles have left.  The police have released the
     employees who are now headed home.  We see Frock and Kawakita exit.
     Cuthbert isn't far behind.  Pendergast approaches them, headed back
     inside.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Excuse me.  Has Dr. Green left?

                              KAWAKITA
                    Before eight?  You must be joking.
                    She's in the physical anthro lab
                    making up for lost time.

     Pendergast nods his thanks.

     INT. MUSEUM HALL OF THE GEMS - NIGHT

     The gems glow in the darkness as Pendergast passes through the now
     empty room.

     INT. METEORITE ROOM - NIGHT

     Pendergast's footfalls are lost in the carpet as he goes down the far
     stairs.

     INT. HALLWAY - MUSEUM - NIGHT

     Pendergast goes down a long, dark hall alone.  He arrives at a door
     marked PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB, enters.

     INT. PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB - NIGHT

     The skeletons throw odd shadows on the ceiling.  Margo's computer
     screen glows at the end of the room, casting the only light.  But her
     chair is empty.  The room is quiet.  Pendergast approaches slowly, looks
     around.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Dr. Green?

     No answer.  Pendergast glances at the computer screen, sees graphs and
     complicated notations.  He scrolls down, leans closer.  He can't figure
     it out.  He slides into Margo's chair, fascinated.  Then... 

                              MARGO (OS)
                    You have a warrant to look at that?

     Pendergast leaps up.  Margo has appeared in the doorway behind him, a
     cup of coffee in her hand.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
                    Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping.
                    What is this?

                              MARGO
                    An invention of mine.  It's a
                    computer program designed to
                    describe the characteristics of a
                    given species from a reading of its
                    DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence
                    Extrapolator.

                              PENDERGAST
                    How does it work?

                              MARGO
                    With a DNA analysis from a fossil
                    you can use this program to tell the
                    species and sex of the animal,
                    whether it was nocturnal, what it
                    ate, how it hunted, how big it
                    was... 
                        (abrupt)
                    You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.

                              PENDERGAST
                    No.
                        (a moment)
                    I came to talk about Dr. John
                    Whittlesley.

     Margo turns to put down her coffee.  She takes a moment to compose
     herself.  When she turns back, her voice is quiet.

                              MARGO
                    Somehow, when all this happened... I
                    knew it would come back to John.  Is
                    he really dead?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Maybe not.

                              MARGO
                    If he were alive he'd have contacted
                    me.

                              PENDERGAST
                    You have time to talk?

     INT. MUSEUM HALLS - NIGHT

     Pendergast and Margo walk together though various exhibits and halls.
     They pass dioramas of ferocious wild animals that have been tamed and
     stuffed behind glass.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in
                    Belem, Venezuela a week after the
                    rest of his expedition disappeared.
                    A taxi driver drove him to the
                    harbor where he boarded a cargo
                    boat.  That boat washed up in my
                    district.  Everyone on board was
                    killed.

                              MARGO
                    And John?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Disappeared.  His body wasn't among
                    the victims.

                              MARGO
                    I don't understand.

                              PENDERGAST
                    The people killed were mauled and
                    their brains were eaten.  Just like
                    Beauregard.  One part of the brain
                    was extracted with surgical
                    precision.  The hypothalamus and
                    thalamus to be exact.

     Margo pales.

                              MARGO
                    John couldn't have anything to do
                    with a horrible thing like that.  He
                    was a fine man despite his
                    problems --

                              PENDERGAST
                    You loved him.

                              MARGO
                        (a moment, taken aback)
                    Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John
                    held the Cadwalader Chair in
                    Statistical Paleontology when I was
                    a grad student there.

                              PENDERGAST
                    You were going to be married.

                              MARGO
                    How did you know that?

                              PENDERGAST
                    I ran an internet search on Dr.
                    Whittlesley.  Got a list of his
                    scholarly articles and the
                    engagement announcement in the
                    Times.  I also found a record of your
                    restraining order.

                              MARGO
                    That was two years ago.  John was
                    still in love with me.
                        (she looks down)
                    He wouldn't leave me alone.

                              PENDERGAST
                    You were afraid of him, weren't you?

                              MARGO
                    He was afraid of himself.  He tried
                    suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic
                    depressive.  He had wild emotional
                    highs and lows.  Not a happy
                    affliction for a scientist.  He'd
                    been revered in our community.  By
                    the end he was a joke.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Tell me about the last expedition.
                    What was he looking for?

                              MARGO
                    A legendary monster called Mbwun.

                              PENDERGAST
                    A monster?

                              MARGO
                    Yes.  He developed his own theory
                    that he called the Calisto Effect.
                    It held that evolution wasn't always
                    gradual or driven by natural
                    selection.  The environment would
                    sometimes cause sudden and grotesque
                    changes which could result in a
                    "monster species".  It made no sense.
                    But he felt he had evidence that
                    Mbwun was such a monster, living in
                    isolation on the tepui for thousands
                    of years.

                              PENDERGAST
                    What happened?

                              MARGO
                    No one knows.  The Kothoga who live
                    on the tepui are cannibals.

     Margo's voice catches again.  Pendergast reaches for his handkerchief
     but she shakes her head, determined to keep control.

                              MARGO
                    No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this
                    affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get
                    help.  His ego endangered the lives
                    of others.  His theory came first.

                              PENDERGAST
                    What if Whittlesley arrived on the
                    tepui and no monster was there?  Was
                    he desperate enough to create one?

                              MARGO
                    I don't understand.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Something came up in autopsy
                    tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's
                    body we found a claw.

                              MARGO
                    My God.  Then it was an animal.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I don't think so.  I think we were
                    meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did
                    Whittlesley's monster have claws?

                              MARGO
                    I don't know.  He sent back a statue
                    that's supposed to be an exact
                    representation.  But I've never seen
                    it.  It's in the exhibit.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Would you mind showing it to me?

     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT

     This exhibit is unlike anything we've seen in the museum.  Horrifying
     artifacts under single spots appear to float in a velvet blackness.
     Patterns of light and shadow play over skeletons and voodoo dolls.
     There are tombs, a torture chamber, and endlessly curving, maze-like,
     winding halls.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Where would we find it?

                              MARGO
                    I'm not sure.  We should split up.
                    You take that hall and I'll take
                    this one.

                              PENDERGAST
                    All right.  I'm as macho as you are.
                    Perhaps.

     Without further discussion, Margo takes the right fork leaving
     Pendergast behind.

     ON MARGO... 

     As she finds herself alone.  The silence is intense.  She heads slowly
     into another long, dark, tunnel passing a set of Maori tattooed heads.
     The eyes are stuffed with fibers, the shriveled lips are drawn back
     from rotting teeth.  Margo passes without a look.

     ON PENDERGAST

     In another part of the exhibit, he nears a Mayan tomb.  A skeleton in
     the center wears a headdress and tribal robes.  Gold rings encircle
     bony fingers.  Pendergast takes a moment to appreciate it, heads into
     the next hall.

     ON MARGO

     getting farther from pendergast, and ever deeper into the gloom.  The
     walls around her are lined with symbols of witchcraft.  There are
     shaman dancers, masks covered in grasses and shells.  From the New
     Guinea coast there is Kokpah, God of a secret male society, and Zoe-
     ba, an awesome mannequin in black costume with an angry pointed mask.

     Finally the walls open up into another gallery.  Beyond it is more of
     the shadowy hall.  Margo stops and for the first time she wavers.  This
     gallery is the most frightening yet.  It features images of THE DEVIL
     from different cultures around the world.

     In the dim light, Margo is dwarfed by abhorrent statues of SATAN,
     TORNARSUK (the Eskimo evil spirit), INCUBI from India, Tibet, New
     Guinea etc.  And there in the center of the gallery sitting on an altar
     and lit by a spot, is a small figurine.  Margo is instantly drawn to
     it.  As she gets close enough she sees the label in Gothic letters.

                              MBWUN

                    Savage God of the Kothoga, also
                    known as "HE WHO WALKS ON ALL
                    FOURS".

     The statue is terrifyingly life-like.  Margo stares at The Beast.  Mbwun
     is covered in scales and stiff hair, with glittering green eyes and
     crude, reptilian features.  The figure is hunched over in a threatening
     crouch.  It's long forearms trail to the ground ending in THREE LARGE
     CLAWS!

     ON MARGO... she starts, then remembers Pendergast.

                              MARGO
                    Mr. Pendergast!  I found it.

     No answer.  She turns, tries again, louder.

                              MARGO
                    Pendergast!  Over here --

     Her voice catches as she stops and sniffs the air.  A STENCH rolls over
     her.  She covers her face, backs up, holding her breath.

                              MARGO
                    What the... 

     She steps directly into a nasty statue of the Tibetan lord of the
     Dead.  Margo starts, steadies the statue.  The room is silent once more.
     But then, unmistakably... she hears it.  An odd rustling sound.  Slow.
     Deliberate.  Maddeningly soft on the thick carpet.  And another wave of
     THE SMELL.  Margo looks in the direction she came, down the long dark
     hall.  Her voice comes out a bit frightened as she calls... 

                              MARGO
                    Pendergast?
                        (no answer)
                    Who's there?

     But now she freezes.  At last she's truly scared.  A shadow, black
     against black, is gliding stealthily towards her, moving over the
     display cases and grinning artifacts!

     Margo stands stock still, her eyes on the shadow.  She lets out a small
     gasp of shock.  She can't believe her eyes.  It defies reason.  Slowly,
     she backs up.  She slips quietly through the exhibit and out the other
     side.  In the next room she pauses again, listens... now hearing a
     distinctly animal, SNUFFLING SOUND!

     Something large is TRACKING HER!  There's no doubt.

     Overcome by a blind panic, Margo turns and runs.  She passes through a
     display on mythical creatures, disappears down another winding dark
     hall.

     Behind her comes... 

     THE POUNDING OF SOMETHING IN A HEAVY, LOPING RUN!  Whatever it is, it's
     charging after her!  She turns another corner.  And another, tearing as
     fast as she can!  But now the walls up ahead are narrowing, leading to
     ... a DEAD END!

     Margo slams up against a locked door with a window of glass.  The hall
     features displays of terrifying totem poles.  All around the ghoulish
     carved faces seem to leap out!  She pounds on the door but it's
     useless.  She's trapped.  And the thing is coming behind her!  It's just
     around the last bend when it stops!  Silence again envelops her.  She's
     afraid to turn.  She can hear HEAVY BREATHING, and something like a low
     growl!  Reflected in the glass of the door in front of her is the long
     dark hall.  Margo starts as a face appears IN THE REFLECTION... 

     The image is wavering and unclear.  It's a large, hulking form behind
     her!  TWO GLOWING SLIT GREEN EYES in the dark!  Margo SCREAMS as the
     thing leaps forward, hitting one of the totem poles.  Margo sinks to
     the ground, unconscious.  At last we hear Pendergast calling as
     darkness falls.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Dr. Green!  Dr. Green!

     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT

     ON MARGO... lying on the carpet.  There's a large, nasty bump on her
     forehead.  The totem pole is on the floor beside her.  Leaning over her
     is PENDERGAST.  Margo starts to sit up.  Pendergast gently restrains
     her.

                              PENDERGAST
                    What happened?

                              MARGO
                    I don't know.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I heard you calling and I ran after
                    you, but you kept disappearing and I
                    couldn't keep up.

                              MARGO
                        (she touches her forehead)
                    You were behind me?  Running after
                    me?

     Pendergast nods.  As Margo rises he tries to help her but she waves him
     off, collecting her thoughts.

                              MARGO
                    It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember
                    now... It was an animal.  Something
                    large!  I could smell it.  It was
                    hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in
                    the dark.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Where did you see it?

                              MARGO
                    Behind me.  Over there.

     Margo turns and points behind her to... 

     A large NORTHWEST COAST INDIAN MASK.  It's carved out of wood in a
     horrible grimace, inset with two glowing green eyes.  Pendergast sees
     it too, says nothing.

                              MARGO
                    That's not what I saw.

                              PENDERGAST
                    All right.  If you're positive.

     She leans against the wall, touches her forehead, panic overcoming her
     again.

                              MARGO (CON'T)
                    I can't think straight at the
                    moment.  I know how crazy this seems.
                    Please, Mr. Pendergast, I need some
                    fresh air.  Could you get me out of
                    here?

     EXT. ROTUNDA FRONT ENTRY - EXHIBIT - NIGHT

     THREE COPS including MCNITT, RODRIGUEZ and ROGERS prepare to enter the
     exhibit.  All are armed.  Margo watches as Pendergast gives them
     instruction.  She appears rattled and confused.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Stay in formation together.  Take it
                    room by room.  Check for footprints,
                    any signs of disturbance.  If you see
                    or hear anything the least bit
                    suspicious, I want to know.

     He points to DOYLE, an older red-haired cop who takes up a post
     outside the exhibit.  Pendergast hands Doyle his walkie talkie.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Bailey's going to be in the guard
                    house outside.  Officer Van Dorn is
                    right down that hall.  When McNitt's
                    done, he'll relieve you.

     Doyle nods.  Pendergast and Margo walk out.

     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

     Margo and Pendergast exit.  The cold air is like a slap in the face.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Dr. Green... 

                              MARGO
                    I didn't imagine it.  I know what I
                    saw.  Are you sure there are enough
                    men in there?

                              PENDERGAST
                    They're all heavily armed.

                              MARGO
                        (stops)
                    All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm
                    a scientist.  I like order and logic.
                    Sometimes too much.  There's got to
                    be an explanation.  There can't be an
                    animal in there.  But I saw
                    something.

                              PENDERGAST
                    What was it?

                              MARGO
                    I don't know.
                        (she has a thought)
                    Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get
                    me a DNA readout on that claw.

     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

     All is quiet.

     INT. MUSEUM FRONT - EXHIBIT FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

     The doors to the exhibit are closed.  Doyle looks at his watch,
     impatient.  It's almost eleven now.  He pulls out his walkie talkie.

                              DOYLE
                    Bailey?  Doyle here.  I'm still
                    waiting outside the exhibit.  Where
                    the hell is McNitt?

                              BAILEY
                    Should be there any minute.  They
                    came out a side door a while ago.
                    Said the exhibit's clear.  McNitt's
                    headed back to spell you.

                              DOYLE
                    I'm on double over-time, man.

                              BAILEY
                    I know.  You can go home if you want
                    to.  I'll come relieve you myself.

     Doyle shuts off his walkie talkie, frowns.  He fidgets, looks at his
     watch once more.

                              DOYLE
                    What the hell.

     He turns, takes off the walkie talkie and leaves it, but then he hears
     something, stops.  It's a low SCUFFLING from inside the exhibit, coming
     from behind the closed doors.  Doyle freezes, turns.

                              DOYLE
                    McNitt?

     No answer.  Doyle pauses.  His hand goes to his gun for reassurance as
     he hears a footstep and a muffled thump.  He moves to the door of the
     exhibit, opens it and takes a step inside.

                              DOYLE
                    McNitt?  Cut the crap.  I know it's
                    you.  You're not scaring me.  Come on.

     Silence meets him.  The shadows of the exhibit loom.  Doyle takes one
     more step inside, scanning the darkness with his gun.  Does he hear
     BREATHING?  He freezes.  Yes, he does.  The hair on his neck rises and he
     loses the spit in his mouth.  He takes a step backwards, but he's half
     a second too late.  The door SLAMS BEHIND HIM and a HUGE DARK FORM
     LEAPS OUT!

     INT. EXHIBIT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

     Officer MCNITT enters from a side corridor, zipping up his fly.  The
     hall is still.  McNitt checks his watch, sees Doyle's walkie talkie and
     turns it on.

                              MCNITT
                    McNitt here.  I'm outside the
                    exhibit.  All's quiet.  But I don't
                    see Doyle.

                              BAILEY (OS)
                    He called a minute ago looking for
                    you.  He starts vacation tomorrow and
                    he wanted out.  I said you were on
                    the way.  He could split.

                              MCNITT
                    Well he's gone.

                              BAILEY (OS)
                    Any sign of a green-eyed monster?

                              MCNITT
                        (chuckles)
                    Nope.

     McNitt shuts off the walkie talkie, settles at his post.

     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT

     In the blackness a large shape is MOVING QUIETLY, dragging it's prey
     across the floor.  We move in on the lifeless form of DOYLE.  His face
     is rigid with terror, his eyes frozen, open wide.  The last thing we
     hear as the hulking form heads back into the darkness, is the SNAPPING
     of Doyle's skull.

     EXT. MUSEUM - DAY

     Signs announce that the Superstition Exhibit opens tonight.  The museum
     is back in business, but not many people are going in.  A crowd lingers
     at the margins, pointing at the building.  Several hold a copy of the
     POST with a graphic photo of the bloody floor by the circular stair.

     INT. CUTHBERT'S OFFICE - DAY

     Cuthbert stands by the window of his palatial office, looking out at
     the scene below.  His face is pinched with worry.  Slumped in a chair is
     Lieutenant D'Agosta.  Pendergast surveys some paintings on the wall.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I had no idea the Museum had a
                    complete collection of Piranesi's
                    Forum sketches.

                              CUTHBERT
                    If you like them, they're for sale.
                    Another day like yesterday and half
                    the collection will be on the block.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I've read about the Museum's
                    financial troubles.

                              CUTHBERT
                    We've been operating in the red for
                    years.  That was the whole idea
                    behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It
                    was designed to pull people in.
                    We've spent every penny we have on
                    advance publicity, betting
                    everything on the opening's success.
                    If we postpone at the last minute... 
                    No.  I don't want to think about
                    that.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (chews on his toothpick, mild)
                    We all love the museum.  I come here
                    myself with my kids.  We're trying to
                    work with you.

                              CUTHBERT
                    I appreciate that.

                              PENDERGAST
                    If the party goes forward, and
                    that's a big if... I've arranged for
                    a large police presence.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Do they have to wear uniforms?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Yes.

                              CUTHBERT
                    I don't want to scare people.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert,
                    we've got bigger problems.  Depending
                    on what we find today, we may have
                    to shut you down.

     Cuthbert looks grim.

     INT. PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB - DAY

     D'Agosta examines the huge centrifuges, autoclaves, electrophoresis
     apparati, monitors, computers etc.  as Margo and Greg Kawakita look at
     the claw.

                              KAWAKITA
                    What do you make of it, Margo?

                              MARGO
                    It's not mammalian, that's for sure.
                    I think it's reptilian.

                              PENDERGAST
                    That would jive with what we got
                    from the preliminary DNA read-out.
                    Here, have a look.

     He hands them a computer read-out.  Margo checks it quickly as Kawakita
     looks on.

                              MARGO
                    According to this, twenty-five
                    percent of the claw DNA is
                    unidentifiable, about a third is
                    homo sapien, and the rest is
                    Hemidactylus Turcicus.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (looks over)
                    What's that?

     Margo pulls off her glasses.

                              MARGO
                    Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same
                    strand?  Impossible.  The sample must
                    be contaminated.

                              MARGO
                    There's another possibility.  A lot
                    of repeated base pairs could suggest
                    a high level of genetic damage.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Genetic damage?

                              MARGO
                    When DNA is defective, it often
                    uncontrollably replicates long
                    repeating sequences of the same base
                    pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can
                    radiation, certain chemicals.  Even
                    cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it
                    out.  I have to get started.  This
                    will take several hours.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We need someone to take us to the
                    secure storage area.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Try Dr. Frock.  He's the curator of
                    Plant Biology.  All the curators
                    have keys.  And he knows every inch
                    of this museum.  The rest of us still
                    get lost.

     INT. MUSEUM HALLWAY AREA - DAY

     Pendergast, D'Agosta and Dr. Frock get off are in an older, plain
     corridor with a long row of locked heavy steel doors.  The doors are
     numbered up to eight, then the corridor turns.

     As the three go forward, the creaking of the wheelchair echoes faintly
     in the hall.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Thank you for taking the time to
                    help us with this, Dr. Frock.

                              FROCK
                    Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough
                    these days.  According to security,
                    Beauregard put the Whittlesley
                    crates in storage area 1012.

                              PENDERGAST
                    How many storage areas are there?

                              FROCK
                    They fill seven floors.  We have the
                    largest collection of mammals and
                    dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give
                    you an idea, there are more than
                    three million insects specimens.  Not
                    to mention amphibians, reptiles,
                    birds, anthropological artifacts,
                    meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only
                    about five percent of the museum
                    collection is actually on display.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    This place is a maze.

                              FROCK
                    I'm one of the few who know every
                    inch it, now that John is gone.

                              PENDERGAST
                        (looks over)
                    Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?

                              FROCK
                    Yes.  John made quite a study of the
                    whole museum.  He had a copy of my
                    original plans.

     Frock heads through a double door that leads to a FREIGHT ELEVATOR
     that's as big as a small room.  The operator, KARL has it decorated
     with a table, chair, and PICTURES.

                              MARGO
                    Osteo prep, Karl.

     The doors creak closed.  They are now inside... 

     INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY

     Headed down.  D'Agosta chews on a toothpick, stares at Karl's home-made
     picture show.  The photos have all been cut from nature magazines.  They
     are of ANIMALS MATING in extreme positions and undreamed of ways.
     D'Agosta turns to Pendergast, dead pan.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    My kind of art.

     Karl, who is sixty and wears a red toupee, leers.

                              KARL
                    They keep me company.  Gets kinda
                    lonely sometimes.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    My favorite is the two camels.

                              KARL
                    Really?  I'm partial to the skunks.

     Finally the doors open and they exit to a hail, enter another set of
     doors.  Now they are in

     INT. OSTEOLOGICAL PREPARATION AREA - DAY

     It looks more like a bizarre industrial kitchen than anything else.
     Deep stainless steel tanks line one wall.  On the ceiling near the
     tanks hang massive pulleys and grappling hooks for the larger
     carcasses.  In a far corner of the workshop is a stainless-steel gurney
     bearing a DEAD GORILLA.  A pink faced eighty year old man is working on
     the carcass with sharp tools.  This is DON OSTERBAAN.

                              FROCK
                    Did you ever wonder where we get all
                    our skeletons?  This is the
                    laboratory where animal carcasses
                    are reduced to bones.
                        (to Osterbaan)
                    What's cooking today, Don?

                              DON
                    Zebra.

     Frock looks into a large maceration tank with Pendergast and D'Agosta.
     A zebra carcass can be seen under the muddy surface, its flesh and
     soft tissues falling off.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Man, that's ripe.

     Frock now opens the door on a humid closet adjacent to the main room.
     Inside on a stainless steel table lies the corpse of a fox.  It's
     crawling with BLACK BEETLES which are devouring it.  D'Agosta and
     Pendergast watch the grizzly scene, properly impressed.

                              FROCK
                    Dermestid beetles.  The second method
                    of preparing a skeleton, used in
                    Natural History Museums world wide.
                    Bugs are clean and highly efficient.
                    They'll polish that fox off in no
                    time.

     As Don casually peels back the gorilla's whole face exposing the
     skull... 

                              OSTERBAAN
                    Want to have a look at a gorilla
                    brain?  Got one right here.

                              FROCK
                    Thanks Don.  We're in a hurry.  Some
                    other time.

     INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     More rows of stainless steel doors under hissing steam pipes.  The
     light is dim here, and several bulbs are burned out.  But the numbers
     on the storage rooms are much higher now.  The three men come out of
     the darkness.  Frock rounds a last corner and wheels to a stop.

                              FROCK
                    This should be it.  Can you read the
                    number?

     Pendergast reaches up above them and TAPS THE LIGHT BULB.  It comes on
     and they all see the heavy steel door of the storage area.  D'Agosta's
     jaw drops and his toothpick falls out.  The door has been scored from
     top to bottom by long, vicious, CLAWS!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Holy shit.

     Frock stares in amazement, shaken.  He runs a finger down the deep
     ruts.

                              FROCK
                    Something tried to get into this
                    room!

                              PENDERGAST
                    And failed.  These doors are solid
                    steel.

                              FROCK
                    This means there must be an animal
                    loose in the museum!

                              PENDERGAST
                    I wouldn't be so sure.

     Pendergast takes Frock's keys and opens the door.  It swings wide on
     oiled hinges.  D'Agosta turns on a light.

     INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

     They all enter.  Nothing has been disturbed.  The crates sit in the
     middle of the small room, untouched.  Pendergast kneels by the only one
     that's been opened.

                              PENDERGAST
                    This must be the one that held the
                    statue.  Let's see what else is
                    inside.

     Pendergast removes the lid and hands it to D'Agosta, pulls out a BLOW
     DART GUN, SEED PODS, a CARVED STONE.  D'Agosta takes the lid and turns
     it.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    The lid of this crate is scratched
                    with claw marks, just like the door.

     As D'Agosta studies the lid, a brittle, water damaged envelope slips
     out.  D'Agosta picks it up.  The envelope bears an imprint of TWO
     ARROWS, one silver overlaid with another of GOLD.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Look.  It's some kind of letter.

                              FROCK
                        (excited)
                    May I see that?

     D'Agosta hands the letter to Frock.

                              FROCK
                    It's from John.  Those two arrows
                    were his insignia.  It's addressed to
                    Louis Moriarty, a patron who
                    financed his expeditions.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Read it out loud.

                              FROCK
                    "Dear Louis,
                    	Tomorrow we go to the south
                    end of the tepui where we'll be in
                    the greatest danger, so I'm sending
                    Carlos back with the crates.  You
                    always believed in me, Louis, even
                    in the darkest days.  So it gives me
                    great pleasure to tell you your
                    faith has been rewarded.  We've made
                    an incredible find.  I enclose a
                    representation of Mbwun.  Note the
                    exaggerated claws, the reptilian
                    attributes, the hints of bipedalia.
                    It's beyond belief, but this statue
                    is accurate.  I know because I've
                    seen the beast."

     Frock stops, looks up at D'Agosta and Pendergast.  His face flushes
     with the thrill.

                              FROCK
                    Did you hear that?  My God.  He says
                    that Mbwun is real!

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (snorts)
                    Pardon my French, but bull shit.

                              FROCK
                    This on top of the scratches... isn't
                    it proof!

                              PENDERGAST
                    I think the scratches were put there
                    to scare us.  Perhaps even lead us to
                    this note.

     Pendergast looks out to the dark corridors.

                              PENDERGAST
                    You said John Whittlesley made a
                    study of your blueprints of the
                    museum.

                              FROCK
                    Yes.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Are there any hidden rooms or
                    staircases?  Places where someone
                    could hide?

                              FROCK
                    Not really.  Just the sub-basement.

     D'Agosta and Pendergast exchange a look.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Where is that?

                              FROCK
                    I don't know.  It was walled over.  No
                    one's been down there in years.

                              PENDERGAST
                    You said you had plans of the
                    museum.  Could we see them, please?

     EXT. MUSEUM SIDE DOOR - DAY

     A series of boxes labeled "PROFESSOR FROCK" sit on the loading dock.  A
     small moving van, partially loaded with the contents of Frock's
     office, sits waiting.  Frock delves through one of the boxes while
     Pendergast and D'Agosta look on.

                              FROCK
                    I know they're here somewhere.  It's
                    a good thing we caught the movers in
                    time.  They're nineteen century
                    blueprints from when the museum was
                    built.  I remember the sub-basement
                    was below the regular basement,
                    linked to the city sewer.  I only
                    know about it because it flooded all
                    the way up to the museum during the
                    hurricane of '49.  I lost so many
                    precious books.

     Frock continues to unload boxes, scattering things right and left.
     It's the most amazing assortment of paraphernalia.  A collection of
     wildflowers, soil samples, a stuffed owl.  Finally he pulls out some
     very old blueprints and flashes a triumphant smile.

                              FROCK
                    Eureka.  Who says it doesn't pay to
                    be a pack rat?  Now please be careful
                    with these.  When you're done, I'd
                    like them back.

     INT. HALL OF THE AFRICAN MAMMALS - DAY

     Visitors scatter as Pendergast enters with D'Agosta, TWO DEPUTIES, a
     dog handler, JONATHAN HAMM and Jonathan's pair of HUGE BLOODHOUNDS.
     The deputies are armed with large shotguns.  Pendergast scans the
     blueprints as they walk.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    How big is the sub-basement?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Apparently it's huge.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I think I should come with you.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We haven't got time.  You have to
                    meet with museum security so we can
                    make a decision about tonight.

     INT. MUSEUM - STAIRCASE - DAY

     Pendergast, Jonathan, his dogs and the deputies make their way down an
     industrial set of stairs into the basement.

     INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

     In a moment they arrive at the site of Beauregard's murder.  The area
     at the bottom of the spiral stairway is still littered with chalk,
     crime tape, spray paint and the remains of scores of people tramping
     in and out.

                              PENDERGAST
                    These plans indicate there's a
                    walled over entrance to the sub-
                    basement right around here.

     They move carefully down the dark corridor which we remember from the
     time we last saw it with Henry and Larry.  Unknown to Jonathan or
     Pendergast, the dogs are walking directly towards the spot where the
     boys faced the monster.

                              JONATHAN
                    The dogs are picking up something,
                    Mr. Pendergast.

     The dogs start barking in animation, sniffing the wall.  Pendergast
     studies the blueprints with a flashlight, moves to the spot.  There's
     nothing to be seen.  He shines his flashlight over the water-stained,
     uneven stucco between two steel beams.  The dogs sniff furiously at the
     point where the wall meets the floor.  Pendergast moves his fingers to
     the joint between the stucco and the beam, shoves hard.  The wall
     pushes back.  It's a door!

     INT. STAIRWELL - SUB-BASEMENT - DAY

     They enter a dank stairwell with brick stairs.  Water drips on the
     walls.

                              DEPUTY ONE
                    What is this?  A dungeon?

     Jonathan looks uneasy, double wraps the dogs' leashes around his
     black-gloved hands.  The two deputies remove their 12 gauges from their
     shoulders.  Then they all follow the animals, descend down the inky
     stairwell.

     INT. SECURITY COMMAND CENTER - MUSEUM - DAY

     The place looks like the control room of a nuclear power plant.  Two
     SECURITY GUARDS monitor a battery of closed-circuit screens.  D'Agosta
     is now accompanied by the pompous head of security, IPPOLITO.  Clearly
     Ippolito feels D'Agosta is pissing on his territory and he's trying to
     assert control.

                              IPPOLITO
                    This huge police presence tonight
                    isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll
                    just scare people off.  I can handle
                    the security behind scenes with this
                    system.  It's state of the art.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    The cops are non-negotiable,
                    Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me
                    how this space station works.

                              IPPOLITO
                    It's fool proof, basically.  I
                    designed this whole thing myself.
                    Every valuable object in the Museum
                    carries a small electronic chip.  If
                    anything's moved so much as an inch,
                    we get an alarm pinpointing the
                    exact location of the attempted
                    theft.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    That's great if you're stopping a
                    burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are
                    there motion detectors?

                              IPPOLITO
                    In every exhibition room.  The
                    museum's divided into five cells.
                    The reception and exhibit are in
                    cell five.  We could arm the motion
                    detectors in cells one to four, then
                    seal the perimeter with our fire
                    doors.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    That would leave one exit for
                    hundreds of people.  You'd be
                    violating every fire regulation on
                    the books.  We'll guard the perimeter
                    with my men and engage the motion
                    detectors in the other cells.  One
                    more question.  I see a big hole.  If
                    this entire thing is run by
                    computer, what happens if the power
                    fails?

                              IPPOLITO
                        (snorts)
                    You don't know much about computers,
                    Lieutenant.  There are safeguards
                    built in.  We have back-up systems
                    with redundancies.  There's no way
                    these computers can fail.
                    
     INT. PHYSICAL ANTHRO LAB - DAY

     Margo, Kawakita and Frock are studying the contents of the crate.

                              FROCK
                    I can't help thinking there's
                    something that Pendergast
                    overlooked.  If the scratches were
                    made by whatever killed Beauregard,
                    it wants something that's in here.

                              MARGO
                    A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant
                    press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.

                              FROCK
                    Let me see the plant press.

     Frock opens the plant press and sees a specimen inside.

                              MARGO
                    What is it?

                              FROCK
                    I'm not sure.  As you know, the
                    Kothoga lived outside civilization
                    on the tepui for thousands of years.
                    Species flourished in isolation when
                    man and pollution rendered them
                    extinct.  This could be one of the
                    last remaining samples of an unknown
                    plant.

                              MARGO
                    Whatever it is, it must be common on
                    the tepui.  John used it as packing
                    material.

                              FROCK
                    You're right.

     Kawakita lifts out a bit of the fibers, as does Frock.

                              FROCK
                    They're curiously fleshy.

                              KAWAKITA
                    And they smell delicious.

     Kawakita TAKES a NIBBLE.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Taste great.

                              FROCK
                    I wouldn't put that in your mouth
                    until we do a chemical analysis,
                    Greg.

                              KAWAKITA
                    I can handle that for you while
                    we're waiting on the G.S.E.

     Kawakita rises and exits with some of the plant.

                              MARGO
                    What about those seed pods?  Are they
                    from the same plant?

     Frock takes a moment to study them, looks up.

                              FROCK
                    Margo, these aren't seed pods.

                              MARGO
                    What are they?

                              FROCK
                    They're eggs.

     INT. SUB-BASEMENT - DAY

     Black as night.  The only light comes from the men's flashlights.
     They're at a crossroads.  Crooked corridors, with arched ceilings
     barely the height of a man stretch in several directions.  Jonathan is
     crouched down, resting with the panting dogs.  The deputies are having
     a smoke.  They all look both uneasy and exhausted except for
     Pendergast.  He stares at the blueprints.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Hard to read in this light.  The ink
                    is so faded.

                              JONATHAN
                    The dogs have lost the scent, Mr.
                    Pendergast.  Maybe we should head
                    back.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the
                    left.

     The men reluctantly shoulder their shotguns and push on.  The hounds
     walk ahead, carelessly nosing the ground.  The flashlight beams
     illuminate lime-encrusted, cave-like walls.

                              DEPUTY TWO
                    This place gives me the creeps.

     At this the dogs begin to WHINE.  The HAIR on their backs rises in a
     ridge.  Pendergast turns as a BREEZE stirs his clothes.

                              JONATHAN
                    They've got something.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Keep the light up.  I can't see.

     The dogs strain and pull forward, sniffing the air ahead.  The deputies
     raise up their shotguns as they all move deeper into the darkness.  The
     flashlight beams streak crazily in all directions, barely penetrating
     the gloom.  Suddenly the dogs break into a terrifying BAYING which
     bounces off the walls.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Shut them up!

                              JONATHAN
                    Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!

     The dogs drag Jonathan forward, paying no attention, foaming at the
     mouth.  Jonathan is now frightened.

                              JONATHAN
                    They're going crazy!  I need help!

     Too late.  As Jonathan tries to grab the collars, one of the dogs LEAPS
     forward, and the leash slips through Jonathan's hands.

                              JONATHAN
                    He's loose!  Argo!

     Argo BOLTS into the darkness.  The men start after the dog, following
     the frantic barking which echoes farther and farther in the distance.
     Pendergast is in the lead.  Suddenly he throws out his arms, halts.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Stop!

                              JONATHAN
                    Holy mother, what is that?

     A goatish odor envelops them all.

                              DEPUTY ONE
                    Smells God-awful.  Like rotten meat.

                              JONATHAN
                    Argo!  Come!

                              PENDERGAST
                    Quiet!

     A SCUFFLING sound of claws dragging on brick is heard followed by a
     ROAR.  The men all freeze.  The other dog leaps and twists with
     excitement.  In the confusion it also breaks free!  It tears after the
     first dog, disappearing into the darkness.  Now Jonathan is wild-eyed.

                              JONATHAN
                    No!  Hobbes!

     The deputies are terrified, retreat.  The darkness is stifling,
     claustrophobic.  The flashlights are small help.  Pendergast alone
     remains dead calm.  His voice is cool and commanding.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Forget the dogs.  You two, get back
                    here.  Don't point that gun at me.

     The deputies regain control and follow Pendergast's orders.  They fall
     into position, pump their shotguns and aim them down the hall.  In the
     echoing darkness ahead of them, the barking falters and stops.

     There is a moment of silence, then a terrible, unearthly SHRIEK.  The
     deputies quail, frozen in their tracks.  Jonathan leaps forward.

                              JONATHAN
                    Argo!  Hobbes!

                              PENDERGAST
                    Get back!  Now!

     At that moment a SHAPE hurtles at them from the darkness!  The men YELL
     in terror.  There are two stunning BLASTS from the shotguns, two
     FLASHES of light accompanied by a deafening roar.  The rumble echoes
     and dies and there's an intense silence, followed by a sob.

                              JONATHAN
                    You shot my dog!

     Hobbes lies five feet from them, a black shadow of death.  Jonathan
     kneels by the dog, tears in his eyes.  Down the animals side is a GASH.

                              JONATHAN
                    My dog... 

                              DEPUTY ONE
                        (stammers)
                    He was coming right at me... 

     In the distance they can hear a terrified howl.  It's the second dog,
     hurt or frightened.  It's a pitiful sound.

                              DEPUTY TWO
                    Let's get out of here!

                              JONATHAN
                    I'm not going anywhere!  Not without
                    my dog!

     Pendergast grabs at Jonathan who slips from his grasp.  Jonathan inches
     back down the hallway calling desperately.

                              JONATHAN
                    Hobbes!

                              DEPUTY ONE
                    Get back!

     Jonathan shakes his head no.

                              JONATHAN
                    There's something out there!  Let's
                    go get it now!  That's why we came
                    down here, isn't it?

                              PENDERGAST
                        (to the deputies)
                    He's right.  Follow me.

     But the two deputies are terrified.  They cling to the wall, inching
     backwards, sheer horror in their eyes.

                              DEPUTY ONE
                    No way.  I say we get help.  A lot
                    more guns.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I'm ordering you!  Cover me!

                              DEPUTY TWO
                    We'll cover you from here!

     Jonathan is disappearing in front of them.  Pendergast has no choice.
     Grim faced, he pulls his Colt .45 Anaconda from a shoulder harness.
     It's a narrow and evil-looking gun.  From a pocket comes a handful of
     255 grain wadcutter and 147 grain FMJ flatnose ammunition.  He loads
     up, goes after Jonathan, who's no longer in sight.  Pendergast passes
     down a long, sloping hallway into cavernous blackness ahead.  At the
     bottom Pendergast stops.  He has to stoop down as he goes through an
     archway and into... 

     A VAST ARCHING ROOM... 

     A dark stream of water runs between concrete walls with tunnels going
     off from all sides.  It appears to be part of the sewer system.  The dog
     cowers in a corner.  Jonathan moves to his side.

                              JONATHAN
                    Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Come on.  Let's get back to the
                    others.  We can't leave them alone.

                              JONATHAN
                    It's alright.  I can tell by the way
                    the dog's acting that whatever was
                    out there is gone.  What is this
                    place?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Not on the map.  Looks like it
                    connects with the city sewer.

     Pendergast calls back down the tunnel for the deputies.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We're coming back!

     The words go unanswered.  From the hall comes a loud REPORT.  It's the
     shotguns, blasting desperately.  Something flies up all around them as
     the sound echoes.  BATS!

     Pendergast and Jonathan shield themselves from the flurry of beating
     wings.  Finally the animals settle and Pendergast and Jonathan exchange
     a look.  The silence is filled by a soft RUMBLING SOUND.  They stand
     together, waiting.  Pendergast points his gun at the hall leading back
     to the deputies.  A ridge of hair on the dog's back rises and it
     growls.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Identify yourself!  Who's there?

     No answer.  The rumbling continues, growing louder.  Then a dark object
     appears.  It comes rolling out of the hallway, bounces in front of them
     and stops.  Pendergast shines his light on... 

     DEPUTY ONE'S HEAD!  The mouth is open wide in terror.  Across the cheek
     is a vicious claw mark.

                              JONATHAN
                    Oh... my... God!

                              PENDERGAST
                        (hisses)
                    Quiet.

     And now they hear a GUT WRENCHING SHRIEK that's abruptly cut off,
     followed by a second rumbling sound!  Jonathan grabs Pendergast by the
     shirt, panicked.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Stay calm.

     They head quietly for the exit at the other end of room which seems to
     slope up.  After they're gone a few moments the head of DEPUTY TWO
     rolls to a stop.

     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

     Cabs and limousines tangle outside the west entrance.  A huge rotating
     SPOTLIGHT is now turned on.  Elegantly dressed men in dinner jackets
     and women in gowns rush to get out of the pelting rain, umbrellas
     jousting.

     INT. CUTHBERT'S OFFICE - EVENING

     Cuthbert's putting on his tux.  He adjusts the cummerbund, humming
     happily as D'Agosta looks on.  D'Agosta paces, highly agitated and
     worried.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I'm telling you, something's wrong.
                    I still haven't heard from
                    Pendergast.  I think you should call
                    it off.

                              CUTHBERT
                    It's too late now.  Guests are
                    arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling
                    up.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I'll go down and speak to him.

                              CUTHBERT
                        (irritated)
                    You haven't got the authority.  Only
                    Pendergast can pull the plug.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't
                    you understand?  He still hasn't come
                    back.  It's been over three hours --

                              CUTHBERT
                    He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good
                    shape.  Your security is air tight.
                    There've been no more incidents,
                    nothing suspicious.  There's no
                    reason to call off the opening now.

     INT. GREAT ROTUNDA - NIGHT

     Resounding with the echoes of several hundred expensive shoes crossing
     the marble expanse and heading down the rows of palm trees leading to
     the Hall of Heavens.  The palms themselves are festooned with orchids
     and violet lights.  Somewhere inside, an invisible band is playing "New
     York, New York".  An army of waiters in white tie thread their way
     through the guests carrying large silver platters crowded with
     champagne glasses.  Cuthbert enters and crosses to meet The MAYOR and
     THE MAYOR'S WIFE.  Photographers step forward and flashbulbs pop.

     INT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT

     Food is out.  Hundreds of tables are set with black linen table cloths.
     Decorations have a dark, haunted house theme.  A hum of activity floats
     up past the vast Corinthian columns into the circular dome above.

     INT. MARGO'S LABORATORIES - NIGHT

     An explosive sneeze rattles the beakers and dislodges the plant
     specimens.  Margo interrupts her work at the computer to hand Greg a
     tissue as Frock looks on.

                              KAWAKITA
                    What kind of egg is it?

                              MARGO
                    It's reptilian.

                              FROCK
                    Like the claw.

                              MARGO
                        (cautious)
                    Let's not jump to conclusions.  This
                    egg could belong to any number of
                    reptiles, Dr. Frock.

                              FROCK
                        (excited)
                    Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge
                    of something huge.  Let's consider
                    the possibility, just the three of
                    us, alone in this room.  What if John
                    was right.  I mean, what if?  And he
                    sent back an egg of his monster in
                    the crates.  When it got to the
                    museum, it hatched.

                              MARGO
                    Several problems with that theory.
                    For one thing, this egg is intact.
                    For another, according to
                    Pendergast, the crates were shipped
                    here on a boat.  Everyone on board
                    was killed like Beauregard.  If the
                    thing hatched in mid-ocean, where
                    did it go?

     Frock has no answer.  Greg gestures to his computer screen.

                              KAWAKITA
                    I guess you're not interested in
                    this plant anymore, but the chemical
                    analysis is done.  Frock reads the
                    computer over Greg's shoulder.

                              FROCK
                    "Genus: Unknown.  Family: Unknown.
                    Order: Unknown.  Phylum: Unknown.
                    Cripes, Margo, what did you give me?
                    Is this an animal or one funky
                    shrub?"
                        (to Kawakita)
                    I see you've been programming the
                    computer vocabulary again.

                              MARGO
                        (points to a hexagonal symbol)
                    Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus
                    protein.  That explains why the
                    computer's confused.  The plant's
                    infected with a virus.

                              FROCK
                    That's not so unusual.  Many plants
                    carry viruses.  Like the burls on
                    Maple trees.

                              MARGO
                    But a virus normally codes for other
                    viruses.  This one's making human and
                    animal proteins.  Listen to this.
                        (reads)
                    "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid.
                    Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4-
                    monoxytocin supressin hormone."

                              KAWAKITA
                    These plant fibers are loaded with
                    hormones!

                              MARGO
                    What kind of hormones?

     Kawakita pulls a heavy book from the shelf.  The Encyclopedia of
     Biochemistry, thumbs to a page and reads.

                              KAWAKITA
                    4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone
                    secreted by the human hypothalamus
                    gland."

                              MARGO
                    Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.

     The tension is rising in the room.  Frock takes the book, looks this
     one up, reads silently and removes his glasses.

                              FROCK
                    A hormone secreted by the human
                    thalamus gland.

     Kawakita and Frock look puzzled.  Margo rises in agitation.

                              MARGO
                    This is it.  This is what he, or
                    it... is after!  The plant has high
                    concentrations of the same hormones
                    found in minute quantities in the
                    human brain!

                              KAWAKITA
                    So what?

                              MARGO
                    Pendergast told me the killer
                    extracts and eats the hypothalamus
                    and thalamus of the victim's brains!

                              KAWAKITA
                        (pales)
                    Eats them?

                              MARGO
                    Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may
                    have lived on this plant.  When the
                    crates were put in secure storage,
                    they were out of reach.  The killer
                    couldn't get them, so it got the
                    next best thing.

                              FROCK
                    Beauregard's head.

     There's a moment of stunned silence.  Then a LOUD BUZZER makes them all
     jump.

                              MARGO
                    It's all right.  That means the
                    G.S.E.  has finished analyzing the
                    claw DNA.  Greg, you go find
                    Pendergast and Lieutenant D'Agosta
                    now.

     INT. MUSEUM HALLWAYS - NIGHT

     Kawakita tears up the dark stairs.  He turns a corner and something
     JUMPS OUT at him.  He almost screams.  It's a DRUNK.

                              DRUNK
                    Hey, where 'za little boys room?

                              KAWAKITA
                    Down that hallway.  But don't stay
                    long.  You don't want to be here
                    alone.

     INT. MARGO'S LAB - NIGHT

     Margo and Frock enter and huddle over a sheaf of papers that the
     printer has spit out.

                              MARGO
                    All right, assuming the program is
                    accurate, this is a description of
                    the animal with that claw.
                        (she reads)
                    "Species unidentified.  Genus:
                    unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male,
                    weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain
                    capacity, 900 centimeters." That
                    means it's highly intelligent.
                    "Quadrupedal."

                              FROCK
                    Quadrupedal!  The other name for
                    Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."

     Margo and Frock exchange a look.  Holy shit.  Margo swallows and keeps
     reading.

                              MARGO
                    "Nocturnal.  External hair and bony
                    plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70
                    kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... 
                    poor eyesight.  "External mucoid
                    nasal glands,"... very keen scent... 
                    "Morphological characteristics:
                    Highly robust.  Aggressiveness:
                    extreme."

                              FROCK
                    So the claw came from a huge
                    creature with a preternatural sense
                    of smell and poor eyesight that
                    hunts at night.

                              MARGO
                    With the intelligence of a human
                    being, the speed of a greyhound, and
                    the strength of a grizzly bear.

                              FROCK
                        (a long moment)
                    Margo, what you've just described is
                    a killing machine.

                              MARGO
                    And it's hungry.  It's been two days
                    since it's eaten.  There are five
                    hundred people arriving right now.
                    The animal hunts at night and it has
                    a keen sense of smell!  All those
                    people in one enclosed space... 

                              FROCK
                    It's like ringing the dinner bell.

     INT. ENTRANCE TO SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - ROTUNDA - NIGHT

     The crowd is now packed into the rotunda as the MAYOR cuts a red
     ribbon across the entrance to the exhibit and everyone applauds.
     Cuthbert is by the mayor's side.  He steps forward and raises his hand
     for quiet.  The crowd falls silent.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Thank you everyone and welcome.
                    We're glad all of you were willing
                    to brave the inclement weather to be
                    with us tonight.  Our special thanks
                    to his honor, the mayor and his
                    lovely wife.

     The Mayor takes a bow.  More applause.

                              CUTHBERT (CON'T)
                    Some people have questioned whether
                    a superstition exhibit belongs in a
                    Museum of Science.  Spells,
                    incantations, demons, magic... these
                    are forces that defy the natural
                    laws.  Superstition provides answers
                    to the great questions based on
                    fear.  Science provides answers to
                    the great questions based on truth.
                    Science and superstition, then, are
                    polar opposites.  Mortal enemies, if
                    you will.  And that is why we are
                    here tonight.  We have come to learn
                    more about the enemy, and thus to
                    bring about its defeat.  For every
                    good, there is an evil, for every
                    dark, a light.  And so tonight... my
                    friends, I give you ignorance,
                    terror, unreasoning fear, pure evil.
                        (smiles, gestures to the exhibit)
                    Have a great time.

     Everyone laughs, applauds again as Cuthbert and the Mayor lead the way
     inside.  Kawakita is making his way over to D'Agosta.  The crush at the
     entrance is incredible.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Lieutenant!  It's me.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What is it?

                              KAWAKITA
                    Dr. Green has to see you!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Got my hands full here.

                              KAWAKITA
                    It's important.  Please.  You have to
                    come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found
                    out something.

     D'Agosta pulls out his walkie talkie.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    McNitt?  D'Agosta here.

     INT. SECURITY COMMAND CENTER - MUSEUM - NIGHT

     Officer McNitt stands in the corner of the computer room, bathed in
     neon light.  Running the security system is GEORGE, your basic computer
     nerd.  Multiple screens all over show various rooms in the museum.  Most
     are empty with the exception of those showing the exhibition.  On
     these, the crowds can be seen entering the various rooms.  McNitt holds
     his walkie talkie.

                              MCNITT
                    Yeah Lieutenant?  I'm here.

                              D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)
                    I'm heading to the Evolutionary Bio
                    labs.  Any sign of Pendergast?

                              MCNITT
                    Not yet.

     At this moment a NOISE comes from the adjoining room.  McNitt's head
     SWIVELS.  It's a LOUD THUMP.

                              MCNITT
                    Hold on Lieutenant.
                        (to George)
                    What was that?

                              GEORGE
                    Probably just something wrong with
                    the air conditioning.  There's a shit
                    load of electrical rooms back there.

     George is playing an elaborate computer game and not paying attention.
     McNitt returns to his walkie talkie as the THUMP comes again.  Now he
     looks distinctly nervous.

                              MCNITT
                    Lieutenant?  There's something wrong
                    in the computer room.

                              D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)
                    Goddamn it.  I'll get Ippolito and
                    send him up.

     George rises.

                              GEORGE
                    You're over-reacting.  Sounds like
                    the air conditioning to me.

     McNitt watches uneasily as George opens the door, disappears into the
     next room.

     INT. ENTRANCE - SUPERSTITION EXIBIT - NIGHT

     D'Agosta turns to Kawakita who waits, shifting from foot to foot.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Damn.  There's some kind of problem
                    in the computer room.  I have to go
                    get Ippolito.  You wait here.

     D'Agosta heads into the exhibit before Kawakita can protest.

     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT

     We see various cuts of people as they move into the different rooms.  A
     TEENAGE GIRL (LAUREN) and her FATHER (DAVID) examine a lidless,
     rotting European style coffin, complete with corpse.  A white haired
     gentleman (DR. POUND), leans on his cane as he looks at a display on
     primitive medicine practiced with implements that look like torture
     tools.

     Cuthbert and Ippolito are at the head of a press of people, giving the
     MAYOR and HIS WIFE a guided tour.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Here we have a very rare sacrificial
                    table from Mesoamerica.  The priests
                    would kill the victim on this slab,
                    cut out the heart and eat it while
                    it was still beating.

                              MAYOR
                    I could use one of these things in
                    City Hall.

     Cuthbert laughs right on cue.  They pass a Congo power figure with its
     bulging eye sockets and torso riddled with sharp nails.  Several people
     recoil from it, looking repulsed.  The MAYOR's WIFE sees it and looks
     distressed.

                              MAYOR'S WIFE
                    You're letting kids see this?  I
                    should think they'd have nightmares.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Kid will love it.  They're our target
                    audience.  Nothing here is as violent
                    as what they see on T.V.

     They pass a MUMMY dripping in BLOOD.  The Mayor gestures to it.

                              MAYOR
                    I don't know.  That could be a little
                    over the top.  It's not even
                    scientific.  Mummies don't bleed.

     Cuthbert's smile fades as he sees the mummy.

     CLOSE ON... the MAYOR'S WHITE CUFF as he extends his hand to point at
     the mummy.  The pristine white of his cuff is suddenly colored by a
     falling RED DROP OF BLOOD.

     Cuthbert sees it.  So does the Mayor and Ippolito.  They look up as
     another DROP OF BLOOD falls right on Cuthbert's face.  And yet another
     droplet falls on THE MAYOR'S WIFE'S white bosom, exposed by her low
     cut dress!

                              CUTHBERT
                    Oh... my... God... 

     THEIR POV... above the mummy's head, the top of the case is cut away,
     exposing a ceiling crawling with steam pipes and ductwork.  A hand, a
     watch, and the cuff of a blue shirt protrude over the edge of the
     case.  A small icicle of blood hangs from the middle finger.  And
     another drop FALLS.

     CUTHBERT SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS!  Conscious of the panic
     factor, Ippolito yells.

                              IPPOLITO
                    Quiet everyone!

     But it's too late.  The room is packed with people.  And D'Agosta
     himself is just pushing through the door as another woman cries out... 

                              WOMAN
                    There's a body up there!

     A ripple of fear goes over the faces in the room, titters as people
     wonder if it's a joke.  At that moment from the darkness above, the
     ceiling buckles and something FALLS!

     It's OFFICER DOYLE'S HEADLESS TORSO, dripping blood!

     UTTER PANDEMONIUM breaks loose!  The close space ECHOES with screams
     and shouts.  People claw at each other, stumbling desperately trying to
     get to the door.  A YOUNG WOMAN falls and D'Agosta runs to her to keep
     her from being trampled in the stampede.

     INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

     McNitt is staring in horror at the remote camera images showing the
     chaos in the exhibition, the faces registering blind fear.  Alarms
     start going off all over the place.  McNitt calls out... panicked... 

                              MCNITT
                    George!  Get out here, now!

     McNitt looks around, desperate.  But George still isn't here.  The door
     to the electrical room is still open.  The ceiling shudders from
     thundering feet.  McNitt can hear distant SCREAMS!  It's raising the
     hair on the back of his neck.  He calls out.

                              MCNITT
                    George!  Where are you?

     No answer.  He moves to the open door, a new fear in his eyes.  He looks
     inside.

     INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT

     BLACKNESS.  McNitt can't find a light switch.  He stays in the doorway,
     silhouetted by light from the computer room.  With shaking hands McNitt
     pumps a slug into the chamber of his shotgun.  There's a strange, low,
     gurgling sound.  It's McNitt's stomach.  He silences it, swallows.

                              MCNITT
                    Hey you?  George!  Damn it.  Where are
                    you?  No response.

     McNitt edges into the darkened rooms.  The first one's empty.  He tries
     the next.

                              MCNITT
                    George!  We've got an emergency!  Are
                    you here?

     Suddenly there's a HUGE THUMP and a scuttling to his left!  It's a
     terrifying sound!  McNitt drops to his knees and pumps three rounds,
     each with a light and a deafening blast!  A SHOWER OF SPARKS and a gout
     of flame licks upwards, illuminating the room with orange light.  A
     HUGE DARK SHAPE ducks out the door!

                              MCNITT
                    Oh God.  Oh God!

     Gunpowder hangs in the air like a blue fog.  On the far wall, a mounted
     metal box is smoking from three large, ragged holes!  With a sudden
     pop, an electrical arc slices across the ruined box, followed by a
     crackling and a shower of sparks.  McNitt ducks back into the computer
     room, slams the door and locks it, breathing hard.

     INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

     Every single screen flickers and dims.  But to McNitt's relief, George
     has returned.  He is sitting with his back to the doorway in his chair.

                              MCNITT
                    George!  I saw something in there!  I
                    fired but I think I missed it!

     George remains still, his back to McNitt, staring at the computer game
     on the flickering screen.

                              MCNITT
                    George, for Chrissake answer me!

     McNitt puts a hand on George's shoulder, swivels his chair around.

     ON GEORGE... His face ripped off.

     INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT

     ON THE CENTRAL SWITCHING BOX... sparking and shorting as an ENORMOUS
     CLAWED ARM SWIPES IT OFF THE WALL!

     INT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT

     Everyone pours out of the exhibit, running for the door leading to the
     Rotunda.  People are getting trampled.  It's a terrible crush.  Screams!
     Tables over-turned everywhere.  Food scatters to the floor.  D'AGOSTA
     pushes his way out of the exhibit, crosses to Kawakita, who is
     appalled.  Above, the chandeliers are flickering.

                              KAWAKITA
                    What happened?!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    There's a dead body in the exhibit!
                    People are panicking, trampling each
                    other trying to get out.

     Ippolito runs over to join them.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What the hell is going on?!

     Above them THE LIGHTS dim again and come back on.

                              IPPOLITO
                    The whole system is shutting down!
                    We have to get out quickly before
                    the fire doors fall!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What doors?

                              IPPOLITO
                    I told you!  They seal off all the
                    cells.  They were designed to fall
                    automatically in a system failure --

                              D'AGOSTA
                    You said the system couldn't fail!

     At this there's a low rumble from above.  D'Agosta looks up and sees A
     LARGE METAL DOOR IS DESCENDING from a slot in the ceiling, and not in
     an orderly fashion.  It's falling fast.  Below are crowds of people, all
     pushing to get out!  Officer Bailey, near the door, sees it.

                              BAILEY
                    Above you!  Look out!

     His voice is lost in an ocean of screaming.  Kawakita stands in total
     horror a moment, then joins Bailey and D'Agosta.

     All of them try to restrain people from trying to beat the door.
     Ippolito, on the other hand, elbows his way to the front of the
     fleeing crowd!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Ippolito!  Get back here!

                              IPPOLITO
                    Like hell!

     Ignoring D'Agosta, Ippolito pushes past.  He barrels over an OLD MAN
     who stumbles and falls DIRECTLY BENEATH THE FALLING DOOR!  Ippolito
     jumps over him and is out!

     The old man looks up at the descending wall of steel and SCREAMS!
     D'AGOSTA runs forward, dives for the old man but he's not in time.

     Kawakita covers his eyes, unable to watch as the lights flicker a
     third and last time.  The room is plunged into darkness.  And over the
     screams we hear the rumble and CRASH, the horrifying cries of the old
     man, as the door comes down.

     INT. MARGO'S LAB - NIGHT

     Margo and Frock stand in the darkness.  Through a high window we can
     see lightning flash.

                              MARGO
                    What's going on?

                              FROCK
                    Some kind of power failure.  Maybe
                    it's the storm.  Do you have a
                    flashlight?

                              MARGO
                    I think so.

     She gets one from a cupboard.

                              FROCK
                    Greg's been gone over a half hour.
                    We'd better get out of here.  Get the
                    crate.

     INT. HALLWAYS - NIGHT

     Frock wheels his chair as fast as he can.  Margo runs beside him
     carrying the crate with the fibers inside.  A peel of thunder ends and
     distant screaming is heard.  Margo stops, appalled.

                              MARGO
                    Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?

                              FROCK
                    Don't stop now.

     Up ahead they hear METALLIC RUMBLING and a CRASH!  They round a corner
     and come up against a huge STEEL DOOR.

                              MARGO
                    What's that?

                              FROCK
                    It's one of the fire doors.  Good
                    Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!

     INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Pendergast stands at the end of a cul de sac, studying the blue prints
     by a stone wall.  Jonathan and the dog are with him, exhausted and
     terrified.  Jonathan keeps an eye on the corridor behind them as
     Pendergast works.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I know where we are now.  We're
                    getting out, Jonathan.  This should
                    be another door.

     Taking a pen knife from his pocket, Pendergast places it into the
     plaster and gently twists the blade.  A piece of plaster the size of a
     dinner plate falls, revealing the tracings of another doorway.
     Pendergast shoves the door open to reveal a dark, dusty room.

                              JONATHAN
                    Hallelujah, Pendergast.  Where the
                    hell are we now?

     INT. "ALCOHOLIC" ROOM - NIGHT

     Jonathan and Pendergast enter quickly from the hidden rear door.
     Pendergast shines his beam on dusty shelves filled with specimens.  All
     are stored in jars of alcohol.  There are fetuses of many different
     species.  We see a pig, a cow, a duck billed platypus as well as brain
     sections, a disembodied monkey head.  One rectangular glass container
     holds a skinned human foot.

                              JONATHAN
                    Jesus, what is this?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Another storage room.

     Pendergast tries the light switch to no effect.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Something's happened.  The power's
                    out.

     They cross the room to the main door and exit.  Now they're in... 

     INT. OSTEO PREP - LAB - NIGHT

     Pendergast shines his light on the maceration tanks.  The humming of
     the bugs can be heard in their cabinet.

                              PENDERGAST
                    All right.  I know where we are.  This
                    is the osteo prep lab.  I was in here
                    earlier.  We're safe now.

     With these words, the dog GROWLS.  Jonathan freezes and sniffs the air.

                              JONATHAN
                    Oh no.  I smell it.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Keep the animal quiet.

     Jonathan kneels by Hobbes as Pendergast listens, every nerve on end.  A
     sound comes from the adjacent hallway that leads to the secure storage
     area.  It's unmistakable HEAVY BREATHING and the creeping movement of
     claws.  Pendergast lifts his gun.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Go out the other doorway.  There's a
                    stair at the end of the hall.  Up
                    five flights is a corridor that
                    leads to the Hall of the Heavens.
                    Find Lieutenant D'Agosta.  Bring
                    help.

     Jonathan doesn't have to be told twice.  He takes the dog and exits
     from the other side of the lab leaving Pendergast alone.  Pendergast
     waits a moment until Jonathan's safely out of sight.  He switches off
     his flashlight, backs up slowly, step by step.  He opens the door to
     the alcoholics storage.  As he slips inside a DARK SHAPE appears.

     INT. "ALCOHOLICS" STORAGE - NIGHT

     Slowly, making no sound, Pendergast lifts the .45 Anaconda, passes his
     finger over the cylinder, checking the loaded chambers.  Then he
     steadies the revolver and levels it at the door.  The hideous pickled
     specimens seem to hover all around him.  The smell is overwhelming and
     the snuffling is louder now.

     It's coming closer.  After a long moment there is a faint bump at the
     door.  This is followed by a low scratching noise... Pendergast watches
     frozen in horror, holding his breath.

     THE DOORKNOB BEGINS TO TURN!  Not knowing what else to do, Pendergast
     simply grabs it from the inside and holds on!

     OUTSIDE he hears an AMUSED SNORT, then a LOW GROWL.  There's ONE HARD
     HIT and the door shivers.  THE DOORKNOB FALLS OFF!  It's over now.
     Pendergast kneels down, bracing the gun in both hands.  From this
     position he can see right through the hole where the doorknob fell.
     His mouth literally drops in astonishment as he sees... 

     a HUGE, red-rimmed, GREEN EYE!

     Involuntarily Pendergast LEAPS BACK, nearly falls and drops the gun!
     Beakers crash around him.  He scrambles in the darkness.  The flashlight
     falls and pops back on.  The beam streaks up crazily.  It's chaos.
     Pendergast is an easy target now.  He grabs for the light, the gun,
     steadies himself, breathing fast and low.  His heart pounds.  But
     nothing more happens.  The silence is heavy.  The eye is gone.  And
     suddenly Pendergast understands.

     In the distance he can hear HUMAN VOICES and a rolling wheelchair!
     Somewhere nearby are MARGO AND FROCK!  The monster has left him to get
     bigger game.  Fear for Margo and Frock lights Pendergast's eyes.  All
     panic and disorganization are gone.  He holds his revolver at 12
     o'clock and KICKS the door open, leaps out as

     A HUGE DARK SHAPE DARTS FROM THE ROOM.  It's headed for the secure
     storage areas again!  Pendergast takes off.  Not knowing how else to
     address this thing he finds himself calling... 

                              PENDERGAST
                    Halt!

     INT. SECURE STORAGE HALLWAY - BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Pendergast runs into the hallway but he's already too late.  The
     hulking shape of the quadruped is moving at incredible speed.

     ON PENDERGAST... as he levels his gun and shoots.

     THE CREATURE... stops, rears back on its haunches, looks once at
     Pendergast, pissed.  As the VOICES around the far corner fall silent,
     Pendergast FIRES.  The shot blasts off a piece of the wall.

     With astonishing speed and agility for its bulk, the beast turns and
     leaps around the corner, passing out of Pendergast's sight.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Margo!  Frock!  It's coming!  Run!

     AROUND THE CORNER... 

     Are MARGO AND FROCK... Frock holds the keys to secure storage area 1012
     in his hand.  Margo has the flashlight and the crate with the fibers.
     They can hear the sound of thundering movement.

                              FROCK
                    Look!

     Margo points her light in the distance and illuminates the beast!  It's
     descending like a freight train.  One split second of sheer amazement,
     then... 

                              MARGO
                    Dr. Frock!  Quick!

     Frock, immobilized in his wheel chair, stares at the monster, like a
     trapped rabbit looking at a descending hawk.  Margo grabs his keys from
     him, fumbles desperately to open the door.  It swings wide at last.  She
     grabs the handles of the wheelchair, tugs with all her might.  The
     wheels bump into the door frame but somehow she wrestles the damn
     thing inside.

     INT. SECURE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT

     Margo shoves Frock behind her, slams the door shut.  Seconds later, the
     beast throws itself against the storage door.  They hear it outside,
     growling in fury, claws lashing out.  Margo and Frock press back in the
     darkness, terror in their eyes.

     INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Pendergast runs forward in the echoing hallway, his gun drawn, his
     flashlight on.  A few more steps and he holds hard.  His eyes go wide in
     astonishment as his light illuminates the beast.  It's tearing at the
     steel door furiously with incredible force.

     As the flashlight beam hits it, MBWUN roars and looks up.  Now we see
     it clearly for the first time.  The monster is MASSIVE, putrid, rank.
     Slit reptilian green eyes are rimmed in red.  A ridge of stiff black
     hair rises on the creature's buffalo-like humped back.  The withers are
     muscled and covered with plates.  A forked TONGUE licks out as purple
     lips draw back exposing razor sharp teeth.  The claws raise up to fend
     off the light.

     PENDERGAST steadies himself with difficulty, takes a few seconds to
     aim with the greatest care.  Mbwun makes a move towards him and he
     squeezes the trigger hard.  The gun echoes in the hall.  A split second
     and a white streak moves right up the beast's cranium.  A direct hit.
     The shot echoes and Mbwun drops it's claws.

     The flashlight continues to shine like a high beam right into the
     beast's eyes.  Angry and blinded, the creature turns and in a moment,
     lopes off.  Pendergast watches, unimaginably relieved.  Realizing what
     just happened, his knees start to buckle.  He catches himself, wipes
     one hand across his eyes.  A voice comes from the storage room.

                              MARGO (OS)
                    Pendergast?  Are you all right?

                              PENDERGAST
                    No.  I think I'm hallucinating.

     The storage door opens slowly and Margo looks out.

                              MARGO
                    You're not.  Where is it?

                              PENDERGAST
                        (shakes his head)
                    Gone.

                              MARGO
                    Wounded?

                              PENDERGAST
                    No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45
                    caliber bullet bounced off that
                    thing's skull like a spit ball.  I
                    think it was bothered by my light.

                              MARGO
                    That would fit.  It's nocturnal.
                    Quick.  Come inside.

     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

     As hundreds of the guests emerge into the pounding rain... crying,
     terrified, unclear what exactly happened.  These are the lucky ones.
     Among them we find IPPOLITO.  His walkie talkie is squawking.  The
     windows of the museum behind him are black.

                              D'AGOSTA ON RADIO
                    Ippolito!  Where the hell are you?
                    We're trapped in here!  We need help!
                    Ippolito!  Come in, dammit!

     Ippolito sits down on the steps in the rain, knowing the extent of
     what he's done.  The wheels are working hard now, trying to figure out
     damage control.  The walkie talkie keeps calling.  He doesn't respond.

     INT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT

     Tables are overturned, food lies on the ground, people cower in the
     darkness.  D'Agosta crouches in some broken glass with his walkie
     talkie.  He shuts it off, rises, looks around.  Light comes from a few
     sputtering candles.

     Most of the guests still trapped inside are grouped around the lowered
     steel door.  Among them are KAWAKITA and CUTHBERT.  From the BODY of the
     man crushed underneath the door extends a large puddle of blood.
     Bailey is working in desperation on a brass panel by the door.

                              BAILEY
                    Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm
                    getting nothing, Lieutenant.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Great.

     Frank, the father of the teenage girl, Lauren, steps forward.

                              FRANK
                    There's no power.  The whole system's
                    down.

     The crowd starts to murmur.  One man yells.

                              MAN
                    We're trapped!  And there's a killer
                    in here!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    We'll get out safely if everyone
                    stays calm.  Is anyone else hurt?

     The MAYOR stands.  His wife's forehead is bleeding.

                              MAYOR
                    Yes.  My wife.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Is there a doctor?

     The distinguished grey haired man with a cane comes forward.  DR.
     POUND.

                              POUND
                    I'm Dr. Pound.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Check this woman and see if anyone
                    else needs you.

     Pound moves off.  Everyone spins now at the incongruous sound of a DOG
     BARK.  D'Agosta pulls his gun.  The door to a stairwell at the far end
     of the room opens and Hobbes bounds into the hall!  He's followed by
     Jonathan, who is filthy and wild-eyed.

                              JONATHAN
                        (calls)
                    Lieutenant D'Agosta!  Don't shoot.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Where's Pendergast?

                              JONATHAN
                        (crossing, breathless)
                    Five flights down.  We were lost in
                    the sub-basement.  Something's down
                    there.  It killed our two deputies.
                    When I left Pendergast it was coming
                    back.  He sent me for help.  We have
                    to hurry.

     D'Agosta makes a quick sweep of the room with his flashlight.  The
     remote corners of the hall are so black the light seems to disappear.
     In the center, two men are bending over a still form.  One of them is
     Dr. Pound.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Both of you.  Get back here.

                              POUND
                    But he's still alive --

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Get back now!

     The urgency in D'Agosta's voice gets everyone's attention.  The Mayor
     brings his wife over.  Cuthbert comes too.  They huddle apart from the
     others.  Cuthbert's white with fear.

                              CUTHBERT
                    What's going on?

     D'Agosta speaks low.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    There's some kind of animal loose in
                    the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He
                    needs help.  I want volunteers to go
                    with me.

                              BAILEY
                    I'm in.

                              KAWAKITA
                        (swallows)
                    Me too.

                              CUTHBERT
                        (voice rising in fear)
                    I'd do it gladly but someone needs
                    to stay with these people.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    All right.  You're elected.  Bailey,
                    get all the guns and flashlights,
                    give the mayor your walkie talkie so
                    we can keep in touch.  Cuthbert, keep
                    everyone together and make sure they
                    stay quiet.

     Frank steps forward.

                              FRANK
                    I was in the Marines.  Give me a gun.
                    I'd go with you, too, but I've got
                    my daughter.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What's your name?

                              FRANK
                    Frank.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    All right.  You guard these people
                    and your daughter.

     D'Agosta gives Frank his service revolver.

                              MAYOR'S WIFE
                        (to D'Agosta)
                    Where are you going?  Don't leave us
                    alone!

     The remaining crowd begins to whimper.  The Mayor rises.

                              MAYOR
                    Everyone quiet.  The Lieutenant's in
                    charge.

     Bailey and D'Agosta carry shot guns.  They quietly move to the back
     stairwell at the far end of the Hall of the Heavens.  Everyone else
     bunches together and watches.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Bailey, we'll go first and check the
                    stairwell.  Jonathan, you and Greg
                    guard the door.

     Jonathan gives Hobbes' leash to the Mayor.  D'Agosta hands Greg
     Kawakita a shotgun, tightens his grip on his own.  Then he gives the
     signal and Bailey yanks open the door to the stairwell.

     INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

     D'Agosta and Bailey go in slowly.  Jonathan stays in the doorway,
     sweeping the stairwell with his flashlight.  Kawakita gingerly holds
     his shotgun.  He's scared out of his mind.  He turns to Jonathan,
     whispers.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Excuse me.  Could you tell me how
                    this thing works?

                              JONATHAN
                    Oh Jesus.  Don't point it at me.  Just
                    aim and shoot.

     D'Agosta heads down the stairs in the lead, with Bailey close behind.
     The stairwell is windowless and dark.  D'Agosta shines his light and it
     cuts into the blackness.  He moves quietly, makes the first landing and
     stops.  Bailey watches his back from several steps behind as D'Agosta
     signals for him to wait.  The flashlight flares into a glass door one
     flight down.  D'Agosta raises his hand.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (low)
                    Hold on.  I thought I saw something.

     Everyone stops.  Bailey pumps his shotgun.  So does Jonathan.  Kawakita
     fumbles to do like the others.  They wait.  D'Agosta moves alone down
     several more steps.  The silence is heavy.  Suddenly D'Agosta wrinkles
     his nose.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Whoa... You smell that?

                              JONATHAN
                    Lieutenant!  Get back!

     Too late.  At this something DROPS FROM ABOVE!  A huge dark shape LEAPS
     INTO THE STAIRWELL, descending two floors!  It lands, pounces on BAILEY
     and the marble walls echo with a ROAR.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    BAILEY!!!

     Bailey SCREAMS in terror as Mbwun pins him down!

                              BAILEY
                    NOOOOO!

     CLOSE ON BAILEY... Three claws close on his neck and WRENCH HARD!
     There's a horrifying snap as Bailey's HEAD COMES OFF!  Blood SPURTS all
     over and drips down the stairs.

     D'AGOSTA levels his shotgun at the monster and fires, with no apparent
     effect.  When the shots stop echoing we hear SCREAMS and FRANTIC
     BARKING from the hall.

     MBWUN'S GREEN EYES look up and it's FORKED TONGUE LICKS OUT.  The
     monster LEAPS PAST Bailey's body and heads for the door!  D'Agosta,
     seeing what's happening, screams at the top of his lungs.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Jonathan!  Don't let it get into the
                    hall!

     ON JONATHAN... frozen in the doorway, Kawakita by his side.  Both of
     them are rigid with horror.  Disbelief in their eyes.  The BEAST leaps
     up directly at them as they jump to try and close the door.

     D'Agosta keeps firing until he's pumping an empty chamber.  Plaster is
     falling all around.  SCREAMS resound in the Hall of the Heavens as
     D'Agosta stumbles up the stairs.

     INT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT

     D'Agosta throws open the doors and charges into the Hall.  Jonathan
     lies on the ground, dazed.  Kawakita stands to one side, teeth
     chattering in shock.  His hand shakes so badly that the barrel of the
     gun swings in his hand.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (yells)
                    Where is it?!

                              JONATHAN
                    I don't know!  It hit me hard.

     D'Agosta pumps two shells in the shotgun.  Screams can be heard from
     the people crouched together at the edge of the room.  Hobbes is
     barking wildly, foaming at the mouth.  It's too dark to see what's
     happening.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (screams)
                    Somebody tell me!  Where is it now?

                              MAYOR
                        (quiet)
                    Lieutenant.  In the south corner.

     D'Agosta sweeps his light to the Mayor who stands rigid in front of
     the others, points to his left.  The light moves to the far end of the
     room where THE DARK SHAPE OF MBWUN crouches over the body of a man.
     It's lunging up and down with odd, jerking motions.  The man is long
     past making a sound.  From the monster comes a faint crunching and
     slobbering.  Jonathan rises, comes to D'Agosta.  So does Frank.  They
     stand shoulder to shoulder, raise their guns.  D'Agosta motions for
     Kawakita.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    On three.

     Kawakita stumbles to join them, tries to join in.  The barrel of his
     shot gun still swings wildly.  He steadies it by taking it in both
     hands.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    One, two... three.

     All three fire.  There's a loud report.  The kickback knocks Kawakita
     backwards.  Screams erupt from the huddled group.  Hobbes abruptly shuts
     up.  The men fire and fire until there's nothing left.  D'Agosta reaches
     for more shells, comes up empty.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Jonathan!  Get everyone behind me!

     Jonathan moves.  D'Agosta sweeps his light across the room but already
     the shape is gone.  Cuthbert hides behind the Mayor, calls out in a
     terrified squeal.

                              CUTHBERT
                    It went out the door to the rotunda!

     D'Agosta runs across the room to a set of double industrial doors.
     There's a noise in the darkness beyond and he just manages to slam
     both doors.  He picks up a metal chair and jams it through the handles.
     Backs up.  The doors shudder as something hits them hard.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Get everyone into the stairwell!

     Jonathan, the Mayor, Cuthbert and Kawakita together herd everyone
     towards the stairwell.  They move inside.

     INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

     Dark and close.  The smell of gunpowder and death.  The Mayor's Wife
     sees Bailey's body and clutches her mouth so as not to throw up.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Sweet Jesus!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Get his gun and his walkie talkie,
                    Jonathan.  Move.

                              CUTHBERT
                    My office is on the third floor!
                    There's a walk-in safe and a
                    portable phone!  We can lock
                    ourselves in the safe and call for
                    help!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita
                    and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest
                    of you can go with Cuthbert!

                              MAYOR
                    I think we should stick together!

                              FRANK
                        (taking Bailey's shotgun)
                    Me too.

                              CUTHBERT
                    I'm leaving.  Whoever wants can come
                    with me.

     No one follows.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Wait!

     Cuthbert's gone.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Jonathan, go with him!  He isn't
                    armed.

     Jonathan grabs Hobbes' leash from the Mayor and bounds up the stairs.

                              MAYOR
                    Good luck!

     Everyone else follows D'Agosta.  Together, they head down.

     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

     Police cars are pulling up outside the museum.  Sirens wail.  Torrents
     of rain limit the number of onlookers.  Crowds of people are scattered
     about.  There's disbelief on everyone's faces.  Many people are in
     shock.  Ippolito sprints through the pelting rain to a GUARD STATION
     near the gate.  He yanks the door open and jumps inside.

     INT. GUARD STATION - NIGHT

     A number of museum security personnel are milling in confusion.

                              IPPOLITO
                    All right everyone.  I'm in charge.
                    Status report.

     One of the security men, WATERS, rises.

                              WATERS
                    Swat teams are on the way.  Fire
                    trucks with them.  Everything's
                    slowed down because of the rain.
                    We're bringing in portable
                    generators.  They'll get the
                    emergency lights working but they
                    won't pump enough power to lift the
                    doors.

     Ippolito pulls out his walkie talkie.

                              IPPOLITO
                    D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.

                              D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)
                        (a string of curses followed by...)
                    Where the hell are you?

                              IPPOLITO
                    I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate
                    the rescue efforts from here.  Help
                    is on the way.  Just sit tight.

                              D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)
                    It's a little late, you son of a
                    bitch.  There's a friggin' monster
                    loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire
                    department.  Find metal cutters, cut
                    through.  And bring a cannon.  The
                    damn thing is huge.

     A long moment as the men look at each other.

                              WATERS
                    Did he say monster?

                              IPPOLITO
                    Panic attack.

     INT. MUSEUM STAIRWELL - NIGHT

     D'Agosta's group has reached a lower floor.  Here this stairwell ends.
     Ahead stretches the hall of the Asian peoples.

                              IPPOLITO (OS)
                    D'Agosta, put on the Mayor.

     D'Agosta passes the walkie talkie to the Mayor.

                              MAYOR
                    Mayor Jordan here.

                              IPPOLITO (ON RADIO)
                    This is Ippolito, head of museum
                    security.  Relieve D'Agosta and take
                    command.

                              MAYOR
                    Don't tell me what to do you chicken
                    shit bastard.  I saw you cut and run!
                    Lieutenant D'Agosta stayed with us.
                    He is in charge.  There is a monster.
                    I saw it.  Cut through those doors
                    and get us out of here, now!

     The Mayor shuts off the walkie talkie and they round another corner
     and disappear from sight.

     INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

     Ippolito finds Waters and the others staring at him.  Humiliated, he
     swallows hard.

                              IPPOLITO
                    All right.  The steel doors are
                    designed to retard cutting.  We can
                    go through them, but it would take
                    hours.

                              WATERS
                    The quickest way in would be to go
                    through the roof, sir.  Cell two goes
                    up to the fifth floor.  There are sky
                    lights up there.

                              IPPOLITO
                    Co-ordinate with the fire department
                    and SWAT teams.  Move.

     INT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT

     It's very dark.  The huge shape of MBWUN can barely be seen sliding out
     of the stairwell and into the Hall of the Asian Peoples.  Then DIM RED
     HALL LIGHTS come on in the corners of the ceiling.  The monster utters
     a low growl.  The emergency generators are beginning to come on.  The
     animal lopes to the spot where we last saw D'Agosta and his group,
     sniffs the ground.  It looks up and, with a curiously human gesture,
     cocks its massive head.

     The silence is broken by VOICES!  They're in the distance and muffled,
     but definitely there.  The monster crouches eagerly, lopes forward with
     great stealth.  The voices are getting louder.  We follow as it goes
     through the hall and down... 

     A STAIRWELL... At the bottom, Mbwun quickly turns a corner... The voices
     have stopped.  Mbwun creeps forward, enters... 

     INT. HALL OF MARINE ANIMALS - NIGHT

     A huge room several stories high.  A WHALE hangs suspended from the
     ceiling.  Dioramas of fish line all the walls.  Mbwun pauses next to a
     diorama of the gentle, vegetarian sea cow, THE MANATEE.  The two make a
     startling contrast.

     A pause and then the voices are heard again, much louder now.  The
     source is right around the edge of the Manatee display.  Mbwun LEAPS
     FORWARD, claws lashing out.  He turns the corner and crashes through a
     wall of GLASS as he grabs at the source of the voices... 

     A display of small, extraordinarily life-like TALKING HOLOGRAMS!
     They've been re-activated with the emergency power system.  Each little
     talking figure is no more then five inches high.  They move around a
     small three dimensional display of marine animals, explaining the lung
     systems of fish.

     MBWUN... stands in the pile of broken glass, stares at the holograms,
     mesmerized.  He makes a noise that sounds astonishingly like a CHUCKLE!
     Then he reaches out one long claw and tries unsuccessfully to touch
     one of the holograms.  But the shadowy creatures can't be caught.  The
     beast seems to realize this, SNORTS and moves off.  As he goes he
     passes behind a

     LARGE GLASS ELEVATOR.  It stands in middle the open room.  The elevator
     is designed to carry people upstairs and down in the two story
     exhibit.  In the dim light, with his poor vision, the monster doesn't
     see D'Agosta, the Mayor, Kawakita, and their entire group SANDWICHED
     INSIDE.  The monster exits the exhibit and quietly D'Agosta slides the
     doors open.  Everyone, all thirty-five people in evening clothes,
     quickly get out and run across the exhibit to another stairwell at the
     far side of the hall.

     INT. SECURE STORAGE AREA 1012 - NIGHT

     Margo, Frock and Pendergast wait in the darkness.  Pendergast, for the
     first time, seems fazed.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I don't know how to deal with this.
                    It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever
                    saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a
                    monster, a supernatural creature
                    like that.

                              MARGO
                    It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an
                    animal.  Part lizard, part human, a
                    genetic freak of some kind, like the
                    half-goat, half-sheep they found
                    last year in the jungles of Vietnam.

                              PENDERGAST
                    But this isn't the jungle!  This is
                    New York.  How did it get here?  A
                    thing like that crossed two
                    continents.  It makes no sense!

                              FROCK
                        (lame)
                    We think it may have something to do
                    with the eggs we found in the crate.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I don't believe it.

                              MARGO
                    None of that matters now.  The people
                    upstairs need us.  We have to help.

                              FROCK
                    We can't.  We've managed to get
                    inside the one place that's safe.  I
                    think we should sit tight and wait
                    for reinforcements.  If we go
                    outside, we're risking more lives.
                    You have to accept it, Margo,
                    there's nothing we can do.  The
                    building must be swarming with
                    police by now.  It won't take long
                    for them to get through the doors.

                              MARGO
                    That thing could kill ten people in
                    a matter of minutes.

                              PENDERGAST
                    But what can we do?  Our guns are
                    useless --

                              MARGO
                    We have the fibers.  Don't you see?
                    The creature is hungry.  It wants the
                    hormones in these plants.  It would
                    take hundreds of human brains to
                    supply what's in these fibers.  We're
                    just a poor substitute.  To make it
                    stop hunting, we have to give it
                    what it wants.

     INT. CUTHBERT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Cuthbert enters with Jonathan and the dog, Hobbes.  Cuthbert locks the
     door with shaking hands.  He mutters to himself in terror.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Solid oak.  Two inches thick.  Tell me
                    they'll hold.

     Cuthbert scurries to his desk and pulls out a Ruger .38 Magnum.

                              CUTHBERT
                    I got it after I was mugged in the
                    subway last spring.

                              JONATHAN
                    Where's the walk-in safe?

                              CUTHBERT
                    Behind you.

                              JONATHAN
                    What's the combination?

                              CUTHBERT
                    I'll do it.  Just let me find my
                    portable phone.

     He rummages in the darkness, going through his desk.

                              JONATHAN
                    Forget it!

                              CUTHBERT
                    Calm down.  I found it!

     Cuthbert flips the phone open and turns it on.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Battery's dead.  Shit.

                              JONATHAN
                    Let's go!

     Cuthbert crosses to a huge wall safe, starts frantically turning the
     tumblers.  Jonathan follows with the dog.

                              CUTHBERT
                    That thing won't come after us,
                    right?  It's going for bigger game.
                    The group blundering around in the
                    basement.  Poor fools.

                              JONATHAN
                    Hurry up!

                              CUTHBERT
                    Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the
                    gun.

     Cuthbert fumbles to hand over the Ruger.  As he does, something drops.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Oh God!  I dropped my rabbit's foot!

     Cuthbert drops to his knees, groping in the darkness.

                              JONATHAN
                    For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's
                    the combination?!

                              CUTHBERT
                    To the left twice then five no... 
                    sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's
                    been a while... 

                              JONATHAN
                    Oh Jesus... 

     Jonathan starts again, sweating.  The tumblers fall with agonizing
     slowness.  Cuthbert continues groping frantically for his good luck
     charm.  Meanwhile, unnoticed by Jonathan, the dog is staring at the oak
     doors.  We see the HAIR ON HIS BACK rise!

                              JONATHAN
                    Fifteen... what's next?

                              CUTHBERT
                    Eight to the right!  Look!  I found
                    it!

     Clutching the rabbit's foot like a talisman, Cuthbert leaps up just as
     the last tumbler falls.

     At this the oak doors behind them CRASH OPEN, splintering like so many
     match sticks.

     Cuthbert SCREAMS in a high pitch whine at the sight of the beast.  The
     dog barks wildly at Mbwun!  Jonathan lifts his shot gun.  But the
     monster barrels past him and zeros in on Cuthbert!

     A HUGE RED TONGUE LICKS OUT and encircles Cuthbert's waist!  It
     squeezes him horribly, drags him towards the open jaws!  Cuthbert
     bellows like a lamb being led to the slaughter.  He opens his hand and
     the rabbit's foot drops!  The last Jonathan sees of Cuthbert is his
     head disappearing down Mbwun's throat.

     Hobbes barks and whines in terror.  Jonathan takes the leash and drags
     the animal out.

     INT. MUSEUM HALLWAYS - NIGHT

     Jonathan and Hobbes tear down the hallway and disappear.  Behind them
     comes a roar so loud it rattles the walls.

     INT. HALLWAYS - SECURE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT

     The door opens slowly and Pendergast appears.  He shines his beam in
     both directions.

                              PENDERGAST
                    All clear.

     Margo and Frock quickly come out.  Margo holds the crate.  Frock tries
     to follow in his wheelchair.

                              FROCK
                    I'm coming with you.

                              MARGO
                    No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.

                              PENDERGAST
                    You'd slow us down and put Margo in
                    danger.

                              MARGO
                    Unlock one of the other storage
                    rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll
                    leave a trail back to 1012 and try
                    to trap the monster in here.

                              FROCK
                    Margo, this is too dangerous.  You
                    always think you can solve
                    everything.  This time you don't have
                    enough information.  The animal might
                    behave in unexpected ways.
                        (to Pendergast)
                    Leave her here with me.  Don't put
                    her in danger.

                              PENDERGAST
                    He's right.

                              MARGO
                    No.  You'll need me --

     At this a LOUD SOUND comes from upstairs!

                              FROCK
                    What's that?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Footsteps!

                              MARGO
                    No, not footsteps!  People running
                    for their lives!

     All three know this ends the discussion.  Frock opens the door to room
     1010.  Inside are shelves of priceless ivory tusks.  Margo takes
     Pendergast's handkerchief and wraps her hand.  She quickly sprinkles
     some of the fibers inside the door to room 1012.  Before Dr. Frock
     disappears into room 1010, he looks back to Margo one last time.

                              FROCK
                    Come back and get me.

                              MARGO
                    We will.

                              FROCK
                    Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It
                    hunts with its sense of smell.  So
                    for God's sake, Margo, don't get
                    those fibers on your clothes!

     INT. OSTEO PREP - NIGHT

     Margo and Pendergast emerge from the hall to the storage rooms and run
     for the far stairs.  From somewhere above the sound of running is
     louder now.

     INT. PLANETARIUM - NIGHT

     D'Agosta and his group enter the large domed space in disarray.
     They're spread out and panicked, the young helping the old.  Dr. Pound
     is finding it hard to keep up.  Frank and his daughter Lauren bring him
     along.  The Mayor quietly urges people forward.  His wife's face is
     streaked with tears.  Kawakita runs with D'Agosta.

                              KAWAKITA
                    It's still back there!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I know.

     Now a voice is heard in the distance.

                              PENDERGAST (OS)
                    Where are you?  Who's there?

     Everyone stops.  D'Agosta shines his light into the large space.  Above
     them constellations glow.  D'Agosta calls out... 

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Pendergast!

     INT. HALL OF NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT

     Margo and Pendergast run.  Margo carries the crate carefully wrapped in
     Pendergast's jacket.

                              PENDERGAST
                    That was D'Agosta.

                              MARGO
                    The planetarium!

                              PENDERGAST
                        (calls out)
                    Vince!

                              D'AGOSTA (OS)
                    Over here!

     There's a double steel fire door at the end of the hallway.  Pendergast
     and Margo run for it.  Pendergast shoves at the door.  It won't budge.
     There's a small glass window.  In it, D'Agosta's face appears.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (through the window)
                    Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind
                    us!

                              PENDERGAST
                    This door's locked.  Try shooting the
                    hinges off.

     INT. PLANETARIUM - NIGHT

     D'Agosta turns to his group.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Step back!

     D'Agosta, Frank and Kawakita aim their guns at the door and shoot
     repeatedly.  The shots echo wildly.  The sound is terrifyingly loud.  The
     small glass window shatters.  Then the men lean heavily on the door.  It
     still won't budge.  D'Agosta looks through the window.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    It's no use.  We have to get out of
                    here!
                        (to Kawakita)
                    Give them your walkie talkie.

     Kawakita hands his walkie talkie through the window.  Margo takes it.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Is Dr. Frock safe!

                              MARGO
                    Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of
                    yourself!

     INT. HALL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT

     Pendergast looks desperately at the blueprints.

                              MARGO
                    Is there another way around?

                              PENDERGAST
                    No.  The planetarium is in the next
                    cell.  This is one of the fire
                    doors... 

     Pendergast returns to the window.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Vince?  There's no way we can get to
                    you with the fire doors down.
                    There's an entrance to the sub-
                    basement in the hall off the north
                    side exit.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    The sub-basement?

                              PENDERGAST
                    I've been down there.  It links up to
                    the old sewer system.  I can guide
                    you out.

     D'Agosta turns to the others.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    How much ammo do we have to make a
                    stand?

                              KAWAKITA
                    You're asking me?  I don't even know
                    how to load this thing.

                              FRANK
                    Four rounds... 

     There's a movement of air... and a ripe, fetid smell.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Oh shit.

     D'Agosta pumps his shot gun.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I smell it.  It's here.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Go out the north exit!  There's a
                    hallway and a false wall by the
                    Greek vases.  Run!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Everybody.  Get behind me.

     The others move past.  D'Agosta, Frank and Greg Kawakita hold the rear.
     The group runs to the side exit to the planetarium and in a moment,
     disappears.

     INT. HALL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT

     Pendergast remains at the window watching anxiously.  From the south
     entrance to the planetarium, an ENORMOUS DARK SHAPE slinks into view!
     Pendergast steps back from the doorway, turns to Margo.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Hide quickly!

                              MARGO
                    What are you going to do?

     Pendergast checks his gun, totally calm.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Buy them some time.

     Margo turns and looks around at the looming dioramas.  There's a plain
     door at their end of the hall.  Pendergast faces the broken window.

     HIS POV... the beast is slinking away after D'Agosta and the others,
     headed to the north exit from the Planetarium!

     PENDERGAST calls out... 

                              PENDERGAST
                    Hey you big tub of lard!  Over here!

     THE BEAST PAUSES, turns.

     Pendergast puts his palms up at his ears, wiggles his fingers and
     makes a face through the window.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Come on, you smelly pile of refuse.
                    Come get me.  I dare you!

     A LOW surprised GROWL comes from the beast.  It crouches as if to
     pounce.  Pendergast makes more faces, sticks his tongue out.  The beast
     watches in silence, its evil eyes fixed.

     ON MARGO... watching Pendergast.  She can't leave him yet.

                              MARGO
                    What is it doing?

                              PENDERGAST
                        (loud)
                    It's scared of me.

     Suddenly there's a CRASH and the door BENDS like cardboard.  TWO HUGE
     SETS OF CLAWS lash through!  Margo screams as the claws pass inches
     from Pendergast's face.  He leaps back, lifts his gun which looks like
     a pea shooter in the face of Mbwun.

     Two sets of claws curve around the bent edges of the door, then Mbwun
     simply LIFTS it out of the frame.  This leaves Pendergast face to face
     with the foul, enormous monster!  It regards him evenly, blinks once.
     Then the tongue slides out, licks its lips eagerly and... 

     Pendergast FLICKS on his high powered FLASHLIGHT, shining it at close
     range right in the beast's eyes!  Then carefully, with total calm he
     FIRES ONCE, TWICE.  The beast howls more in anger than pain, REARS UP
     and swipes at Pendergast.  Pendergast dives to one side and, the claws
     miss again by inches as the beast is temporarily blinded by the light.
     Now Pendergast spins and runs for all he's worth.  Margo's been
     waiting, holding the door.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Drop the fibers!

     She leaves the crate behind as Pendergast dives inside with her.  Margo
     shoves the door shut hard as Mbwun, still blinded, leaps into the
     hall.  But now, suddenly, all is quiet.  No sign of Margo and
     Pendergast.  The beast moves forward, snuffling slowly.  It starts for
     the door which hides Margo and Pendergast, but stops as it finds... 

     THE CRATE!  The beast moves to it, clearly surprised.  It pokes at the
     crate carefully, inhales the fragrance and grunts.  The monster seems
     to be struggling with itself!  It sniffs the fibers, lifts a few out
     carefully, then SHOVES THE CRATE AWAY HARD.  Then it rises on its
     haunches and squints into the dark.

     On all sides are glowing displays of stuffed buffalo, gazelle, wild
     horses, wolves, giant elk, sabre tooth tigers.  Mbwun moves close to
     one after another.  Suddenly we notice, in the back of one of the
     dioramas... 

     Margo and Pendergast!  They stand frozen, crouching behind mannequins
     of native Americans riding horses across the plains.  The beast sniffs
     RIGHT AT THEIR WINDOW, then turns away.  Confused, it heads back
     towards the Planetarium and slinks from the room.

     INSIDE THE DIORAMA... Pendergast and Margo exchange an astonished look.
     They whisper.

                              PENDERGAST
                    What happened?

                              MARGO
                    Its eyesight is worse than I
                    thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it
                    couldn't smell us through the glass.

                              PENDERGAST
                    It didn't want the fibers.  What does
                    that mean?

                              MARGO
                    I think... it means it's full.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Then it won't go after the others?

                              MARGO
                    No.  It's still hunting, but not for
                    the hormones.

                              PENDERGAST
                    For what?

                              MARGO
                    I think... for the pleasure of the
                    kill.

     INT. HALLWAY - MUSEUM - NIGHT

     Greg, the Mayor, D'Agosta and the others are in a hallway lined with
     at least a dozen vases.  A GREEK VASE has been shoved aside revealing
     the outlines of a door.  Behind is a sloping dark corridor.  The last of
     the thirty-five people pack in.  Greg and D'Agosta cover the corridor.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    That's it, let's go!

     Grim-faced, D'Agosta follows Kawakita as they duck through the
     doorway, shutting it behind them.  The impact rattles the wall and the
     Greek vase falls.

     INT. SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Kawakita and D'Agosta reach the bottom and turn to see the Mayor, his
     wife, Dr. Pound and their whole group standing in several feet of
     rushing water.  Lauren is shivering.  Her father has his arm around her
     tight.  Behind them are two corridors, one forking left and the other
     straight.  D'Agosta gets out the walkie talkie, clicks it on.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (into walkie talkie)
                    Pendergast.  We made it.  You all
                    right?

     INT. DIORAMA - NIGHT

     Pendergast has the plans open as he studies them.  He speaks into the
     walkie talkie.  Margo paces behind him, thinking hard.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We're fine.  Take the left fork
                    behind you.  You'll be in a straight
                    passage.  When the hall forks again
                    in fifty yards go right.  Then radio
                    back.

     INT. SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

     D'Agosta shuts off his walkie talkie.  Everyone's staring at him.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Oh shit.

                              FRANK
                    No, Lieutenant.  He's not a good
                    enough shot.  I'll do it if you take
                    care of my daughter.

     D'Agosta nods.  Frank expertly reloads.  D'Agosta holsters the walkie
     talkie and they plunge down the left hand passage.  Kawakita takes
     charge of Lauren, who is confused and terrified.  The tunnel has a
     slight downhill grade, and the water begins to move faster, tugging at
     everyone's legs.  People slip and slide as they half make their way
     down the hill.  D'Agosta calls behind them.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Damn.  It's getting deep.  See
                    anything?

     ON FRANK... back not far from the first fork.  He looks towards the head
     of the tunnel, calls out... 

                              FRANK
                    You'll be the first to know.

     Frank turns and plunges after the others.  But then suddenly, he stops.

     ON D'AGOSTA... he reaches the second fork and takes a right.  This
     tunnel is narrower and consequently the water is even deeper.  Slimy
     plants hang down and slap at their faces as they push on.  D'Agosta
     pulls out his walkie talkie.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Pendergast?  I made the right hand
                    fork.  We're already in about three
                    feet of water.  Where should we go?

     But before Pendergast can answer, D'Agosta hears the loud report of
     Frank's gun!  Everyone freezes in the darkness.  The walkie talkie
     cackles and D'Agosta shouts!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Hello!

                              FRANK (OS)
                    Sweet Jesus, help!

     They hear SPLASHING in the water.  Lauren SCREAMS, tries to run back.
     Kawakita grabs her.  There's more thrashing water and then silence.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Frank!  Are you all right!

     D'Agosta starts for Frank but the Mayor catches his arm and holds him.

                              MAYOR
                    It's too late!

     Everyone waits, staring into the darkness.  Still no answer.  Lauren
     SCREAMS AGAIN.

                              LAUREN
                    Dad!

     D'Agosta turns his flashlight on the water.  It's running red!  He spins
     to the Mayor, points down the tunnel.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Run!

     People start to cry and whimper as the Mayor urges them on.  He takes
     charge of Lauren.  Only Greg Kawakita stays with D'Agosta.  They stand
     shoulder to shoulder and completely alone.  Thrashing in the water can
     be heard as the beast comes closer.  There's a low, pleasurable growl!
     Both men lift their guns.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    On three.

     Kawakita nods.  Behind them in the tunnel is total blackness.  Ahead is
     equally dark.  The noise of their friends gets ever fainter.  The water
     now rushes half way up their thighs.  Kawakita's teeth start to
     chatter.  He bites them shut, steadies his gun.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    One... two... 

     Silence as the water murmurs.  D'Agosta holds the count.  A long,
     agonizing moment.  Kawakita takes his eyes away from the tunnel.

                              KAWAKITA
                    I think it's gone.

     Suddenly a HUGE CLAW snakes out of the water right in front of them
     and the beast roars up!  It was beneath the surface, directly before
     them!  The claw closes on D'Agosta and his shot gun goes off.  D'Agosta
     screams as the beast lifts him towards its mouth!

     For one horrible moment, Kawakita is frozen.  Then he leaps forward,
     shoves the barrel of his gun behind D'Agosta, right in the beast's
     open jaws!  He pulls the trigger and the shotgun explodes, the recoil
     throwing him back, ass over tea cups in the water.  With a roar of pain
     the monster drops D'Agosta and retreats in the dark.  D'Agosta grabs
     Kawakita.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I think you took its tonsils out!

     They haul ass down the tunnel, firing behind them as they go.  Ahead is
     another fork.  The group is waiting.  When they see D'Agosta and
     Kawakita, a cheer goes up.

                              MAYOR
                    Which way!

     As he runs up, D'Agosta grabs for his walkie talkie.  The holster IS
     EMPTY, the walkie talkie gone!  Without missing a beat he registers
     what's happened, then covers it up with the next breath.  He points to
     the right as if there's no doubt and says... 

                              D'AGOSTA
                    This way!

     D'Agosta exchanges a look with Kawakita, who understands exactly what
     happened.  As they plunge into the right tunnel, Greg mutters... 

                              KAWAKITA
                    Holy shit.

     INT. HALL OF THE AFRICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT

     Pendergast and Margo come out of the door leading to the back entry to
     the dioramas.  Pendergast holds the walkie talkie, desperate.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Vince?  Can you hear me?  Vince!

     Nothing but static comes in response.  Margo paces in agitation.

                              MARGO
                    We have to try and draw it off!

                              PENDERGAST
                    How?

                              MARGO
                    The answer's right in front of us.

     She points to one of the dioramas.  It shows a bird being stalked by a
     fox.

                              MARGO
                    That's a ptarmigan, feigning a
                    broken wing.  The bird pretends to be
                    injured to draw the fox away from
                    its nest!

                              PENDERGAST
                        (starts running)
                    It's deceptively simple.  Like a
                    Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.

     Margo heads for the Planetarium, calling... 

                              MARGO
                    Help!  Please someone!  Help!

     They disappear down the hall with the Greek vases, both calling with
     all they've got.

     EXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT

     There are increasing numbers of SWAT vehicles around.  A HELICOPTER
     lands on the roof.  The rescue effort continues to be slowed by rain
     pouring down.  Ippolito is in the thick of the action.  The S.W.A.T.
     commander, JENNINGS, comes over buckling an ammo belt over his
     fatigues.

                              JENNINGS
                    We're ready.  We've got enough
                    firepower to turn a herd of lions
                    into a fine red mist.

                              IPPOLITO
                    Then do it.

     Jennings nods, goes off.  As Ippolito watches the S.W.A.T. team break
     the glass skylights, gets ready to go in.

     INT. HALL OF THE REPTILES - NIGHT

     Jonathan crouches in the staircase at the end of the Hall of the
     Reptiles.  Hobbes is still by his side.  He keeps the gun pointed out
     into the room, his eyes scanning the dark.  He whispers to Hobbes, as
     if to comfort both of them.

                              JONATHAN
                    It's okay, Hobbes.  We'll be all
                    right.  Help has got to come
                    eventually... We'll make it.  We'll be
                    fine.

     Suddenly he sees something.  What appears to be a BODY lying on a glass
     case!  Jonathan pumps his gun, approaches slowly.  The man wears a
     tuxedo, is lying very still.  As we get closer we see it's THE DRUNK
     Kawakita ran into in the stairwell so long ago!  He suddenly HICCUPS.
     Jonathan starts.  Now the man gently snores.  Jonathan moves to him,
     shakes the drunk's shoulder.

                              JONATHAN
                    Hey!  Wake up!

     The man snorts, opens his eyes and frowns.

                              DRUNK
                    Who the hell are you?

                              JONATHAN
                    You first.

     Jonathan helps the drunk off the glass case.  The man's a little
     unsteady as he tugs at his tux.

                              DRUNK
                    I got lost tryin' to find the
                    bathroom.  I was walkin' in circles.
                    I lay down for a nap.  What's going
                    on?

                              JONATHAN
                    You wouldn't believe me if I told
                    you.

     Hobbes has started to wag his tail and tug at the leash to draw
     Jonathan's attention.

                              JONATHAN
                    What is it, boy?

     From above comes the beating of a distant HELICOPTER and then the
     sound of breaking glass.  Hobbes pulls Jonathan back to the staircase.
     Jonathan grins, follows behind with the drunk.

                              DRUNK
                    Where we going?

                              JONATHAN
                    I think we're going home.

     INT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT

     Huge skeletons of Tyrannosaurus, Stegosaurus and Brontosaurus loom in
     the darkness.  Rain is pouring in.  Jonathan, Hobbes and the drunk
     enter, looks up to the sky lights.  A FLASH OF LIGHTING hits,
     illuminating the dinosaurs and a S.W.A.T. team which is descending on
     a series of ropes.  It's a sixty foot drop.  Jonathan steps forward.

                              JONATHAN
                    Hello!  We're over here!

     They run across the long hall and wait as the the men descend.  The
     first one down is Jennings.

                              JENNINGS
                    Are you hurt?

                              JONATHAN
                    We're fine.  I don't know about the
                    people downstairs.  In the Hall of
                    the Heavens.  The basement... you'll
                    need help.  There's a monster down
                    there.

     A sling suspended on ropes is lowered down.

                              JENNINGS
                    The rescue workers will lift you out
                    one at a time.

     Jennings signals to a group of five men, heavily armed and in flack
     jackets.  They prepare to get the drunk out.

     INT. HALL WITH GREEK VASES - NIGHT

     Pendergast and Margo are at the top of the long, narrow shaft.
     Pendergast's flashlight sends a circle of light onto a sheet of black,
     oily water below.  Both of them continue calling, trying to draw off
     the monster.

                              MARGO
                    Help someone!

                              PENDERGAST
                    Oh God!  Help!

     They suddenly hear the sound of splashing.  An updraft rustles their
     clothes.  Margo sniffs the air, turns to Pendergast.

                              MARGO
                    You smell that?

                              PENDERGAST
                    It's coming.  Run.

     INT. SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

     The group has reached another intersection of tunnels.  The left fork
     turns back uphill.  D'Agosta indicates this tunnel.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    At least we'll be dry.

     They all press forward in the low vaulted darkness.  As they move
     steadily upwards the water recedes.  Kawakita's flashlight flickers and
     he bangs it.  It comes on again.

                              KAWAKITA
                    I believe in you a hundred percent,
                    Vince, but that's the second time
                    we've been at that intersection.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Not so loud.

     D'Agosta shines his light forward and they see that the shaft ends in
     a large round PIPE.

                              KAWAKITA
                    What's that?

                              D'AGOSTA
                    All right everybody, hold up!

     Kawakita and D'Agosta move past the shivering people who are strung
     out along the sides of the tunnel.  D'Agosta touches each person as he
     passes.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    We don't know what's in there.  Let
                    me go first.

     INT. PIPE - NIGHT

     The Mayor follows behind with the group as Kawakita and D'Agosta lead
     the way.  The pipe is dry and rusted.  They move forward with stealth.
     In twenty feet the pipe ends abruptly in darkness.  D'Agosta steps out
     first.

     INT. CAVERN - NIGHT

     The group huddles at the mouth of the pipe, confused, as D'Agosta pans
     his flashlight around the huge space.  The walls are carved out of dirt
     and rounded like a cave.  From the ceiling hang huge cobwebs.  There's a
     large pile of sticks in one corner fashioned rather like a bed.  On a
     mound of dirt beside this bed rests a battered duffel bag.

     Greg moves to it, shines his light on the side.  A name is written in
     marker.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What does it say?

                              KAWAKITA
                        (looks up, shocked)
                    Dr. John Whittlesley.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What's that doing here?

                              KAWAKITA
                    I don't know.  I thought Dr.
                    Whittlesley died in South America.

                              MAYOR
                        (interrupts)
                    Look.  There's a ladder at the end.  I
                    think it goes up to the street!

     They move forward into the darkness eagerly, towards the ladder which
     leads up to a manhole.  But as they pass the bed of twigs, something
     loud CRUNCHES underfoot.

                              KAWAKITA
                    What is that?

     D'Agosta shines his light down and everyone freezes.  Then one woman
     SCREAMS!

     The wide dirt floor around them is carpeted in clean white BONES!  The
     HUMMING noise is louder and we see its source.  Atop the bones is the
     body of CUTHBERT!  It's covered with BLACK DERMESTID BEETLES.  They're
     stripping the skeleton clean, devouring the flesh!

     The group panics and breaks for the ladder.  Kawakita and D'Agosta once
     more guard the rear.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I'd say we're in its home.

     INT. HALL OF THE NORTHWEST COAST INDIANS - NIGHT

     Pendergast and Margo run down the long dark room, passing an enormous
     hollowed-out canoe.  As they exit the far end, the dark shape of Mbwun
     emerges.  It leaps forward, closing in fast.

     INT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT

     Margo and Pendergast enter a series of maze-like room with hidden
     corners, nooks and crannies with cases full of esoteric Buddhist and
     Japanese Art.  They're running through the twists and turns as fast as
     they can.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We're not going to make the storage
                    room!

                              MARGO
                    Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's
                    DNA is part homo sapien.  In
                    primates, the eye is a direct path
                    to the brain!  If you get a clean
                    shot, there's only one place you can
                    kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!

     AT THIS THEY ROUND A CORNER AND MBWUN LEAPS OUT!  It circled ahead and
     was waiting in front of them!  The animal swipes at Margo and
     Pendergast.  The force of the monster's blow sends Margo reeling and
     slams Pendergast into the wall.  He falls, crumples and drops his gun!
     The case beside him SHATTERS spewing relics, as Mbwun pushes past.
     Pendergast groans and gets to his knees with difficulty.

     MARGO is frantically crawling away in the dark!  The beast makes a low
     sound of pleasure and reaches out one claw, easily pins her down.
     Pendergast looks frantically for any kind of weapon!

     ON MARGO now PINNED BENEATH the heaving body of the monster!
     Powerless, she looks up into the horrible face of death as Mbwun
     raises an enormous claw!  Pendergast, desperate, cries out --

                              PENDERGAST
                    Please, no!  Don't hurt Margo!

     Oddly enough, the beast pauses for once.  Talking to the damn thing is
     the one tactic no one has tried!  The claw halts in mid-air.  The beast
     blinks once and looks from Pendergast to Margo.  Margo sees a flash of
     something unexpectedly HUMANin its eyes!  In astonishment, she
     whispers... 

                              MARGO
                    My God.  You understand.

     As they stare, amazed, imperceptibly, the beast appears to narrow its
     eyes in response!  Margo controls her voice, keeps it even.

                              MARGO
                    Please let me go.  We won't hurt you.

     A strange noise comes out of the monster.  A low, confused growl.  He
     doesn't loosen his grip on Margo, but he leans down to look at her
     closer with one green, unblinking eye.

     She struggles not to turn away in revulsion.  His enormous jaws are
     right near her throat.  Everything is very still.  And then... 

     A BARRAGE OF FIRE breaks out!  The S.W.A.T. team is in the doorway,
     laying down everything they've got.  The creature ROARS as if betrayed,
     leaves Margo and LEAPS UP.  It barrels down on the S.W.A.T. team, picks
     up Jennings and SPIKES HIM TO THE GROUND.  Jennings hits the floor with
     his neck at a crazy angle.  It snaps like a twig.  The other men drop
     back.  Mbwun follows, tearing through the men, cutting a deathly swath!

     Pendergast moves to help the S.W.A.T. team.  Margo struggles to her
     feet and her hand touches the wall.  Beside her is a FIRE HOSE in a
     cabinet!  In a split second Margo hauls it out, throws a switch and
     gets a BLAST OF WATER.  She turns it on the beast as it grabs for
     Pendergast.  The force of the water is enormous.  It pushes the monster
     out the end of the hall.

     Pendergast runs towards her, takes the hose and holds it.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Run!

     She takes off blindly in the maze-like room.  From somewhere behind her
     she hears a horrible HOWL.

     ON MARGO... as she twists and turns through the rows of display cases,
     tearing blindly in the dark.  Ahead is a door.  She dives through it and
     finds she's in... 

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - MUSEUM - NIGHT

     A row of mirrors and urinals line the wall.  It's a huge room, designed
     to handle crowds of visitors.  Margo ducks into one of the stalls as
     MBWUN crashes in.  Margo looks through a crack in the door to see... 

     THE ANIMAL AT FULL STOP.  IT'S STARING AT ITSELF IN THE ROW OF MIRRORS!
     The sight appalls it and the beast lets out a hideous sound!  The claws
     lash out, breaking every mirror in the place, littering the floor with
     glass!

     Then the beast turns and backs up, groaning, as if cornered.  Margo
     sees now that one limb is dragging, leaving a trail of blood.  The
     mouth, too, appears to be bleeding.  The S.W.A.T. team's bullets had an
     affect.

     Margo presses back in the stall, bracing as the beast gets closer.
     It's just outside.  It sniffs the air once and suddenly turns, rears
     up, furious and crashes through the bathroom door.  Margo screams and
     the thing grabs her!  It holds Margo up before it and roars.  It closes
     its massive claws around her as if she is somehow responsible for
     everything.  The claws tighten!  She struggles and fights to no purpose
     ... but then the beast pauses... it's seen something!

     THE NECKLACE WITH TWO ARROWS AROUND HER NECK!

     It stops and its grip loosens!  A pained look flashes across its
     bestial face... 

     And in that split moment Margo looks down... 

     A NECKLACE OF SILVER gleams around the beast's throat too!  The
     necklace is the twin to her own!

     ON MARGO... Can it be possible?  She stares at the thing... 

                              MARGO
                    John's necklace!  You killed him!

     Incredibly the beast shakes its head.  A noise comes from it... a sad
     noise, like a groan.  And now Margo gets it!  She can hardly believe it.
     Her eyes widen in astonishment.  She whispers... 

                              MARGO
                    Oh Jesus.  John?

     The name is a knife through the monster's heart!

                              MARGO
                    No.  It's not possible!

     The last piece of the puzzle falls.  The monster is John Whittlesley!
     Margo, still desperately frightened, tries to keep control.

                              MARGO
                    John?  If it is you... I can help.

     The monster shakes its head no and releases her.  As she watches he
     moves away, quickly limps out the door.

     INT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT

     Mbwun now drags himself across the grey carpet, headed for the stairs.
     In the darkness of the hall of Asian Peoples, Pendergast is waiting.
     He lifts one of the S.W.A.T. team rifles which he holds in his hands.
     He aims, is about to fire, but then Margo comes up behind him.

                              MARGO
                    No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you
                    were right.  It's John!

                              PENDERGAST
                    What?

                              MARGO
                    That thing is John Whittlesley.  I
                    should have seen it before!  The
                    fibers are infected with a virus.
                    You eat them, and the virus alters
                    your DNA!  He became addicted to them
                    in South America, followed the
                    plants back to the states.  He
                    probably entered the country as a
                    man.  It would have taken several
                    months for the change to take place.
                    That's how he got from the boat to
                    the museum!

     Pendergast looks over and sees the monster.  His eyes show disbelief.
     Mbwun looks back at both of them briefly, then it disappears up the
     stairs.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I don't believe it.

                              MARGO
                    You have to!  Listen!  All viruses
                    pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the
                    cells of the host to make more
                    viruses!  This one was different.  It
                    inserted a whole array of genes into
                    John.  Reptile genes, sixty five
                    million years old.  Those genes
                    remade him!  It's not his fault!

                              PENDERGAST
                    Whatever that thing is, we have to
                    kill it!

     Margo tries to stop him, but he shrugs her off.

     EXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT

     A helicopter hovers outside pouring a circle of light down on the
     roof.  Ippolito watches as the drunk is pulled up through the hall in a
     sling.  Waters approaches, holding the walkie talkie.

                              WATERS
                    We can't raise the S.W.A.T. team.  No
                    one's answering!  What do you want to
                    do?

     Ippolito eyes are fixed on the room below them.

                              IPPOLITO
                    Holy shit.  Pull him up.

     Lightning throws horrible shadows of the hulking dinosaur skeletons
     all around as MBWUN LIMPS INTO THE HALL!  The men on the roof stare
     down astonished.  Their mouths hang open at the sight!

                              IPPOLITO
                    Get more guns!  Now!

     The men get the drunk up and abandon the sling, leaving Jonathan
     trapped below.

     INT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT

     Jonathan and Hobbes take cover behind one of the dinosaurs and hide.
     Mbwun sees Jonathan, lifts both claws, SWINGS at the skeleton, sending
     it crashing down!  Jonathan SCREAMS, Hobbes is caught and falls.  He
     scrambles into a corner, whimpering, as Pendergast and Margo appear in
     the door.  Fifteen more S.W.A.T. team members with rifles now line the
     hole in the roof.  They all point their guns at Mbwun.

                              IPPOLITO
                    Get back!  We're going to shoot!

     Now Margo runs forward.

                              MARGO
                    No.  Wait!  Let me talk to him first!

                              IPPOLITO
                        (screaming)
                    Kill that thing!  Kill it now!

                              MARGO
                    No!

     MBWUN... turns and sees Margo.  She speaks desperately.

                              MARGO
                    John... you can give up now!  Just lie
                    down where you are!

     Mbwun seems to consider for a moment, but then its eyes gleam and it
     ROARS.  With renewed vigor it leaps to the wall and starts to WALK UP
     IT like a GECKO, ON ALL FOURS!  ON THE ROOF... 

     Some of the S.W.A.T. team fall back in terror!  Now that the monster is
     on the wall it's out of range of their fire!

                              WATERS
                    Holy shit it's coming this way!

                              IPPOLITO
                    It's headed for the roof.  Run!

     Ippolito turns and takes off once more in sheer terror.  Astonished,
     Waters tries to regain control.

                              WATERS
                    Get back here, you asshole!  We can't
                    let it get out!
                        (to the S.W.A.T. team)
                    Surround the opening and kill it!

     But the men are terrified, retreating like Ippolito.  Waters shouts.

                              WATERS
                    Back, everybody!  That's an order!

     But the team is in chaos and losing precious time.

     INT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT

     The MONSTER is now half way up the wall.  Margo is distraught, crying.
     Her cool demeanor is cracked.  Pendergast is with her.  She shakes her
     head.

                              MARGO
                    Just like John.  He won't listen.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I have to shoot.

                              MARGO
                    Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the
                    eye.

     Pendergast raises a HIGH POWERED RIFLE with a laser sight.  He aims the
     red laser beam directly at Mbwun's left eye.

                              PENDERGAST
                    He has to look here or I won't get a
                    clear shot.  Call him, Margo.

                              MARGO
                    I can't!

                              PENDERGAST
                    You have to.  Do it now!

     Margo takes a moment, her eyes streaming.  She has no choice, she calls
     out.

                              MARGO
                    John!  John, look at me!

     The beast looks down, sees Pendergast's rifle.  There's a long, awful,
     moment.  Suddenly it emits a sound like a wail.

     ON JONATHAN... staring, stunned.

     PENDERGAST... steady... 

     MARGO... She's crying as she raises her arm as if to say good-bye.

     And the gun EXPLODES.

     ON MBWUN... its head shoots back in pain, and it falls... sixty feet
     straight down to the ground.  Silence.  Thunder rolls.

     It's over.  Pendergast turns to Margo and quietly folds her in his
     arms.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

     There are cops and journalists, ambulances, and medivacs all over the
     place.  Greg Kawakita, wet and bedraggled as a rat, runs up from
     Columbus Ave.  Behind him the Mayor and D'Agosta help the rest of the
     company to the ambulances.

     Waters is on the steps of the museum, helping to organize the rescue
     efforts as Kawakita runs up to Pendergast.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Margo Green.  Have you seen her?

                              PENDERGAST
                    She's over here.

     Greg turns to see Margo come out of the Rotunda with Frock, Jonathan
     and Hobbes.  Her face is devastated.  He moves to her side.  She reacts
     as she sees him, and teacher and pupil hug.

     D'AGOSTA is lost in the swirl of people.  And he likes it like that.  He
     rests against a large stone lion, pulls out a cheap cigar in
     cellophane, unwraps it carefully and tries to light it with a wet
     match.

     He's struggling hopelessly.  Finally he tosses the useless pack of
     matches, sighs.  But then a flame lowers right before his face.  He
     looks up to see Pendergast holding a silver engraved lighter.  D'Agosta
     smiles, takes a nice long hit.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Nice to see you, Lieutenant.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.

     We go to a wide shot of the museum as we slowly pull back... 

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DAY - SUPER TITLE: SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

     Christmas decorations are up.  A light snow is falling.  There is a very
     long line.

     INT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - GIFT SHOP - DAY

     All the registers are doing a booming business.  People are buying
     Mbwun posters, t-shirts and hats.

     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - DAY

     School tours, old ladies, parents and children, foreign tourists with
     cameras snake through the displays.  In the room with the Relic,
     there's a tremendous crowd.

     INT. MARGO'S LABORATORY - DAY

     Margo closes her computer, looks out a window at the falling snow.  She
     turns and walks into the back office.  Kawakita is working there alone.
     His fly-fishing rod stands in the corner, untouched.  Margo goes to it,
     smiles softly.

                              MARGO
                    No time for fishing anymore?

     Greg looks up from his work and smiles.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Got to finish this thesis sometime.

                              MARGO
                    How about lunch?

                              KAWAKITA
                    Not today.  Besides, I think the
                    director of the museum is expecting
                    you.

                              MARGO
                    Okay.

     Margo exits.  Greg returns to his work.

     INT. HALLWAYS - MUSEUM - DAY

     Margo heads down the hall to the Director's office.  She walks through
     the new double oak doors to find DR. FROCK seated at Cuthbert's old
     desk.

                              MARGO
                    Dr. Frock?

                              FROCK
                    Look who's here, Margo.

     PENDERGAST and D'AGOSTA rise out of two high-backed chairs.  Margo
     smiles for the first time, takes Pendergast's hands.

                              MARGO
                    I'm so glad to see you.  What's the
                    occasion?

                              PENDERGAST
                    I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to
                    see Vince and we thought we'd see
                    the new display.

     INT. HALL OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - DAY

     Margo, Pendergast, and D'Agosta follow Frock past the familiar
     dioramas.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What
                    happened to the rest of
                    Whittlesley's plants?

                              FROCK
                    They were sent to the Center For
                    Disease Control in Atlanta.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Shouldn't a drug that powerful be
                    destroyed?

                              FROCK
                    The virus itself might have positive
                    applications.  They'll keep the
                    plants in secure lock up while the
                    studies are made.
                        (beat)
                    Greg isn't joining us?

                              MARGO
                    He's changed.  He's always working on
                    his thesis.  He comes in early, stays
                    late.  I tried to get him to join us,
                    but he never takes a break.

     They pause on a NEW DIORAMA.  It's huge, filling one entire end of the
     hall.  In the center is a life-sized representation of MBWUN standing
     on the tepui amid the plants.  Behind is a painting of John Whittlesley
     as he once was.  He wears the necklace with the two arrows, of silver
     and gold.  As Margo looks, she touches her own.  Pendergast turns to
     her, sympathy in his eyes.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We did the right thing, Margo.

     Margo smiles warmly.

                              MARGO
                    Yes.  I know.

     INT. MARGO'S LABS - DAY

     Greg Kawakita wears gloves, high powered glasses, works in solitude in
     the lab.  Suddenly he stands up, throws off the glasses, then he sits
     down again.  He seems to be struggling with himself.  He glances over
     his shoulder to make sure he's alone.  Quickly he moves to a locked
     drawer.  He opens it with a key from his pocket and takes out a small
     envelope, looks inside.

     INSERT... the envelope is full of the PLANT FIBERS!  Greg has managed to
     keep his own cache!

     Moving quickly, with jerky motions, he lays one fiber down on a slide
     with a shaking hand.  With an exacto knife, he cuts off a tiny sliver,
     pops it into his mouth.  He closes his eyes in ecstasy and savors the
     taste.  Then he cuts one more infinitesimal sliver, leaves it on the
     slide.  He takes a deep breath, returns the envelope to the drawer.  He
     turns the key carefully and we GO CLOSE ON HIS HAND... 

     On the back is A ROW OF SCALES...

     TITLE CARD... BELEM BRAZIL - JULY... 

     EXT. BELEM STREETS - NIGHT

     A taxi careens down narrow roadways at breakneck speeds.

     INT. TAXI - NIGHT

     In the back seat is WHITTLESLEY. Early 40's, the wreck of a once
     handsome man. Unshaven.  Sweat stained.  Rail thin.  Scratches on his
     arms, a fresh scar on one cheek.  As the taxi roars downhill towards
     the harbor, Whittlesley leans over the front seat.  (Italics indicate
     Portuguese to be subtitled)

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Faster!  We won't make it.

                              DRIVER
                    You want to die?

     Whittlesley pulls out A KNIFE, puts it to the driver's jugular vein.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Do you?

     Sweat pouring down his brow, the driver re-doubles his speed.

     EXT. BELEM STREETS - NIGHT

     The taxi swerves around a corner, nearly crashing into a fruit cart,
     flies out of sight.

     EXT. HARBOR - BELEM - NIGHT

     Light rain obscures the bulky outlines of tethered freighters.  We hear
     faint laughter leavened with Portuguese phrases, distant Calypso music
     from waterfront bars.  One of the smaller boats, the SANTA LUCIA, is
     loading as the TAXI fishtails to a halt.

     Whittlesley gets out, sees the boat still at dock.  His face floods
     with relief.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Thank God.

     He tosses a handful of bills into the driver's lap, sprints up the
     pier as the driver shouts curses after him in Portuguese.  Whittlesley
     shoves past the dock hands as the last load goes onto the Santa Lucia.
     The boat's engines churn to life.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    I need to speak to the captain!
                    Where is he?

     The sailors hold Whittlesley back.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Get your hands off me!  I'm trying
                    to save your lives, you fools!

     Several crew members murmur the word "loco".  Hearing the commotion, a
     squat man wearing a billed hat and smoking a cigar approaches.  CAPTAIN
     FRANCO.

                              FRANCO
                    American?

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Yes.  Thank Christ somebody speaks
                    English.  I'm Dr. John Whittlesley.
                    You have some crates of mine on
                    board.  They were shipped by mistake
                    to the Natural History Museum.  We
                    have to get them off the boat.

                              FRANCO
                    You have I.D.?

     Whittlesley runs a trembling hand through his hair, trying to keep
     control and appear reasonable.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    No.  Let me explain.  I was on an
                    expedition for the museum on the
                    Upper Xingu.  Something horrible
                    happened.  I'm the only one who got
                    out alive.  I lost everything, my
                    I.D., everything.  I have to make
                    sure no one else dies.  The crates,
                    the crates were sent out before we
                    knew.  There's something unspeakable
                    inside.  If your boat leaves harbor
                    with those crates on board, I can't
                    be responsible.  My God, if they
                    reach New York... 

     Whittlesley's fists clench spasmodically.  Franco looks to his men.

                              FRANCO
                    Loco.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    No!  I'm not crazy!  As God is my
                    witness, I'm telling the truth.

     Franco barks an order and several sailors grab Whittlesley by the
     arms.  They start to lead him back to shore.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Don't do this!  You have to believe
                    me.  Your lives are in danger.

     The sailors laugh.  But with an almost super-human strength born of
     desperation, Whittlesley throws them off.  He pulls out his wallet.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    Cash.  Cash, you see?  American money.

     Whittlesley throws the money down on the deck.  The breeze scatters the
     bills across the bow and all the men, including Captain Franco,
     scramble for the money, chattering in Portuguese.  While they are
     occupied, Whittlesley slips by unnoticed and disappears below deck.

     INT. HOLD - SANTA LUCIA - NIGHT

     Whittlesley ducks between cages of goats, boxes of farm equipment, his
     movements jerky with panic.  As he continues searching, the camera
     moves past him, into the darkness of the hold.  We hear Whittlesley
     mumbling between low, ragged breaths.  At the back of the boat the
     camera finds... 

     A STACK OF CRATES... clearly labeled NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM.  Move in on
     these as... The CRATES VIBRATE.  The boat has started to move!
     Whittlesley stands bolt upright, realizing what's going on.

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    No!

     Too late.  He turns to run back on deck but then stops, sniffs the air.
     A look of desperation fills his eyes.  With one hand he pulls out THE
     KNIFE, and unexpectedly puts it to HIS OWN NECK.  Better to kill
     himself than face what comes next.  The knife touches... 

     A NECKLACE of TWO ARROWS, one gold, another silver.

     Whittlesley stares wide-eyed into the blackness of the hold.  The goats
     start BLEATING in blind panic.  A shaft of moonlight comes through a
     porthole as the boat turns.  The moonlight falls on

     THE CRATES.  Whittlesley's eyes lock onto them and he inches towards
     them, drawn inexorably closer... closer... 

                              WHITTLESLEY
                    No... no... 

     He begins mumbling a prayer.

     MOVE IN ON HIS EYES... filled with dread as he falls to his knees,
     staring, always staring at THE CRATES... 

     EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

     The crew tends to business and the Santa Lucia points out of the
     harbor, disappears into the night.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. LOUISIANNA COAST - DAY... TITLE CARD... JUNE

     Squad cars roar down the back roads, sirens flashing.  In the center of
     the column is an unmarked car.

     INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

     At the wheel is a strikingly dignified and imposing black man wearing
     a simple, old-fashioned dark suit, narrow black tie, and white shirt.
     This is SPECIAL AGENT PENDERGAST, FBI.

     A BACH SONATA for violin and harpsichord plays on the tape deck.
     Pendergast hums along as he drives.  A SMALL TOWN COP rides shotgun.
     The cop is intimidated both by Pendergast and the morning's events.  He
     sweats heavily as he brings Pendergast up to date.

                              SMALL TOWN COP
                    One of the locals found it at dawn.
                    Didn't believe him 'till I saw it
                    myself.  Even then I didn't believe
                    it.  Scared my men shitless.  Me too.
                    I mean... hell... You could smell it a
                    half mile away, Mr. Pendergast.

                              PENDERGAST
                        (unperturbed)
                    Any of your men go on board?

                              SMALL TOWN COP
                    No sir.  No way.  None of us wanted
                    to, I'm the first to admit it.  I
                    said, "Don't get within a mile of
                    this thing.  It's way to big for us.
                    I'm calling the FBI."

     Pendergast nods his approval, resumes humming along with a
     particularly intricate harpsichord riff.  As always, the man is
     unflappable and totally calm as he drives.

     EXT. LOUISIANA BEACH - DAY

     The ocean is still, the air stifling and close.  A hot sun beats down
     on the deck of the SANTA LUCIA.  The boat lists at a crazy angle where
     it has been washed up on the shore.  At first glance, it appears to be
     deserted.  A barrel rolls back and forth as the boat is rocked by each
     successive wave.  We hear sirens approaching and the phalanx of squad
     cars pulls up.  Joining them now are TWO AMBULANCES.

     PENDERGAST gets out along with the others.  All of the cops immediately
     cover their faces, gagging violently at the smell.  Pendergast sniffs
     once and frowns.  Apart from this, he doesn't react.

                              SMALL TOWN COP
                        (choking)
                    Goin' up-wind if you don't mind.

     Pendergast nods.  The cops all fall back in revulsion.  They watch from
     a safe distance as Pendergast approaches the ghost ship.  His shiny
     laced wing-tips sink in the sand.  He leans down, pulls them off one at
     a time.  He balls both socks, puts them carefully into his shoes and
     proceeds barefoot towards the boat.

     Using a piece of driftwood as a plank, Pendergast leans it against the
     Santa Lucia.  With surprising agility, he leaps up the plank to the
     deck.  At the top he touches a rail.  It's covered in a DARK STICKY
     LIQUID.

     BLOOD.  Flies buzz loudly.  A LARGE MACHETE lies abandoned in the stern.
     Chairs are overturned.  A DEAD GOAT, eviscerated, lies in the bow.  A
     lifeboat hangs half off the stern.  Pendergast moves aft.  The COPS
     watch from the sand below, unwilling to get any closer.  Pendergast
     hears A DOOR slamming open and closed.  He follows the noise and
     sees... 

     THE DOOR TO THE HOLD.  He approaches, pushes it open and looks down the
     stairwell.  Below deck are

     BODIES... stacks of them.  They've been TORN TO SHREDS.

     THE CAMERA MOVES down to one particular man who is nearest the top of
     the stairs.  It's CAPTAIN FRANCO.  His face is frozen in a howl of
     terror.  Flies congregate in the eye sockets.  With his foot, Pendergast
     nudges the body over.  The skull has been torn open.

     THERE IS NO BACK TO FRANCO'S HEAD.

     FADE TO BLACK:

     Silence then we begin hearing sounds of the city... horns, traffic,
     construction work.

     SUPER TITLE... NEW YORK CITY, FOUR MONTHS LATER as we... 

     FADE IN:

     ON A NECKLACE of TWO ARROWS, one of gold, the other silver.  The twin
     to the one seen on Whittlesley.  Widen to... 

     EXT. ROOFTOP GARDEN - MARGO'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING

     And the woman wearing the necklace... MARGO GREEN.  She sips her morning
     coffee as she makes notes on several large FOSSILIZED TEETH.  Her hair
     is neatly combed.  No make-up.  She doesn't need it.  She has a natural,
     unselfconscious beauty and a mind like a steel trap.

     At Margo's elbow is a small T.V.  A CNN world news report plays.
     Margo's New York Times is open to the crossword puzzle, which she's
     been doing rapidly, in ink.  Clearly this is a woman who likes order,
     with a mind that can handle more than one thing at a time.

     An alarm on her watch beeps and she fills in the last two lines of the
     crossword puzzle, makes one final note on the fossil specimens, and
     shuts off the T.V.  She reaches for her back pack and looks out at
     CENTRAL PARK with remarkably clear eyes.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

     HELICOPTER SHOT... Swooping over the fall foliage of the Park, a riot
     of color and botanical life... The camera picks out MARGO'S BICYCLE
     making its way along the winding roads, dodging taxi cabs.  Margo wears
     jeans, a work shirt, a fine blue gabardine jacket with a rhinestone
     DOUBLE HELIX PIN.  On her back is a LEATHER BACK PACK which holds her
     lap top computer.  She emerges from the park, catches the green light
     and rolls up to... 

     EXT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY

     As Margo arrives, the camera moves up and over the building, comes to
     rest on the imposing turrets, intersecting roof lines, and Gothic
     arches of the MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.  This is not an ordinary
     building; it's a 19th century monument to science and mankind.  The
     structure fills an entire city block.

     Happy visitors pour into the museum as Margo takes the imposing wide
     stone steps two at a time.  We hear SCREAMS of pleasure and release,
     the normal raucous noises of a large group of THIRD GRADE CHILDREN.
     Margo is amused to find herself surrounded by kids.  Their teacher,
     MRS. BEASLEY, a stern woman in glasses with a thick New York accent,
     calls after them as they all head inside.

                              MRS. BEASLEY
                    Don't run, children!  Stay with your
                    partner and do not run!  If anyone
                    runs they will be sent back to the
                    bus!

     Ignoring Mrs. Beasley, TWO BOYS charge past Margo.  HENRY and LARRY.
     Henry has a buzz cut; Larry has rasta dread knots.  Both are 8 years
     old, wear high top sneakers and shorts so big they graze their ankles.

                              MRS. BEASLEY
                    Henry!  Larry!  What did I just say!
                    You walk right this minute!  Did you
                    hear me?!

     Reluctantly, Henry and Larry slow to a rapid race-walk as they reach
     the huge doorway flanked by two Northwest Coast Indian totem poles.
     Above the doorway WORKMEN are hanging a LARGE BANNER.  It reads:
     "SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT... OPENING OCT. 29"

     INT. MUSEUM ROTUNDA/STAIRWELL - DAY

     The school children burst into a three story space dominated by a
     life-sized statue of a HERD OF ELEPHANTS.  The kids chatter with
     excitement, look up in awe.  Margo nods to a GUARD who smiles as she
     pins on a plastic I.D.

                              GUARD
                    Morning, Dr. Green.

                              MARGO
                    Morning Joe.  Beautiful day.

     Henry watches Margo pass through the turnstiles without paying.  He
     swaggers over.

                              HENRY
                    You work here?

                              MARGO
                    Yes, I do.

                              HENRY
                    What do you do?

                              MARGO
                        (leans down, amused)
                    I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What
                    do you do?

                              HENRY
                    Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's
                    a revolutionary what ch'a ma'
                    callit?

                              MARGO
                    Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how
                    life on earth evolved over millions
                    of years.

                              HENRY
                        (brightens)
                    Way cool.  Then you know where the
                    dinosaurs are.

                              MARGO
                    Fourth floor, West wing, but stay
                    with your class.

     Mrs. Beasley heads into the museum and Larry and Henry merge with the
     rest of the kids.  Margo turns towards the stairwell, passing... 

     IAN CUTHBERT... Museum Director... a pudgy man in wire rim glasses who
     dresses and thinks like a banker.  Hired for his amazing ability to
     raise money, Cuthbert is one of a new generation of Museum Directors
     whose focus must always be on the bottom line.

                              MARGO
                    Hello, Ian.  Everything ready for the
                    opening of the Superstition Exhibit?

                              CUTHBERT
                    I'm on my way to get the last piece
                    out of storage right now.

                              MARGO
                    I'd wish you luck but I'm not
                    superstitious.

                              CUTHBERT
                    You will be after tomorrow night.

     Cuthbert waves merrily.  A workman uses a LADDER in the stairwell.
     Cuthbert is about to walk under the ladder, stops and carefully walks
     around it instead.  Margo smiles, goes on upstairs.

     INT. MUSEUM BASEMENT - DAY

     Cuthbert enters from the lower stairwell.  He is now in one of the
     hundreds of areas of the museum that are closed to the the general
     public.  He follows a labyrinthine route down a dim passageway lined
     with rumbling steam pipes.  There are storage areas on both sides
     labeled ORNITHOLOGY, HERPITOLOGY, CENTRAL ASIA EXPEDITIONS, AKELEY
     EXPEDITIONS, WHALE BONE FOSSILS and so on.  Finally Cuthbert comes to a
     door marked

     "WHITTLESLEY EXPEDITIONS 1978-95".  Cuthbert pauses and gets out a key,
     but to his surprise the door pushes open.  The lock and doorknob
     mechanism are both broken off!  Cuthbert frowns.

                              CUTHBERT
                    What the... ?

     He goes inside.

     INT. WHITTLESLEY COLLECTION BASEMENT - DAY

     Cuthbert flips on a light to see a tall, narrow space.  Stacks of metal
     shelves reach up into the gloom.  Everywhere we see spears, shields,
     masks, various artifacts.  Ancient tribal costumes lie shrouded in
     plastic like corpses against the walls.  And in the middle of the
     gloom, sitting ominously in the light of a sole hanging bulb are... 

     THE WHITTLESLEY CRATES.  The same ones last seen in the hold of the
     ill-fated Santa Lucia.  They are scattered about in disarray.  One in
     particular has been broken open, its contents spread on the floor.
     Cuthbert mutters in surprise and dismay, kneels by the crate.

                              CUTHBERT
                    No, it can't be.

     Cuthbert feels gently through the packing material, lets out a sigh of
     relief as he pulls out a figurine.  It is a small, beautifully carved
     statue of A MONSTER crouched on all fours.

     The room falls totally silent as Cuthbert studies THE RELIC.  It's a
     truly frightening piece... massive, razor sharp claws, large round
     nostrils, enormous teeth and red rimmed eyes.  Suddenly Cuthbert sees a
     DROP OF BLOOD on his hand!  He's been CUT!

                              CUTHBERT
                    Damn.

     Cuthbert rises, shakes his finger in pain.  Blood drips on the floor.
     He pulls out his pocket handkerchief and wraps the wound.  The
     handkerchief rapidly soaks through.  Suddenly a HAND CLAMPS on
     Cuthbert's shoulder!  He's not alone!  He lets out a YELP, almost
     dropping the Relic and spins to see... 

     A MUSEUM GUARD standing behind him.  His nameplate reads... BEAUREGARD.
     He's a gentle young fellow with white blond hair and a rolling
     southern accent.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Beauregard!  You scared me half to
                    death.

                              BEAUREGARD
                    I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?

                              CUTHBERT
                    Someone broke into this room.

                              BEAUREGARD
                    Anything missin'?

                              CUTHBERT
                    Doesn't look like it.  We're damned
                    lucky.  This statue is priceless.

     Cuthbert holds up the RELIC of THE MONSTER.  Beauregard stares.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Mbwun.  A South American warrior
                    deity.  He carries a powerful curse.
                    Every member of the expedition that
                    found this statue, died.

     Beauregard sees Cuthbert's cut finger.

                              BEAUREGARD
                    Looks like the curse is still at
                    work.

                              CUTHBERT
                    The claws are sharp... I must have
                    cut myself.
                        (uneasy laugh)
                    Better move these crates to the
                    secure storage area where they'll be
                    safe.

     Beauregard studies the door as Cuthbert heads out with the figurine.

                              BEAUREGARD
                    Don't know if it'll do any good, Mr.
                    Cuthbert.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Why not?

                              BEAUREGARD
                    No one broke into this room, sir.
                    Someone broke out.  That lock was
                    torn off from the inside.

     Cuthbert glances at the evil face of Mbwun, pales.  As he exits, HOLD
     ON BEAUREGARD, left alone with the crates.

     INT. PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB - DAY

     Huge centrifuges, hissing autoclaves, electrophoresis apparati,
     glowing monitors, elaborate blown-glass distillation columns and
     titration set-ups.  One of the most advanced technical facilities of
     its kind.  And mixed in with all the modern machinery are

     SKELETONS OF ALL KINDS.  Complete homo sapien specimens are scattered
     around the room.  Standing midst all this is GREGORY KAWAKITA, early
     twenties.  Kawakita makes sharp, jerky overhead movements with his left
     hand, waving something about.  He's practicing casting.  We hear the
     zing of a line and the whirring of the fly reel as MARGO ENTERS.  A fly
     whips out, passing right under her nose.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Third from the end!  Right shoulder.
                    Aleut, provenance unknown.

     The fly zooms across the room and lights on the shoulder of the third
     skeleton from the end, labeled "Aleut, provenance unknown." Margo
     rolls her eyes and Kawakita smiles with pride.

                              KAWAKITA
                    If I spent half the time on my
                    Fractal Evolution thesis that I
                    spend on this fly rod, I'd have my
                    PhD.

                              MARGO
                        (small smile)
                    But at what a price.

     Kawakita reels in his line as Margo drops her backpack on her large
     desk.  An enormous MICROSCOPE stands by the equally imposing computer
     topped by a tiger skull.  A screen saver of an animated pterodactyl
     plays.  Margo unpacks boxes of fossil teeth, hits some keys revealing
     columns of seemingly indecipherable chemical equations on the computer
     screen.

                              MARGO
                    I have the species identification on
                    these teeth.  We can extract DNA and
                    start running tests on the
                    extrapolator program.  Call Dr.
                    Frock.  He wanted a demonstration.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Margo, you haven't heard?

                              MARGO
                    What?

                              KAWAKITA
                    Frock's been fired.

     Margo straightens, stunned.

                              MARGO
                    That's impossible.

                              KAWAKITA
                        (awkward)
                    I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad
                    tidings, but you know me.  Telegraph.
                    Telephone.  Tell Kawakita.  I got the
                    definitive word from Cuthbert's
                    secretary.  This is Dr. Frock's last
                    week.

     Margo is already out the door.

     INT. CORRIDORS/STAIRWELL - MUSEUM - DAY

     Margo charges through double doors leading into the southwest tower.
     She half runs down an elegant, Edwardian fifth-floor corridor, her
     footsteps lost in the thick carpet.  At the very end is a heavy oak
     door bearing a plate entwined with bronze leaves that reads simply
     "Dr. Frock".

     INT. FROCK'S OFFICE - DAY

     Margo bursts into the unique office, which is in startling contrast to
     the modernity of her own.  Two large bow windows look out over the
     park.  Upholstered Victorian chairs in a leaf motif sit on needlepoint
     carpets featuring large red roses.  Plant specimens and drawings of
     flora and fauna line the walls.  Cardboard boxes cover the floor.
     Seated in a wheelchair is a white-haired man in a tweed jacket and a
     loud floral tie.  Glasses slip down his nose.

     This is DR. FROCK, and he's in the middle of packing.  He looks up,
     smiles apologetically.

                              DR. FROCK
                    Hello, Margo.  Sorry about the mess.

                              MARGO
                    Is it true?  Greg said you'd been
                    fired.

                              FROCK
                    Yes.  Bit of a shock.  But as Cuthbert
                    so tactfully put it, the museum
                    needs new blood.  And since I've been
                    here since the Mesozoic Era --

                              MARGO
                    I don't believe it.

                              FROCK
                    Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert
                    has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving
                    makes perfect sense.  This isn't
                    exactly early retirement.  I've
                    overstayed the party a bit.

                              MARGO
                    We can't do without you.  You're one
                    of the foremost authorities on
                    primitive pharmacology.  You're
                    practically an institution around
                    here.

                              FROCK
                    That, apparently, is the problem.
                    I'm yesterday's news.  Who needs a
                    Curator of Plant Biology in a museum
                    with one exhibit on plants?  Monsters
                    and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans
                    are the new currency of the realm.

     Frock goes back to his work packing to hide his emotion and Margo
     moves to his side.  She pulls Frock's books back out of the box,
     returns them to his desk.

                              MARGO
                    "Phyletic Transformation and the
                    Tertiary Fern Spike" is not going
                    anywhere.  I'll talk to Cuthbert and
                    put a stop to this right now.

     She starts for the door and Frock wheels into her path.  Now for the
     first time she sees what he's been carefully hiding... the deep pain in
     his eyes.

                              FROCK
                    Please.  Don't humiliate me further.

                              MARGO
                    Let me help.  I can take care of
                    everything.

                              FROCK
                    No, Margo.  This is one problem you
                    can't solve.  You have to stay out of
                    it.  The fact is, I want to retire.

                              MARGO
                    How can you say that?  You know it's
                    not true.

                              FROCK
                    Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no
                    longer needed --

                              MARGO
                    My work on fossil intermediates
                    would be crippled without you.

                              FROCK
                    With all due respect, dear, that's
                    bull.  You dance rings around me with
                    your new technology.  You've left me
                    in the dust.

                              MARGO
                        (stubbornly loyal)
                    Your work is highly relevant.  What
                    about your display on Primitive
                    Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me
                    himself he was going to feature it
                    prominently in the Superstition
                    Exhibit.

                              FROCK
                    Healing plant use among the Ki tribe
                    of Bechuanaland has been cancelled
                    to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art.

     Frock reaches out and squeezes her hand gently with a look that says
     the discussion is over.

                              FROCK
                    Come on.  I'll walk you back to the
                    elevator.

                              MARGO
                    I'm not giving up.

                              FROCK
                    You must.

     INT. MUSEUM HALLWAYS - DAY

     Frock rolls back down the hall the way Margo just came.  Margo is
     beside him, downcast.  She's not used to defeat.

                              FROCK
                    This isn't a death sentence.  Greg
                    has promised to teach me fly
                    fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.

                              MARGO
                    You are this museum.  It won't be the
                    same without you.

                              FROCK
                    Everyone needs a change of scenery.
                    I've been rolling down these halls
                    for forty-odd years.  That's quite
                    enough.

     Margo gets in the elevator reluctantly.  He smiles and meets her eye.

                              FROCK
                    I'll see you at lunch.

     He waves her off merrily.  But once the doors close and Margo's out of
     sight, Frock's smile fades and his shoulders sag.  He ducks his
     wheelchair quickly into the Hall of African Mammals.

     INT. HALL OF AFRICAN MAMMALS - AFTERNOON

     Two stories high, dark and dramatic.  A very special display.  Dioramas
     of lions, hippos, wart hogs etc.  In the middle is a large statue of a
     GORILLA beating its chest.  Frock takes refuge in the darkness of the
     exhibit.  His wheelchair sits in a quiet corner and we see him quickly
     wipe the back of his hands across his eyes.

     INT. MOLLUSKS EXHIBIT - DAY

     Shells and sea life line the walls.  A sign announces the exhibit
     "Mollusks and Our World."  The THIRD GRADE CLASS sweeps in.  Larry and
     Henry start to sing "Mollusks and Our World" to the tune of "Welcome
     to Our World", the F.A.O. Schwartz theme song.  Mrs. Beasley shoots
     them the evil eye and Henry whines... 

                              HENRY
                    Mrs. Beasley, it's almost time to go
                    and we still haven't seen the
                    dinosaurs!

                              BEASLEY
                    If you ask me about the dinosaurs
                    once more, I'II strangle you both!

     She starts to lecture about horseshoe crabs in a droning monotone.
     Henry and Larry hang back.

                              LARRY
                        (whispers)
                    This room sucks.

                              HENRY
                    She's never going to take us to see
                    the dinosaurs.  That lady said they
                    were on the fourth floor.

                              LARRY
                    Let's ditch and find them ourselves.

     They dart off down a side corridor and up a wide stairs.

     INT. REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS ROOM - DAY

     Larry and Henry emerge and walk wide-eyed among the cases of lizards,
     chameleons, tortoises.  High windows light the room.  Outside the sun is
     going down.  A woman pushing a child in a stroller exits and the boys
     have the hall to themselves.

                              LARRY
                    Look at this.  A Komodo dragon.

     As Larry checks out, the huge, dragon-like reptile, which has just
     sunk its Jaws into a stuffed boar.  Henry points to a stuffed Gecko
     climbing vertically up the side of its case.

                              HENRY
                    Check out this one.  It can walk up
                    walls.

     Larry already has his eyes on the far end of the hall where temporary
     barricades have been put up to prevent access to the next room.
     Painting is in progress.  Scaffolding just begs to be climbed.  Henry
     runs over and starts up the scaffolding.  Larry hesitates.

                              LARRY
                    We're not supposed to go back there.

                              HENRY
                    Chicken.  This is a great short cut.

     Henry drops on the other side of the scaffolding and Larry follows.  In
     a moment both disappear from sight.

     INT. MUSEUM HALL OF BIRDS - DAY

     Windowless and dark.  A closed display under maintenance.  Thousands of
     little stuffed birds line the walls from floor to ceiling, white
     cotton poking out of sightless eyes.  Henry and Larry enter and slow
     down.  Larry's getting scared.

                              LARRY
                    I don't want to go this way.

                              HENRY
                    Don't be a wuss.  Come on.

     The boys continue onward more slowly, their footfalls echoing in the
     silence.

     INT. BACK HALLWAYS - DAY

     The children are now far from the other tourists and their class.
     Larry is frightened.  The hall takes a sharp dog-leg, ending in a
     darkened cul-de-sac full of display cases filled with hideous carved
     masks.  Against the side of the chamber is a barricade of wood which
     looks much like a wall.  Henry tugs at it and the barricade moves.  He
     looks behind.

                              HENRY
                    Hey, there's a secret staircase back
                    here.  Cool.

     Henry disappears behind the barricade leaving Larry completely alone
     in the dark room with the Shaman masks.

                              LARRY
                    Henry, come back!

     Henry doesn't respond.  The lights in the cases throw strange shadows.
     Larry starts to sniffle, falls to hiccuping, sits down.  He pulls on a
     little flap of rubber that's coming off the toe of his sneaker, all
     bravado gone.

                              LARRY
                    Henry!  Henry!

     No answer.  Larry rises and peeks behind the barricade.  He sees the
     circular stair.  It descends into total darkness.  From below comes a
     strange smell that makes Larry's nose wrinkle.

                              LARRY
                    Henry?

     No answer.  Larry puts his first foot on the stair.

                              LARRY
                    Henry!  Come up!  Please!

     With no other option but staying alone in the dark, Larry follows
     Henry down.

     INT. SPIRAL STAIRCASE - DAY

     Larry clutches the banister, whispers... 

                              LARRY
                    Henry?  Where are you?  Henry?

     Larry takes another step.  Another.  And another.  He stops.  Below him he
     hears SNUFFLING, rather like a large dog.  Larry freezes, starts to
     cry.

                              LARRY
                    Henry!  Henry!  It smells awful.
                    Answer me!  Are you all right?

     Larry can barely see a dim hallway stretching out in two directions.
     He pauses near the bottom of the stairs, eyes wide, holding his
     breath.  There appears to be a darker area of SHADOW at the end of the
     hall.  It's gliding TOWARDS THEM!

     Suddenly something CLOSES on Larry's leg and he YELPS.  It's HENRY.
     Henry pulls Larry the rest of the way down the stairs.  They stand
     alone together in the darkness.  Henry hisses.

                              HENRY
                    Quiet!

                              LARRY
                    What is it?

                              HENRY
                    I don't know.  But I think it's bad.

     They keep their eyes locked on the shape at the end of the hall as
     they back up, step by step.  Move in as their faces suddenly TWIST WITH
     FEAR.  THE BOYS... SCREAM BLOODY MURDER... The sound echoes in the
     darkness as we... 

                                                            CUT TO:

     INT. MARGO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Margo sits up in the darkness, gasping.  Moonlight cuts across the bed.
     It takes a moment for her to realize that she's had a nightmare.  She
     reaches for her light.  As she switches it on, we see a photo on her
     bedside table.  It shows a group on a mountain in TIBET.  There are
     several people with their arms slung around each other.  At the end is
     a younger MARGO holding hands with JOHN WHITTLESLEY.  They appear to be
     more than friends.

     ON MARGO... she looks at the photo a moment, then turns off the light
     and lies back, alone in her bed.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY

     Yellow crime tape encircles the museum.  Dead leaves swirl in clusters
     and the sky is overcast.  Overnight, fall turned to winter.  The front
     of the museum is ringed with police cars.  Margo rides up on her bike
     and pauses, startled at the sight.  We watch as she crosses, has a few
     words with one of the officers who motions her to a side entrance.  She
     wheels her bike under a stone tunnel as we pick up... 

     A TAXI CAB arriving at the front entrance.  Out steps SPECIAL AGENT
     PENDERGAST.

     INT. LOWER ROTUNDA - DAY

     Margo enters.  The huge hall is taken up by an enormous boat carved
     from the trunk of a single tree.  Inside it are mannequins of Northwest
     Coast Indians.  Milling around are at least twenty COPS.  One
     approaches.

                              COP
                    ID.

     Worried, Margo hands it over.

                              MARGO
                    What's going on?

                              COP
                    All employees are to go to the IMAX
                    room for a briefing, Dr. Green.

     INT. SIDE HALL - MUSEUM - DAY

     Several cops go by with tracking dogs.  Margo looks back at the dogs,
     increasingly uneasy, almost bumps into... 

     HENRY AND LARRY.  Surprisingly, they are alive and well and seated with
     MRS. BEASLEY outside an office.  Margo exchanges a look with both boys,
     remembering them from yesterday.  A tentative smile starts but Henry
     and Larry don't return it.  Serious and chastened, they drop their
     eyes.  Margo continues on.

     TWO COPS stand outside the door to the rest room, their backs turned
     to Margo as she approaches.

                              COP ONE
                    What was that?  Six?

                              COP TWO
                    Lost count.

     Margo glances past them to see an OLDER MAN wearing the badge of a
     NIGHT WATCHMAN, leaning over a sink.  He wipes his mouth.  Margo's eyes
     move down to see... THE MAN'S SNEAKERS are soaked in blood.

     INT. HALL OF ADVANCED FOSSIL MAMMALS - DAY

     More cops gather, surrounded by skeletons of primates... humans,
     monkeys, gorillas.  It's an odd sight.  They all look up with interest
     as in walks the imposing figure of... 

     SPECIAL AGENT PENDERGAST.  He turns to a young eager beaver, OFFICER
     BAILEY, flashes his badge.  Bailey straightens to attention.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Could you please take me to the
                    officer in charge?

     INT. CIRCULAR STAIRWELL - DAY

     Pendergast follows Bailey as they descend the rickety old metal
     staircase that goes into the bowels of the museum.  The hall below them
     is narrowand lit by an occasional bare bulb.  The stairway opens onto a
     maze-like set of rooms in the basement.  Everything around them is
     STREAKED and SPATTERED in BLOOD.  There are trails of it on the floor,
     the walls, the overhead light.

     Several COPS stand guard as DETECTIVE VINCE D'AGOSTA goes over the
     area.  He is a round, balding, man with an unmistakable air of
     authority.  A modern knight in shining armor in disguise... deep
     disguise.  He has on a cheap polyester short sleeved shirt.  His t-shirt
     is plainly visible underneath.  On his worn plastic belt is a badge.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Don't touch anything until the
                    S.O.C.  has finished with those
                    stairs.  Keep everyone clear of the
                    perimeter.  I don't want any
                    contamination.  There's an incredible
                    amount of blood evidence down here.
                    We need more light.  Where's the
                    photographer?  Tell him to quit
                    eating donuts, I need him.

     As Pendergast enters, D'Agosta looks up at this serious African-
     American in simple black suit, white shirt and dark tie.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Who are you?  The undertaker?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Not at all.  I think we may be
                    working on the same case.  If so, I
                    could use your help.

     The two men shake hands.  They couldn't be more different.  Pendergast
     is an elegant intellectual... D'Agosta a working class spark plug who
     operates from the gut.  Pendergast gestures to the form on the ground.

                              PENDERGAST
                    The body?

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What's left of it.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Mind if I have a look?

     D'Agosta calls to A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER who comes down the staircase
     carrying lights, a donut stuffed in his mouth.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    We need light in here, stat.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Where's the head?

     D'Agosta points to a lump the size of a bowling ball that's in the
     corner.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Careful.  That mess on the ground is
                    brains.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Whose footprints?

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Night watchman who found the body.
                    Sweet old man.  Been tossing his
                    cookies for over an hour.  Not a
                    likely suspect.

     The photographer is finally ready and he floods the dark room with
     light.  And now everyone (but not us) gets a very clear look at the
     body.

     THE PHOTOGRAPHER... spits out his donut.  His eyes roll up and he drops
     in a dead faint.  Just like that.  D'Agosta swallows hard.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Woof.

     Pendergast looks down, utterly impassive.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Yes, I'd say we're definitely
                    working on the same case.

     INT. IMAX ROOM - DAY

     An old 19th century theater.  Balconies.  Heavy curtains.  It looks like
     the theater where Lincoln was shot, with the exception of the most
     recent addition, an IMAX SCREEN five stories high.  The room is filling
     with museum employees, all murmuring anxiously.  Margo sits down next
     to Frock's wheelchair.  Her face is ashen.

                              MARGO
                    Dr. Frock, I just saw a man back
                    there who'd been wading in blood.

     As Greg Kawakita sits in the chair next to Margo... 

                              MARGO (CON'T)
                    For once I'm glad you're rumor
                    central.  What in the world is going
                    on?

                              KAWAKITA
                    Someone's been murdered.  Not shot,
                    strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn
                    limb from limb.  There's talk of a
                    psychotic killer or even an animal.

                              FROCK
                    For heaven's sake, Greg, someone's
                    been killed.  Look, it's Cuthbert.
                    Let's hear what really happened.

     At this everyone falls silent and IAN CUTHBERT steps forward to
     address the crowd.  He appears drawn and grey.

                              CUTHBERT
                    This has been a tragic and upsetting
                    morning.  I have terrible news for us
                    all.  A member of our security force
                    has been found murdered.  The police
                    have just informed me it was Daniel
                    Beauregard.
                        (murmuring fills the room)
                    Quiet.  Please.  With the help of our
                    head of security, Mr. Ippolito... the
                    museum has been secured.

     IPPOLITO... rises in the back and nods to the crowd... He's an imperious
     looking, pompous man with shifty eyes.  Right now he's defensive.
     Overnight, his job is on the line... 

                              CUTHBERT
                    The police are satisfied we're in no
                    danger, that we're all perfectly
                    safe.  We've been asked to remain in
                    the Gem Room and be available for
                    questioning for the rest of the day.
                    Obviously, we will all do everything
                    we can to cooperate.  Are there any
                    questions?

     Ippolito raises a hand.

                              IPPOLITO
                    The party for the opening of the
                    Superstition Exhibit... I imagine in
                    the light of what's happened it will
                    be pushed back.

                              CUTHBERT
                    No action has been taken yet.  The
                    opening of the exhibit is crucial to
                    the financial health of this museum.
                    So for now, we expect that the
                    Superstition Exhibit will open on
                    schedule, tomorrow night.

     Ippolito registers surprise.  The audience buzzes again.

     INT. GEM ROOM - DAY

     Margo, Dr. Frock and Greg Kawakita enter.  The room is full of
     spectacular displays of gemstones of every type.  Greg drapes himself
     over a grey sofa.  Margo leans on a giant geode.

                              MARGO
                    That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work.
                    Someone's dead and all he cares
                    about is his Superstition Exhibit.

                              FROCK
                    Cuthbert's counting on the
                    exhibition's success.  The museum is
                    in debt.  Contributions and public
                    funding have dried up.  Admissions no
                    longer cover overhead.  The last big
                    infusion of cash we had was the King
                    Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to
                    get us out of the red.  If the
                    Superstition Exhibit isn't
                    lucrative, he'll have to start
                    auctioning off some of these gems.

                              KAWAKITA
                    With all this bad publicity, it's no
                    wonder he looks like that.

     They glance over and see Cuthbert in the corner.  He appears ill, is
     compulsively fingering his watch chain from which hangs a RABBIT'S
     FOOT.  Frock goes over to speak to him, followed by Margo and Greg.

                              FROCK
                    Ian.  Are you okay?

                              CUTHBERT
                        (shakes his head)
                    Beauregard.  I can't believe it.  I
                    may have been the last one to see
                    him alive.  He was with me just
                    yesterday, when I got out the statue
                    of Mbwun.

                              MARGO
                        (taken aback)
                    Mbwun.

                              KAWAKITA
                        (sensing more gossip)
                    What's that?

     Margo frowns, suddenly uneasy.  She and Dr. Frock exchange a look.

                              MARGO
                    Warrior deity of the Kothoga, an
                    extinct South American tribe.  Dr.
                    John Whittlesley led an expedition
                    that found the only known
                    representation of Mbwun.  The statue
                    is said to carry a curse.
                        (she looks away, quiet)
                    Every member of Whittlesley's
                    expedition died.

                              CUTHBERT
                    I got the relic out yesterday to put
                    on display.  Beauregard was there.
                    The crates had been broken into and
                    the contents were strewn about.  But
                    nothing was missing.  It was
                    downright weird.  We joked that it
                    was the curse of Mbwun.  I'm not
                    laughing now.

                              FROCK
                    Come, Ian.  We all know you're
                    superstitious.  But you're among
                    scientists here.  We deal in facts.
                    That statue had nothing to do with
                    what happened to Beauregard.

                              CUTHBERT
                    All I know is, everyone who has come
                    in contact with that relic, is dead.

     INT. BUSINESS OFFICES - MUSEUM - DAY

     D'Agosta has set up a temporary command post among the antique desks
     and chairs.  The room is on the ground floor with a view of the park.
     Gawkers are outside looking in.  D'Agosta pulls the blinds in their
     faces.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (mutters)
                    Get a life.

     Pendergast is looking closely at one of the large paintings of birds
     that line the walls.

                              PENDERGAST
                    An original Roger Tory Peterson of a
                    Red-Breasted Merganser.  Amazing.  I
                    have a copy of this in my office at
                    home.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Can't really focus on birds at the
                    moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to
                    keep my breakfast down.

                              PENDERGAST
                    In this violent world, I believe the
                    only way to stay sane is to take
                    time to notice beautiful things.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I drink.  After hours of course.  On
                    duty, I smoke.
                        (he pulls out a fat cigar)
                    Do you mind?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a
                    good cigar.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Then you won't like this one.  It's a
                    piece of shit.

     He bites off the end, spits it out on the floor.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Lieutenant --

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Call me Vince.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Did you read about a boat that
                    washed up outside of New Orleans
                    about four months ago?  Twelve bodies
                    on board.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil,
                    wasn't it?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Yes.  That's my case.  Now it's yours.
                    All the corpses were badly mutilated
                    in a very particular way.
                    Decapitated.  Brains extracted.  Limbs
                    torn to shreds.  It looked like the
                    work of a large animal, but there
                    was no sign of an animal on board.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    So the method of death is the only
                    connection?

                              PENDERGAST
                    No.  There's more.  There were crates
                    from this museum in the hold of the
                    boat.

     BAILEY enters, interrupts.

                              BAILEY
                    Uh, Vince.  Sorry.  This won't wait.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    It better be good.

                              BAILEY
                    There are a couple of kids who were
                    lost yesterday near the site of the
                    murder.  Claimed they saw a monster.
                    They're pretty determined to tell
                    you their story.  You want to see
                    them?

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (rolls his eyes)
                    No.

                              PENDERGAST
                    If you don't mind, this could be
                    important.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    You're kidding.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Unfortunately, no.

     INT. MUSEUM CLASSROOM - DAY

     A modern classroom that has been taken over by the police for the
     purpose of interrogation.  Seated on small chairs at a plain table
     are... 

     HENRY and LARRY, looking like two little boys with a story they are
     desperate to share.  Standing behind them is MRS. BEASLEY, starchier
     than ever.  D'Agosta takes a chair across from the boys, at their eye
     level.  By this time of day he looks pretty rumpled and tired.
     Pendergast stands upright and unruffled in a doorway behind.  This
     isn't hard duty for D'Agosta.  He's surprisingly genial and at ease
     with kids.  Larry kicks his sneaker against the table leg in
     excitement.  Henry tugs his t-shirt.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Hi.  I'm Lieutenant D'Agosta.  You can
                    call me Vince.  This is Special Agent
                    Pendergast.  You can call him... 
                        (he looks to Pendergast, so formal)
                    Special Agent Pendergast.

                              BEASLEY
                    This is Henry Weiss and Larry
                    Bowers.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    So... Tell us about this monster.

                              LARRY
                    We were lost and trying to find a
                    short cut to the dino--

     Henry elbows him hard.  Larry shuts up.

                              HENRY
                    We were just lost, okay?  And we went
                    down this curvy staircase.  At the
                    bottom was a big shadow.

                              LARRY
                    Big as a house.

                              HENRY
                    Not that big.

                              LARRY
                    Well almost.  Depends which house.  It
                    smelled like old hamburger, and it
                    made this weird noise.

     Henry makes a low GROWL in his throat.  D'Agosta suppresses a smile,
     shoots Pendergast a look.  But Pendergast watches the kids intently.

                              LARRY
                    And it snuffled the ground like a
                    dog.

                              HENRY
                    Like this.

     He goes on hands and knees, sniffs the ground.

                              LARRY
                    It had a long tongue, teeth this big
                    and yellow eyes.

                              HENRY
                    They were green eyes and they were
                    slit like a lizard's.

                              LARRY
                    They were yellow!

                              HENRY
                    You're color blind.

                              BEASLEY
                    Boys, please!
                        (to D'Agosta)
                    These two get in a lot of mischief
                    and they tell some amazing whoppers.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I can see that.

                              HENRY
                    This isn't a whopper!  It's the
                    truth.

     Pendergast now moves forward, pulls up a chair as if deeply
     interested.

                              PENDERGAST
                    How did you get away?

                              HENRY
                    We ran and screamed and stuff.  And
                    we got through a little door just in
                    time.  There was a guard there and he
                    went back to check.

                              PENDERGAST
                    A guard?  Do you remember his name?

                              LARRY
                    He was wearing one of those I.D.
                    badges.  His name was Bo... something.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Beauregard?

                              LARRY
                    Yeah.

     EXT. MUSEUM - DAY

     An ambulance pulls away, lights flashing.  Pendergast and D'Agosta walk
     to a squad car.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I've got to admit, that was a damn
                    sight better than "the dog ate my
                    homework".

                              PENDERGAST
                    How do you explain the part about
                    Beauregard?

                              D'AGOSTA
                    They heard the victim's name and
                    wove him into their story.  Nice
                    touch.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I believed them.

     D'Agosta stops, stunned.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    You think what we've got here is a
                    monster as big as a house that
                    smells... like hamburger?

                              PENDERGAST
                    No.  I think what we've got here is a
                    psychotic killer wielding some kind
                    of unusual weapon... who wants us to
                    believe he's a monster.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (totally confused)
                    Oh.

     INT. NEW YORK CITY MORGUE - EVENING

     D'Agosta and Pendergast thread their way down a hall lined with bodies
     on gurneys.  It's dark and quiet.  They go into the autopsy room.

     INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - AFTERNOON

     A large gurney, currently empty, sits like an uninvited guest under
     the bright lights of the autopsy suite.  Beside it is a tall, imposing
     doctor in her late 50's, with intense eyes.  This is DR. ZIEWZIC.  With
     her are the PHOTOGRAPHER seen passing out at the museum, and a young
     intern, DOCTOR GROSS.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    You're late, Vince.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Sorry Dr. Ziewzic.  This is Special
                    Agent Pendergast.  Pendergast, Dr.
                    Ziewzic.  She runs the best chop shop
                    in New York.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards
                    you sent me that amazing case of
                    Chateau Lafitte.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I hope you liked it.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    Lovely bouquet.  After our last case,
                    Vince took me out for a draft beer.
                    As I recall we split the check.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (grumbles)
                    It's been one of those days.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                        (she snaps her rubber glove)
                    Shall we get down to it, then?

     Dr. Gross wheels the gurney over to the morgue bank and slides open a
     drawer.  The shape under the plastic seems too small to be human.  To
     the side of it is a large bump, presumably the head.  The two pieces of
     cadaver are slid onto the gurney and wheeled under the lights.  A
     stainless steel bucket is placed under the gurney's outlet pipe.  Dr.
     Ziewzic fiddles with a microphone hanging above the body, she taps it
     and it gives off the proper static.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                        (for the microphone)
                    This is Dr. Matilda Ziewzic,
                    assisted by Dr. Frederick Gross.
                    It's Oct. 28, six fifteen p.m.  We
                    are joined by Lieutenant Vincent
                    D'Agosta of the NYPD, Special Agent
                    Pendergast of the FBI and a police
                    photographer.  Let's see what we've
                    got.

     They pull off the sheet and D'AGOSTA swallows hard, closes his eyes to
     keep his stomach in check.  The photographer goes green, but is
     determined not to clutch this time.  PENDERGAST leans closer, totally
     impassive.  He puts on a small pair of wire rim glasses, assumes an
     expression much like a man reading a menu in a restaurant.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    Caucasian male.  Age about 27.  Blond.
                    Height well I can't give a height
                    because Mr. Beauregard has been
                    decapitated.  The state of the body
                    is such that other identifying marks
                    are out of the question.  There are
                    numerous lacerations proceeding from
                    the left anterior pectoral downwards
                    through the sternum and terminating
                    in the abdomen.  This is a massive
                    wound, two feet long and a foot
                    wide.  The head has suffered severe
                    trauma and the occipital portion of
                    the calavarium has been crushed and
                    removed.  It almost looks like... 

                              DR. GROSS
                        (beat)
                    A bite.

     Ziewzic turns to Pendergast.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    What are we talking about here?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Someone who makes the Hacksaw
                    Murderer look like Mother Teresa.

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    Right.
                        (back to work)
                    The entire brain appears to have
                    been extracted.  May I see it,
                    please?

     Gross passes over a grey, watery mass that sits in a stainless steel
     pan.  Ziewzic studies Beauregard's brain, or what's left of it... 

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                    Curious.  There's something missing.

                              PENDERGAST
                    The thalamus and the hypothalamus,
                    perhaps?

                              DR. ZIEWZIC
                        (looks up, surprised)
                    Yes.  Two organs the size of a walnut
                    have been removed with what looks
                    like surgical precision.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What happened to them?

                              PENDERGAST
                    If you don't mind a suggestion, you
                    might try a saliva test.

     Ziewzic, Gross and D'Agosta look at Pendergast.  The photographer is
     staring at the wall, silently mouthing multiplication tables to keep
     from woofing all over the place.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (incredulous)
                    Saliva test?  You mean, you think
                    someone ate part of the brain?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Correct.

     A long moment of silence, then... Zwiezic uses a swab for the saliva
     test, puts the result in a petrie dish.

                              DR. ZWIEZIC
                    Okay.  One saliva test.  Now... let's
                    look at these lacerations.  They
                    start wide and then converge.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Long fingernails?  Scratches?

                              DR. ZWIEZIC
                    Too extreme.  Perhaps some kind of
                    weapon.  I'm now probing the wound
                    and... there's a piece of foreign
                    material deep in the muscle, lodged
                    on a rib.  Photograph.

     The photographer gathers his courage, steps forward with D'Agosta and
     Pendergast.  Zwiezic rinses the object off in a beaker of sterile
     water.  It turns brownish red.  She holds it up.  They all stare in
     astonished silence.  D'Agosta swallows.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Sweet Jesus.

                              DR. ZWIEZIC
                    It's a claw.

     The photographer's flash goes off.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

     A black and white heads uptown.

     INT. COP CAR - NIGHT

     Pendergast sits in silence.  D'Agosta is visibly disturbed.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I don't like animals.  Never have.
                    Dog bit me when I was little.  After
                    that I gave up on pets.  Animals are
                    irrational.  Give me a psychotic
                    killer any day.  If there's one thing
                    that makes me queasy it's being part
                    of a food chain.  My first case as a
                    rookie, two brothers climbed a fence
                    at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over
                    ninety.  The polar bear was inside
                    his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in
                    there.  All they saw was the pool.
                    They got to swimming and splashing.
                    The noise woke up the bear.  By the
                    time I arrived, both little boys
                    were in pieces.  The bear was
                    dragging one kid around by the foot.
                    I can still hear the mother
                    screaming --

                              PENDERGAST
                    This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've
                    been on this case four months,
                    remember?  I've learned a few things.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    You've been holding out on me
                    Pendergast.  You have a suspect
                    capable of this?

     Pendergast looks over, nods quietly.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Let me tell you about it, Vince.

     EXT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DUSK

     The yellow crime scene tape is torn and flapping in a light rain.  Most
     of the emergency vehicles have left.  The police have released the
     employees who are now headed home.  We see Frock and Kawakita exit.
     Cuthbert isn't far behind.  Pendergast approaches them, headed back
     inside.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Excuse me.  Has Dr. Green left?

                              KAWAKITA
                    Before eight?  You must be joking.
                    She's in the physical anthro lab
                    making up for lost time.

     Pendergast nods his thanks.

     INT. MUSEUM HALL OF THE GEMS - NIGHT

     The gems glow in the darkness as Pendergast passes through the now
     empty room.

     INT. METEORITE ROOM - NIGHT

     Pendergast's footfalls are lost in the carpet as he goes down the far
     stairs.

     INT. HALLWAY - MUSEUM - NIGHT

     Pendergast goes down a long, dark hall alone.  He arrives at a door
     marked PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB, enters.

     INT. PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB - NIGHT

     The skeletons throw odd shadows on the ceiling.  Margo's computer
     screen glows at the end of the room, casting the only light.  But her
     chair is empty.  The room is quiet.  Pendergast approaches slowly, looks
     around.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Dr. Green?

     No answer.  Pendergast glances at the computer screen, sees graphs and
     complicated notations.  He scrolls down, leans closer.  He can't figure
     it out.  He slides into Margo's chair, fascinated.  Then... 

                              MARGO (OS)
                    You have a warrant to look at that?

     Pendergast leaps up.  Margo has appeared in the doorway behind him, a
     cup of coffee in her hand.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
                    Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping.
                    What is this?

                              MARGO
                    An invention of mine.  It's a
                    computer program designed to
                    describe the characteristics of a
                    given species from a reading of its
                    DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence
                    Extrapolator.

                              PENDERGAST
                    How does it work?

                              MARGO
                    With a DNA analysis from a fossil
                    you can use this program to tell the
                    species and sex of the animal,
                    whether it was nocturnal, what it
                    ate, how it hunted, how big it
                    was... 
                        (abrupt)
                    You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.

                              PENDERGAST
                    No.
                        (a moment)
                    I came to talk about Dr. John
                    Whittlesley.

     Margo turns to put down her coffee.  She takes a moment to compose
     herself.  When she turns back, her voice is quiet.

                              MARGO
                    Somehow, when all this happened... I
                    knew it would come back to John.  Is
                    he really dead?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Maybe not.

                              MARGO
                    If he were alive he'd have contacted
                    me.

                              PENDERGAST
                    You have time to talk?

     INT. MUSEUM HALLS - NIGHT

     Pendergast and Margo walk together though various exhibits and halls.
     They pass dioramas of ferocious wild animals that have been tamed and
     stuffed behind glass.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in
                    Belem, Venezuela a week after the
                    rest of his expedition disappeared.
                    A taxi driver drove him to the
                    harbor where he boarded a cargo
                    boat.  That boat washed up in my
                    district.  Everyone on board was
                    killed.

                              MARGO
                    And John?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Disappeared.  His body wasn't among
                    the victims.

                              MARGO
                    I don't understand.

                              PENDERGAST
                    The people killed were mauled and
                    their brains were eaten.  Just like
                    Beauregard.  One part of the brain
                    was extracted with surgical
                    precision.  The hypothalamus and
                    thalamus to be exact.

     Margo pales.

                              MARGO
                    John couldn't have anything to do
                    with a horrible thing like that.  He
                    was a fine man despite his
                    problems --

                              PENDERGAST
                    You loved him.

                              MARGO
                        (a moment, taken aback)
                    Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John
                    held the Cadwalader Chair in
                    Statistical Paleontology when I was
                    a grad student there.

                              PENDERGAST
                    You were going to be married.

                              MARGO
                    How did you know that?

                              PENDERGAST
                    I ran an internet search on Dr.
                    Whittlesley.  Got a list of his
                    scholarly articles and the
                    engagement announcement in the
                    Times.  I also found a record of your
                    restraining order.

                              MARGO
                    That was two years ago.  John was
                    still in love with me.
                        (she looks down)
                    He wouldn't leave me alone.

                              PENDERGAST
                    You were afraid of him, weren't you?

                              MARGO
                    He was afraid of himself.  He tried
                    suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic
                    depressive.  He had wild emotional
                    highs and lows.  Not a happy
                    affliction for a scientist.  He'd
                    been revered in our community.  By
                    the end he was a joke.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Tell me about the last expedition.
                    What was he looking for?

                              MARGO
                    A legendary monster called Mbwun.

                              PENDERGAST
                    A monster?

                              MARGO
                    Yes.  He developed his own theory
                    that he called the Calisto Effect.
                    It held that evolution wasn't always
                    gradual or driven by natural
                    selection.  The environment would
                    sometimes cause sudden and grotesque
                    changes which could result in a
                    "monster species".  It made no sense.
                    But he felt he had evidence that
                    Mbwun was such a monster, living in
                    isolation on the tepui for thousands
                    of years.

                              PENDERGAST
                    What happened?

                              MARGO
                    No one knows.  The Kothoga who live
                    on the tepui are cannibals.

     Margo's voice catches again.  Pendergast reaches for his handkerchief
     but she shakes her head, determined to keep control.

                              MARGO
                    No.  I'm all right.  I won't let this
                    affect me anymore.  John wouldn't get
                    help.  His ego endangered the lives
                    of others.  His theory came first.

                              PENDERGAST
                    What if Whittlesley arrived on the
                    tepui and no monster was there?  Was
                    he desperate enough to create one?

                              MARGO
                    I don't understand.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Something came up in autopsy
                    tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's
                    body we found a claw.

                              MARGO
                    My God.  Then it was an animal.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I don't think so.  I think we were
                    meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did
                    Whittlesley's monster have claws?

                              MARGO
                    I don't know.  He sent back a statue
                    that's supposed to be an exact
                    representation.  But I've never seen
                    it.  It's in the exhibit.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Would you mind showing it to me?

     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT

     This exhibit is unlike anything we've seen in the museum.  Horrifying
     artifacts under single spots appear to float in a velvet blackness.
     Patterns of light and shadow play over skeletons and voodoo dolls.
     There are tombs, a torture chamber, and endlessly curving, maze-like,
     winding halls.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Where would we find it?

                              MARGO
                    I'm not sure.  We should split up.
                    You take that hall and I'll take
                    this one.

                              PENDERGAST
                    All right.  I'm as macho as you are.
                    Perhaps.

     Without further discussion, Margo takes the right fork leaving
     Pendergast behind.

     ON MARGO... 

     As she finds herself alone.  The silence is intense.  She heads slowly
     into another long, dark, tunnel passing a set of Maori tattooed heads.
     The eyes are stuffed with fibers, the shriveled lips are drawn back
     from rotting teeth.  Margo passes without a look.

     ON PENDERGAST

     In another part of the exhibit, he nears a Mayan tomb.  A skeleton in
     the center wears a headdress and tribal robes.  Gold rings encircle
     bony fingers.  Pendergast takes a moment to appreciate it, heads into
     the next hall.

     ON MARGO

     getting farther from pendergast, and ever deeper into the gloom.  The
     walls around her are lined with symbols of witchcraft.  There are
     shaman dancers, masks covered in grasses and shells.  From the New
     Guinea coast there is Kokpah, God of a secret male society, and Zoe-
     ba, an awesome mannequin in black costume with an angry pointed mask.

     Finally the walls open up into another gallery.  Beyond it is more of
     the shadowy hall.  Margo stops and for the first time she wavers.  This
     gallery is the most frightening yet.  It features images of THE DEVIL
     from different cultures around the world.

     In the dim light, Margo is dwarfed by abhorrent statues of SATAN,
     TORNARSUK (the Eskimo evil spirit), INCUBI from India, Tibet, New
     Guinea etc.  And there in the center of the gallery sitting on an altar
     and lit by a spot, is a small figurine.  Margo is instantly drawn to
     it.  As she gets close enough she sees the label in Gothic letters.

                              MBWUN

                    Savage God of the Kothoga, also
                    known as "HE WHO WALKS ON ALL
                    FOURS".

     The statue is terrifyingly life-like.  Margo stares at The Beast.  Mbwun
     is covered in scales and stiff hair, with glittering green eyes and
     crude, reptilian features.  The figure is hunched over in a threatening
     crouch.  It's long forearms trail to the ground ending in THREE LARGE
     CLAWS!

     ON MARGO... she starts, then remembers Pendergast.

                              MARGO
                    Mr. Pendergast!  I found it.

     No answer.  She turns, tries again, louder.

                              MARGO
                    Pendergast!  Over here --

     Her voice catches as she stops and sniffs the air.  A STENCH rolls over
     her.  She covers her face, backs up, holding her breath.

                              MARGO
                    What the... 

     She steps directly into a nasty statue of the Tibetan lord of the
     Dead.  Margo starts, steadies the statue.  The room is silent once more.
     But then, unmistakably... she hears it.  An odd rustling sound.  Slow.
     Deliberate.  Maddeningly soft on the thick carpet.  And another wave of
     THE SMELL.  Margo looks in the direction she came, down the long dark
     hall.  Her voice comes out a bit frightened as she calls... 

                              MARGO
                    Pendergast?
                        (no answer)
                    Who's there?

     But now she freezes.  At last she's truly scared.  A shadow, black
     against black, is gliding stealthily towards her, moving over the
     display cases and grinning artifacts!

     Margo stands stock still, her eyes on the shadow.  She lets out a small
     gasp of shock.  She can't believe her eyes.  It defies reason.  Slowly,
     she backs up.  She slips quietly through the exhibit and out the other
     side.  In the next room she pauses again, listens... now hearing a
     distinctly animal, SNUFFLING SOUND!

     Something large is TRACKING HER!  There's no doubt.

     Overcome by a blind panic, Margo turns and runs.  She passes through a
     display on mythical creatures, disappears down another winding dark
     hall.

     Behind her comes... 

     THE POUNDING OF SOMETHING IN A HEAVY, LOPING RUN!  Whatever it is, it's
     charging after her!  She turns another corner.  And another, tearing as
     fast as she can!  But now the walls up ahead are narrowing, leading to
     ... a DEAD END!

     Margo slams up against a locked door with a window of glass.  The hall
     features displays of terrifying totem poles.  All around the ghoulish
     carved faces seem to leap out!  She pounds on the door but it's
     useless.  She's trapped.  And the thing is coming behind her!  It's just
     around the last bend when it stops!  Silence again envelops her.  She's
     afraid to turn.  She can hear HEAVY BREATHING, and something like a low
     growl!  Reflected in the glass of the door in front of her is the long
     dark hall.  Margo starts as a face appears IN THE REFLECTION... 

     The image is wavering and unclear.  It's a large, hulking form behind
     her!  TWO GLOWING SLIT GREEN EYES in the dark!  Margo SCREAMS as the
     thing leaps forward, hitting one of the totem poles.  Margo sinks to
     the ground, unconscious.  At last we hear Pendergast calling as
     darkness falls.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Dr. Green!  Dr. Green!

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT

     ON MARGO... lying on the carpet.  There's a large, nasty bump on her
     forehead.  The totem pole is on the floor beside her.  Leaning over her
     is PENDERGAST.  Margo starts to sit up.  Pendergast gently restrains
     her.

                              PENDERGAST
                    What happened?

                              MARGO
                    I don't know.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I heard you calling and I ran after
                    you, but you kept disappearing and I
                    couldn't keep up.

                              MARGO
                        (she touches her forehead)
                    You were behind me?  Running after
                    me?

     Pendergast nods.  As Margo rises he tries to help her but she waves him
     off, collecting her thoughts.

                              MARGO
                    It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember
                    now... It was an animal.  Something
                    large!  I could smell it.  It was
                    hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in
                    the dark.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Where did you see it?

                              MARGO
                    Behind me.  Over there.

     Margo turns and points behind her to... 

     A large NORTHWEST COAST INDIAN MASK.  It's carved out of wood in a
     horrible grimace, inset with two glowing green eyes.  Pendergast sees
     it too, says nothing.

                              MARGO
                    That's not what I saw.

                              PENDERGAST
                    All right.  If you're positive.

     She leans against the wall, touches her forehead, panic overcoming her
     again.

                              MARGO (CON'T)
                    I can't think straight at the
                    moment.  I know how crazy this seems.
                    Please, Mr. Pendergast, I need some
                    fresh air.  Could you get me out of
                    here?

     EXT. ROTUNDA FRONT ENTRY - EXHIBIT - NIGHT

     THREE COPS including MCNITT, RODRIGUEZ and ROGERS prepare to enter the
     exhibit.  All are armed.  Margo watches as Pendergast gives them
     instruction.  She appears rattled and confused.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Stay in formation together.  Take it
                    room by room.  Check for footprints,
                    any signs of disturbance.  If you see
                    or hear anything the least bit
                    suspicious, I want to know.

     He points to DOYLE, an older red-haired cop who takes up a post
     outside the exhibit.  Pendergast hands Doyle his walkie talkie.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Bailey's going to be in the guard
                    house outside.  Officer Van Dorn is
                    right down that hall.  When McNitt's
                    done, he'll relieve you.

     Doyle nods.  Pendergast and Margo walk out.

     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

     Margo and Pendergast exit.  The cold air is like a slap in the face.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Dr. Green... 

                              MARGO
                    I didn't imagine it.  I know what I
                    saw.  Are you sure there are enough
                    men in there?

                              PENDERGAST
                    They're all heavily armed.

                              MARGO
                        (stops)
                    All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm
                    a scientist.  I like order and logic.
                    Sometimes too much.  There's got to
                    be an explanation.  There can't be an
                    animal in there.  But I saw
                    something.

                              PENDERGAST
                    What was it?

                              MARGO
                    I don't know.
                        (she has a thought)
                    Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get
                    me a DNA readout on that claw.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

     All is quiet.

     INT. MUSEUM FRONT - EXHIBIT FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

     The doors to the exhibit are closed.  Doyle looks at his watch,
     impatient.  It's almost eleven now.  He pulls out his walkie talkie.

                              DOYLE
                    Bailey?  Doyle here.  I'm still
                    waiting outside the exhibit.  Where
                    the hell is McNitt?

                              BAILEY
                    Should be there any minute.  They
                    came out a side door a while ago.
                    Said the exhibit's clear.  McNitt's
                    headed back to spell you.

                              DOYLE
                    I'm on double over-time, man.

                              BAILEY
                    I know.  You can go home if you want
                    to.  I'll come relieve you myself.

     Doyle shuts off his walkie talkie, frowns.  He fidgets, looks at his
     watch once more.

                              DOYLE
                    What the hell.

     He turns, takes off the walkie talkie and leaves it, but then he hears
     something, stops.  It's a low SCUFFLING from inside the exhibit, coming
     from behind the closed doors.  Doyle freezes, turns.

                              DOYLE
                    McNitt?

     No answer.  Doyle pauses.  His hand goes to his gun for reassurance as
     he hears a footstep and a muffled thump.  He moves to the door of the
     exhibit, opens it and takes a step inside.

                              DOYLE
                    McNitt?  Cut the crap.  I know it's
                    you.  You're not scaring me.  Come on.

     Silence meets him.  The shadows of the exhibit loom.  Doyle takes one
     more step inside, scanning the darkness with his gun.  Does he hear
     BREATHING?  He freezes.  Yes, he does.  The hair on his neck rises and he
     loses the spit in his mouth.  He takes a step backwards, but he's half
     a second too late.  The door SLAMS BEHIND HIM and a HUGE DARK FORM
     LEAPS OUT!

     INT. EXHIBIT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

     Officer MCNITT enters from a side corridor, zipping up his fly.  The
     hall is still.  McNitt checks his watch, sees Doyle's walkie talkie and
     turns it on.

                              MCNITT
                    McNitt here.  I'm outside the
                    exhibit.  All's quiet.  But I don't
                    see Doyle.

                              BAILEY (OS)
                    He called a minute ago looking for
                    you.  He starts vacation tomorrow and
                    he wanted out.  I said you were on
                    the way.  He could split.

                              MCNITT
                    Well he's gone.

                              BAILEY (OS)
                    Any sign of a green-eyed monster?

                              MCNITT
                        (chuckles)
                    Nope.

     McNitt shuts off the walkie talkie, settles at his post.

     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT

     In the blackness a large shape is MOVING QUIETLY, dragging it's prey
     across the floor.  We move in on the lifeless form of DOYLE.  His face
     is rigid with terror, his eyes frozen, open wide.  The last thing we
     hear as the hulking form heads back into the darkness, is the SNAPPING
     of Doyle's skull.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. MUSEUM - DAY

     Signs announce that the Superstition Exhibit opens tonight.  The museum
     is back in business, but not many people are going in.  A crowd lingers
     at the margins, pointing at the building.  Several hold a copy of the
     POST with a graphic photo of the bloody floor by the circular stair.

     INT. CUTHBERT'S OFFICE - DAY

     Cuthbert stands by the window of his palatial office, looking out at
     the scene below.  His face is pinched with worry.  Slumped in a chair is
     Lieutenant D'Agosta.  Pendergast surveys some paintings on the wall.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I had no idea the Museum had a
                    complete collection of Piranesi's
                    Forum sketches.

                              CUTHBERT
                    If you like them, they're for sale.
                    Another day like yesterday and half
                    the collection will be on the block.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I've read about the Museum's
                    financial troubles.

                              CUTHBERT
                    We've been operating in the red for
                    years.  That was the whole idea
                    behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It
                    was designed to pull people in.
                    We've spent every penny we have on
                    advance publicity, betting
                    everything on the opening's success.
                    If we postpone at the last minute... 
                    No.  I don't want to think about
                    that.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (chews on his toothpick, mild)
                    We all love the museum.  I come here
                    myself with my kids.  We're trying to
                    work with you.

                              CUTHBERT
                    I appreciate that.

                              PENDERGAST
                    If the party goes forward, and
                    that's a big if... I've arranged for
                    a large police presence.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Do they have to wear uniforms?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Yes.

                              CUTHBERT
                    I don't want to scare people.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert,
                    we've got bigger problems.  Depending
                    on what we find today, we may have
                    to shut you down.

     Cuthbert looks grim.

     INT. PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB - DAY

     D'Agosta examines the huge centrifuges, autoclaves, electrophoresis
     apparati, monitors, computers etc.  as Margo and Greg Kawakita look at
     the claw.

                              KAWAKITA
                    What do you make of it, Margo?

                              MARGO
                    It's not mammalian, that's for sure.
                    I think it's reptilian.

                              PENDERGAST
                    That would jive with what we got
                    from the preliminary DNA read-out.
                    Here, have a look.

     He hands them a computer read-out.  Margo checks it quickly as Kawakita
     looks on.

                              MARGO
                    According to this, twenty-five
                    percent of the claw DNA is
                    unidentifiable, about a third is
                    homo sapien, and the rest is
                    Hemidactylus Turcicus.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (looks over)
                    What's that?

     Margo pulls off her glasses.

                              MARGO
                    Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same
                    strand?  Impossible.  The sample must
                    be contaminated.

                              MARGO
                    There's another possibility.  A lot
                    of repeated base pairs could suggest
                    a high level of genetic damage.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Genetic damage?

                              MARGO
                    When DNA is defective, it often
                    uncontrollably replicates long
                    repeating sequences of the same base
                    pair.  Viruses can damage DNA.  So can
                    radiation, certain chemicals.  Even
                    cancer.  Let's let the G.S.E. sort it
                    out.  I have to get started.  This
                    will take several hours.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We need someone to take us to the
                    secure storage area.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Try Dr. Frock.  He's the curator of
                    Plant Biology.  All the curators
                    have keys.  And he knows every inch
                    of this museum.  The rest of us still
                    get lost.

     INT. MUSEUM HALLWAY AREA - DAY

     Pendergast, D'Agosta and Dr. Frock get off are in an older, plain
     corridor with a long row of locked heavy steel doors.  The doors are
     numbered up to eight, then the corridor turns.

     As the three go forward, the creaking of the wheelchair echoes faintly
     in the hall.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Thank you for taking the time to
                    help us with this, Dr. Frock.

                              FROCK
                    Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough
                    these days.  According to security,
                    Beauregard put the Whittlesley
                    crates in storage area 1012.

                              PENDERGAST
                    How many storage areas are there?

                              FROCK
                    They fill seven floors.  We have the
                    largest collection of mammals and
                    dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give
                    you an idea, there are more than
                    three million insects specimens.  Not
                    to mention amphibians, reptiles,
                    birds, anthropological artifacts,
                    meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only
                    about five percent of the museum
                    collection is actually on display.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    This place is a maze.

                              FROCK
                    I'm one of the few who know every
                    inch it, now that John is gone.

                              PENDERGAST
                        (looks over)
                    Do you mean Dr. Whittlesley?

                              FROCK
                    Yes.  John made quite a study of the
                    whole museum.  He had a copy of my
                    original plans.

     Frock heads through a double door that leads to a FREIGHT ELEVATOR
     that's as big as a small room.  The operator, KARL has it decorated
     with a table, chair, and PICTURES.

                              MARGO
                    Osteo prep, Karl.

     The doors creak closed.  They are now inside... 

     INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY

     Headed down.  D'Agosta chews on a toothpick, stares at Karl's home-made
     picture show.  The photos have all been cut from nature magazines.  They
     are of ANIMALS MATING in extreme positions and undreamed of ways.
     D'Agosta turns to Pendergast, dead pan.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    My kind of art.

     Karl, who is sixty and wears a red toupee, leers.

                              KARL
                    They keep me company.  Gets kinda
                    lonely sometimes.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    My favorite is the two camels.

                              KARL
                    Really?  I'm partial to the skunks.

     Finally the doors open and they exit to a hail, enter another set of
     doors.  Now they are in

     INT. OSTEOLOGICAL PREPARATION AREA - DAY

     It looks more like a bizarre industrial kitchen than anything else.
     Deep stainless steel tanks line one wall.  On the ceiling near the
     tanks hang massive pulleys and grappling hooks for the larger
     carcasses.  In a far corner of the workshop is a stainless-steel gurney
     bearing a DEAD GORILLA.  A pink faced eighty year old man is working on
     the carcass with sharp tools.  This is DON OSTERBAAN.

                              FROCK
                    Did you ever wonder where we get all
                    our skeletons?  This is the
                    laboratory where animal carcasses
                    are reduced to bones.
                        (to Osterbaan)
                    What's cooking today, Don?

                              DON
                    Zebra.

     Frock looks into a large maceration tank with Pendergast and D'Agosta.
     A zebra carcass can be seen under the muddy surface, its flesh and
     soft tissues falling off.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Man, that's ripe.

     Frock now opens the door on a humid closet adjacent to the main room.
     Inside on a stainless steel table lies the corpse of a fox.  It's
     crawling with BLACK BEETLES which are devouring it.  D'Agosta and
     Pendergast watch the grizzly scene, properly impressed.

                              FROCK
                    Dermestid beetles.  The second method
                    of preparing a skeleton, used in
                    Natural History Museums world wide.
                    Bugs are clean and highly efficient.
                    They'll polish that fox off in no
                    time.

     As Don casually peels back the gorilla's whole face exposing the
     skull... 

                              OSTERBAAN
                    Want to have a look at a gorilla
                    brain?  Got one right here.

                              FROCK
                    Thanks Don.  We're in a hurry.  Some
                    other time.

     INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     More rows of stainless steel doors under hissing steam pipes.  The
     light is dim here, and several bulbs are burned out.  But the numbers
     on the storage rooms are much higher now.  The three men come out of
     the darkness.  Frock rounds a last corner and wheels to a stop.

                              FROCK
                    This should be it.  Can you read the
                    number?

     Pendergast reaches up above them and TAPS THE LIGHT BULB.  It comes on
     and they all see the heavy steel door of the storage area.  D'Agosta's
     jaw drops and his toothpick falls out.  The door has been scored from
     top to bottom by long, vicious, CLAWS!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Holy shit.

     Frock stares in amazement, shaken.  He runs a finger down the deep
     ruts.

                              FROCK
                    Something tried to get into this
                    room!

                              PENDERGAST
                    And failed.  These doors are solid
                    steel.

                              FROCK
                    This means there must be an animal
                    loose in the museum!

                              PENDERGAST
                    I wouldn't be so sure.

     Pendergast takes Frock's keys and opens the door.  It swings wide on
     oiled hinges.  D'Agosta turns on a light.

     INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

     They all enter.  Nothing has been disturbed.  The crates sit in the
     middle of the small room, untouched.  Pendergast kneels by the only one
     that's been opened.

                              PENDERGAST
                    This must be the one that held the
                    statue.  Let's see what else is
                    inside.

     Pendergast removes the lid and hands it to D'Agosta, pulls out a BLOW
     DART GUN, SEED PODS, a CARVED STONE.  D'Agosta takes the lid and turns
     it.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    The lid of this crate is scratched
                    with claw marks, just like the door.

     As D'Agosta studies the lid, a brittle, water damaged envelope slips
     out.  D'Agosta picks it up.  The envelope bears an imprint of TWO
     ARROWS, one silver overlaid with another of GOLD.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Look.  It's some kind of letter.

                              FROCK
                        (excited)
                    May I see that?

     D'Agosta hands the letter to Frock.

                              FROCK
                    It's from John.  Those two arrows
                    were his insignia.  It's addressed to
                    Louis Moriarty, a patron who
                    financed his expeditions.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Read it out loud.

                              FROCK
                    "Dear Louis,
                    	Tomorrow we go to the south
                    end of the tepui where we'll be in
                    the greatest danger, so I'm sending
                    Carlos back with the crates.  You
                    always believed in me, Louis, even
                    in the darkest days.  So it gives me
                    great pleasure to tell you your
                    faith has been rewarded.  We've made
                    an incredible find.  I enclose a
                    representation of Mbwun.  Note the
                    exaggerated claws, the reptilian
                    attributes, the hints of bipedalia.
                    It's beyond belief, but this statue
                    is accurate.  I know because I've
                    seen the beast."

     Frock stops, looks up at D'Agosta and Pendergast.  His face flushes
     with the thrill.

                              FROCK
                    Did you hear that?  My God.  He says
                    that Mbwun is real!

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (snorts)
                    Pardon my French, but bull shit.

                              FROCK
                    This on top of the scratches... isn't
                    it proof!

                              PENDERGAST
                    I think the scratches were put there
                    to scare us.  Perhaps even lead us to
                    this note.

     Pendergast looks out to the dark corridors.

                              PENDERGAST
                    You said John Whittlesley made a
                    study of your blueprints of the
                    museum.

                              FROCK
                    Yes.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Are there any hidden rooms or
                    staircases?  Places where someone
                    could hide?

                              FROCK
                    Not really.  Just the sub-basement.

     D'Agosta and Pendergast exchange a look.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Where is that?

                              FROCK
                    I don't know.  It was walled over.  No
                    one's been down there in years.

                              PENDERGAST
                    You said you had plans of the
                    museum.  Could we see them, please?

     EXT. MUSEUM SIDE DOOR - DAY

     A series of boxes labeled "PROFESSOR FROCK" sit on the loading dock.  A
     small moving van, partially loaded with the contents of Frock's
     office, sits waiting.  Frock delves through one of the boxes while
     Pendergast and D'Agosta look on.

                              FROCK
                    I know they're here somewhere.  It's
                    a good thing we caught the movers in
                    time.  They're nineteen century
                    blueprints from when the museum was
                    built.  I remember the sub-basement
                    was below the regular basement,
                    linked to the city sewer.  I only
                    know about it because it flooded all
                    the way up to the museum during the
                    hurricane of '49.  I lost so many
                    precious books.

     Frock continues to unload boxes, scattering things right and left.
     It's the most amazing assortment of paraphernalia.  A collection of
     wildflowers, soil samples, a stuffed owl.  Finally he pulls out some
     very old blueprints and flashes a triumphant smile.

                              FROCK
                    Eureka.  Who says it doesn't pay to
                    be a pack rat?  Now please be careful
                    with these.  When you're done, I'd
                    like them back.

     INT. HALL OF THE AFRICAN MAMMALS - DAY

     Visitors scatter as Pendergast enters with D'Agosta, TWO DEPUTIES, a
     dog handler, JONATHAN HAMM and Jonathan's pair of HUGE BLOODHOUNDS.
     The deputies are armed with large shotguns.  Pendergast scans the
     blueprints as they walk.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    How big is the sub-basement?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Apparently it's huge.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I think I should come with you.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We haven't got time.  You have to
                    meet with museum security so we can
                    make a decision about tonight.

     INT. MUSEUM - STAIRCASE - DAY

     Pendergast, Jonathan, his dogs and the deputies make their way down an
     industrial set of stairs into the basement.

     INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

     In a moment they arrive at the site of Beauregard's murder.  The area
     at the bottom of the spiral stairway is still littered with chalk,
     crime tape, spray paint and the remains of scores of people tramping
     in and out.

                              PENDERGAST
                    These plans indicate there's a
                    walled over entrance to the sub-
                    basement right around here.

     They move carefully down the dark corridor which we remember from the
     time we last saw it with Henry and Larry.  Unknown to Jonathan or
     Pendergast, the dogs are walking directly towards the spot where the
     boys faced the monster.

                              JONATHAN
                    The dogs are picking up something,
                    Mr. Pendergast.

     The dogs start barking in animation, sniffing the wall.  Pendergast
     studies the blueprints with a flashlight, moves to the spot.  There's
     nothing to be seen.  He shines his flashlight over the water-stained,
     uneven stucco between two steel beams.  The dogs sniff furiously at the
     point where the wall meets the floor.  Pendergast moves his fingers to
     the joint between the stucco and the beam, shoves hard.  The wall
     pushes back.  It's a door!

     INT. STAIRWELL - SUB-BASEMENT - DAY

     They enter a dank stairwell with brick stairs.  Water drips on the
     walls.

                              DEPUTY ONE
                    What is this?  A dungeon?

     Jonathan looks uneasy, double wraps the dogs' leashes around his
     black-gloved hands.  The two deputies remove their 12 gauges from their
     shoulders.  Then they all follow the animals, descend down the inky
     stairwell.

     INT. SECURITY COMMAND CENTER - MUSEUM - DAY

     The place looks like the control room of a nuclear power plant.  Two
     SECURITY GUARDS monitor a battery of closed-circuit screens.  D'Agosta
     is now accompanied by the pompous head of security, IPPOLITO.  Clearly
     Ippolito feels D'Agosta is pissing on his territory and he's trying to
     assert control.

                              IPPOLITO
                    This huge police presence tonight
                    isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll
                    just scare people off.  I can handle
                    the security behind scenes with this
                    system.  It's state of the art.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    The cops are non-negotiable,
                    Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me
                    how this space station works.

                              IPPOLITO
                    It's fool proof, basically.  I
                    designed this whole thing myself.
                    Every valuable object in the Museum
                    carries a small electronic chip.  If
                    anything's moved so much as an inch,
                    we get an alarm pinpointing the
                    exact location of the attempted
                    theft.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    That's great if you're stopping a
                    burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are
                    there motion detectors?

                              IPPOLITO
                    In every exhibition room.  The
                    museum's divided into five cells.
                    The reception and exhibit are in
                    cell five.  We could arm the motion
                    detectors in cells one to four, then
                    seal the perimeter with our fire
                    doors.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    That would leave one exit for
                    hundreds of people.  You'd be
                    violating every fire regulation on
                    the books.  We'll guard the perimeter
                    with my men and engage the motion
                    detectors in the other cells.  One
                    more question.  I see a big hole.  If
                    this entire thing is run by
                    computer, what happens if the power
                    fails?

                              IPPOLITO
                        (snorts)
                    You don't know much about computers,
                    Lieutenant.  There are safeguards
                    built in.  We have back-up systems
                    with redundancies.  There's no way

     INT. PHYSICAL ANTHRO LAB - DAY

     Margo, Kawakita and Frock are studying the contents of the crate.

                              FROCK
                    I can't help thinking there's
                    something that Pendergast
                    overlooked.  If the scratches were
                    made by whatever killed Beauregard,
                    it wants something that's in here.

                              MARGO
                    A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant
                    press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.

                              FROCK
                    Let me see the plant press.

     Frock opens the plant press and sees a specimen inside.

                              MARGO
                    What is it?

                              FROCK
                    I'm not sure.  As you know, the
                    Kothoga lived outside civilization
                    on the tepui for thousands of years.
                    Species flourished in isolation when
                    man and pollution rendered them
                    extinct.  This could be one of the
                    last remaining samples of an unknown
                    plant.

                              MARGO
                    Whatever it is, it must be common on
                    the tepui.  John used it as packing
                    material.

                              FROCK
                    You're right.

     Kawakita lifts out a bit of the fibers, as does Frock.

                              FROCK
                    They're curiously fleshy.

                              KAWAKITA
                    And they smell delicious.

     Kawakita TAKES a NIBBLE.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Taste great.

                              FROCK
                    I wouldn't put that in your mouth
                    until we do a chemical analysis,
                    Greg.

                              KAWAKITA
                    I can handle that for you while
                    we're waiting on the G.S.E.

     Kawakita rises and exits with some of the plant.

                              MARGO
                    What about those seed pods?  Are they
                    from the same plant?

     Frock takes a moment to study them, looks up.

                              FROCK
                    Margo, these aren't seed pods.

                              MARGO
                    What are they?

                              FROCK
                    They're eggs.

     INT. SUB-BASEMENT - DAY

     Black as night.  The only light comes from the men's flashlights.
     They're at a crossroads.  Crooked corridors, with arched ceilings
     barely the height of a man stretch in several directions.  Jonathan is
     crouched down, resting with the panting dogs.  The deputies are having
     a smoke.  They all look both uneasy and exhausted except for
     Pendergast.  He stares at the blueprints.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Hard to read in this light.  The ink
                    is so faded.

                              JONATHAN
                    The dogs have lost the scent, Mr.
                    Pendergast.  Maybe we should head
                    back.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the
                    left.

     The men reluctantly shoulder their shotguns and push on.  The hounds
     walk ahead, carelessly nosing the ground.  The flashlight beams
     illuminate lime-encrusted, cave-like walls.

                              DEPUTY TWO
                    This place gives me the creeps.

     At this the dogs begin to WHINE.  The HAIR on their backs rises in a
     ridge.  Pendergast turns as a BREEZE stirs his clothes.

                              JONATHAN
                    They've got something.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Keep the light up.  I can't see.

     The dogs strain and pull forward, sniffing the air ahead.  The deputies
     raise up their shotguns as they all move deeper into the darkness.  The
     flashlight beams streak crazily in all directions, barely penetrating
     the gloom.  Suddenly the dogs break into a terrifying BAYING which
     bounces off the walls.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Shut them up!

                              JONATHAN
                    Heel Argo!  Hobbes!  Heel!

     The dogs drag Jonathan forward, paying no attention, foaming at the
     mouth.  Jonathan is now frightened.

                              JONATHAN
                    They're going crazy!  I need help!

     Too late.  As Jonathan tries to grab the collars, one of the dogs LEAPS
     forward, and the leash slips through Jonathan's hands.

                              JONATHAN
                    He's loose!  Argo!

     Argo BOLTS into the darkness.  The men start after the dog, following
     the frantic barking which echoes farther and farther in the distance.
     Pendergast is in the lead.  Suddenly he throws out his arms, halts.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Stop!

                              JONATHAN
                    Holy mother, what is that?

     A goatish odor envelops them all.

                              DEPUTY ONE
                    Smells God-awful.  Like rotten meat.

                              JONATHAN
                    Argo!  Come!

                              PENDERGAST
                    Quiet!

     A SCUFFLING sound of claws dragging on brick is heard followed by a
     ROAR.  The men all freeze.  The other dog leaps and twists with
     excitement.  In the confusion it also breaks free!  It tears after the
     first dog, disappearing into the darkness.  Now Jonathan is wild-eyed.

                              JONATHAN
                    No!  Hobbes!

     The deputies are terrified, retreat.  The darkness is stifling,
     claustrophobic.  The flashlights are small help.  Pendergast alone
     remains dead calm.  His voice is cool and commanding.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Forget the dogs.  You two, get back
                    here.  Don't point that gun at me.

     The deputies regain control and follow Pendergast's orders.  They fall
     into position, pump their shotguns and aim them down the hall.  In the
     echoing darkness ahead of them, the barking falters and stops.

     There is a moment of silence, then a terrible, unearthly SHRIEK.  The
     deputies quail, frozen in their tracks.  Jonathan leaps forward.

                              JONATHAN
                    Argo!  Hobbes!

                              PENDERGAST
                    Get back!  Now!

     At that moment a SHAPE hurtles at them from the darkness!  The men YELL
     in terror.  There are two stunning BLASTS from the shotguns, two
     FLASHES of light accompanied by a deafening roar.  The rumble echoes
     and dies and there's an intense silence, followed by a sob.

                              JONATHAN
                    You shot my dog!

     Hobbes lies five feet from them, a black shadow of death.  Jonathan
     kneels by the dog, tears in his eyes.  Down the animals side is a GASH.

                              JONATHAN
                    My dog... 

                              DEPUTY ONE
                        (stammers)
                    He was coming right at me... 

     In the distance they can hear a terrified howl.  It's the second dog,
     hurt or frightened.  It's a pitiful sound.

                              DEPUTY TWO
                    Let's get out of here!

                              JONATHAN
                    I'm not going anywhere!  Not without
                    my dog!

     Pendergast grabs at Jonathan who slips from his grasp.  Jonathan inches
     back down the hallway calling desperately.

                              JONATHAN
                    Hobbes!

                              DEPUTY ONE
                    Get back!

     Jonathan shakes his head no.

                              JONATHAN
                    There's something out there!  Let's
                    go get it now!  That's why we came
                    down here, isn't it?

                              PENDERGAST
                        (to the deputies)
                    He's right.  Follow me.

     But the two deputies are terrified.  They cling to the wall, inching
     backwards, sheer horror in their eyes.

                              DEPUTY ONE
                    No way.  I say we get help.  A lot
                    more guns.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I'm ordering you!  Cover me!

                              DEPUTY TWO
                    We'll cover you from here!

     Jonathan is disappearing in front of them.  Pendergast has no choice.
     Grim faced, he pulls his Colt .45 Anaconda from a shoulder harness.
     It's a narrow and evil-looking gun.  From a pocket comes a handful of
     255 grain wadcutter and 147 grain FMJ flatnose ammunition.  He loads
     up, goes after Jonathan, who's no longer in sight.  Pendergast passes
     down a long, sloping hallway into cavernous blackness ahead.  At the
     bottom Pendergast stops.  He has to stoop down as he goes through an
     archway and into... 

     A VAST ARCHING ROOM... 

     A dark stream of water runs between concrete walls with tunnels going
     off from all sides.  It appears to be part of the sewer system.  The dog
     cowers in a corner.  Jonathan moves to his side.

                              JONATHAN
                    Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Come on.  Let's get back to the
                    others.  We can't leave them alone.

                              JONATHAN
                    It's alright.  I can tell by the way
                    the dog's acting that whatever was
                    out there is gone.  What is this
                    place?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Not on the map.  Looks like it
                    connects with the city sewer.

     Pendergast calls back down the tunnel for the deputies.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We're coming back!

     The words go unanswered.  From the hall comes a loud REPORT.  It's the
     shotguns, blasting desperately.  Something flies up all around them as
     the sound echoes.  BATS!

     Pendergast and Jonathan shield themselves from the flurry of beating
     wings.  Finally the animals settle and Pendergast and Jonathan exchange
     a look.  The silence is filled by a soft RUMBLING SOUND.  They stand
     together, waiting.  Pendergast points his gun at the hall leading back
     to the deputies.  A ridge of hair on the dog's back rises and it
     growls.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Identify yourself!  Who's there?

     No answer.  The rumbling continues, growing louder.  Then a dark object
     appears.  It comes rolling out of the hallway, bounces in front of them
     and stops.  Pendergast shines his light on... 

     DEPUTY ONE'S HEAD!  The mouth is open wide in terror.  Across the cheek
     is a vicious claw mark.

                              JONATHAN
                    Oh... my... God!

                              PENDERGAST
                        (hisses)
                    Quiet.

     And now they hear a GUT WRENCHING SHRIEK that's abruptly cut off,
     followed by a second rumbling sound!  Jonathan grabs Pendergast by the
     shirt, panicked.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Stay calm.

     They head quietly for the exit at the other end of room which seems to
     slope up.  After they're gone a few moments the head of DEPUTY TWO
     rolls to a stop.

     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

     Cabs and limousines tangle outside the west entrance.  A huge rotating
     SPOTLIGHT is now turned on.  Elegantly dressed men in dinner jackets
     and women in gowns rush to get out of the pelting rain, umbrellas
     jousting.

     INT. CUTHBERT'S OFFICE - EVENING

     Cuthbert's putting on his tux.  He adjusts the cummerbund, humming
     happily as D'Agosta looks on.  D'Agosta paces, highly agitated and
     worried.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I'm telling you, something's wrong.
                    I still haven't heard from
                    Pendergast.  I think you should call
                    it off.

                              CUTHBERT
                    It's too late now.  Guests are
                    arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling
                    up.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I'll go down and speak to him.

                              CUTHBERT
                        (irritated)
                    You haven't got the authority.  Only
                    Pendergast can pull the plug.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't
                    you understand?  He still hasn't come
                    back.  It's been over three hours --

                              CUTHBERT
                    He'll be back.  Relax.  We're in good
                    shape.  Your security is air tight.
                    There've been no more incidents,
                    nothing suspicious.  There's no
                    reason to call off the opening now.

     INT. GREAT ROTUNDA - NIGHT

     Resounding with the echoes of several hundred expensive shoes crossing
     the marble expanse and heading down the rows of palm trees leading to
     the Hall of Heavens.  The palms themselves are festooned with orchids
     and violet lights.  Somewhere inside, an invisible band is playing "New
     York, New York".  An army of waiters in white tie thread their way
     through the guests carrying large silver platters crowded with
     champagne glasses.  Cuthbert enters and crosses to meet The MAYOR and
     THE MAYOR'S WIFE.  Photographers step forward and flashbulbs pop.

     INT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT

     Food is out.  Hundreds of tables are set with black linen table cloths.
     Decorations have a dark, haunted house theme.  A hum of activity floats
     up past the vast Corinthian columns into the circular dome above.

     INT. MARGO'S LABORATORIES - NIGHT

     An explosive sneeze rattles the beakers and dislodges the plant
     specimens.  Margo interrupts her work at the computer to hand Greg a
     tissue as Frock looks on.

                              KAWAKITA
                    What kind of egg is it?

                              MARGO
                    It's reptilian.

                              FROCK
                    Like the claw.

                              MARGO
                        (cautious)
                    Let's not jump to conclusions.  This
                    egg could belong to any number of
                    reptiles, Dr. Frock.

                              FROCK
                        (excited)
                    Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge
                    of something huge.  Let's consider
                    the possibility, just the three of
                    us, alone in this room.  What if John
                    was right.  I mean, what if?  And he
                    sent back an egg of his monster in
                    the crates.  When it got to the
                    museum, it hatched.

                              MARGO
                    Several problems with that theory.
                    For one thing, this egg is intact.
                    For another, according to
                    Pendergast, the crates were shipped
                    here on a boat.  Everyone on board
                    was killed like Beauregard.  If the
                    thing hatched in mid-ocean, where
                    did it go?

     Frock has no answer.  Greg gestures to his computer screen.

                              KAWAKITA
                    I guess you're not interested in
                    this plant anymore, but the chemical
                    analysis is done.  Frock reads the
                    computer over Greg's shoulder.

                              FROCK
                    "Genus: Unknown.  Family: Unknown.
                    Order: Unknown.  Phylum: Unknown.
                    Cripes, Margo, what did you give me?
                    Is this an animal or one funky
                    shrub?"
                        (to Kawakita)
                    I see you've been programming the
                    computer vocabulary again.

                              MARGO
                        (points to a hexagonal symbol)
                    Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus
                    protein.  That explains why the
                    computer's confused.  The plant's
                    infected with a virus.

                              FROCK
                    That's not so unusual.  Many plants
                    carry viruses.  Like the burls on
                    Maple trees.

                              MARGO
                    But a virus normally codes for other
                    viruses.  This one's making human and
                    animal proteins.  Listen to this.
                        (reads)
                    "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid.
                    Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4-
                    monoxytocin supressin hormone."

                              KAWAKITA
                    These plant fibers are loaded with
                    hormones!

                              MARGO
                    What kind of hormones?

     Kawakita pulls a heavy book from the shelf.  The Encyclopedia of
     Biochemistry, thumbs to a page and reads.

                              KAWAKITA
                    4-monoxytocin is... "A hormone
                    secreted by the human hypothalamus
                    gland."

                              MARGO
                    Try Weinstein's tropic hormone.

     The tension is rising in the room.  Frock takes the book, looks this
     one up, reads silently and removes his glasses.

                              FROCK
                    A hormone secreted by the human
                    thalamus gland.

     Kawakita and Frock look puzzled.  Margo rises in agitation.

                              MARGO
                    This is it.  This is what he, or
                    it... is after!  The plant has high
                    concentrations of the same hormones
                    found in minute quantities in the
                    human brain!

                              KAWAKITA
                    So what?

                              MARGO
                    Pendergast told me the killer
                    extracts and eats the hypothalamus
                    and thalamus of the victim's brains!

                              KAWAKITA
                        (pales)
                    Eats them?

                              MARGO
                    Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may
                    have lived on this plant.  When the
                    crates were put in secure storage,
                    they were out of reach.  The killer
                    couldn't get them, so it got the
                    next best thing.

                              FROCK
                    Beauregard's head.

     There's a moment of stunned silence.  Then a LOUD BUZZER makes them all
     jump.

                              MARGO
                    It's all right.  That means the
                    G.S.E.  has finished analyzing the
                    claw DNA.  Greg, you go find
                    Pendergast and Lieutenant D'Agosta
                    now.

     INT. MUSEUM HALLWAYS - NIGHT

     Kawakita tears up the dark stairs.  He turns a corner and something
     JUMPS OUT at him.  He almost screams.  It's a DRUNK.

                              DRUNK
                    Hey, where 'za little boys room?

                              KAWAKITA
                    Down that hallway.  But don't stay
                    long.  You don't want to be here
                    alone.

     INT. MARGO'S LAB - NIGHT

     Margo and Frock enter and huddle over a sheaf of papers that the
     printer has spit out.

                              MARGO
                    All right, assuming the program is
                    accurate, this is a description of
                    the animal with that claw.
                        (she reads)
                    "Species unidentified.  Genus:
                    unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male,
                    weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain
                    capacity, 900 centimeters." That
                    means it's highly intelligent.
                    "Quadrupedal."

                              FROCK
                    Quadrupedal!  The other name for
                    Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."

     Margo and Frock exchange a look.  Holy shit.  Margo swallows and keeps
     reading.

                              MARGO
                    "Nocturnal.  External hair and bony
                    plates.  Locomotor speed 60-70
                    kilometers.  Reduced optic chiasm"... 
                    poor eyesight.  "External mucoid
                    nasal glands,"... very keen scent... 
                    "Morphological characteristics:
                    Highly robust.  Aggressiveness:
                    extreme."

                              FROCK
                    So the claw came from a huge
                    creature with a preternatural sense
                    of smell and poor eyesight that
                    hunts at night.

                              MARGO
                    With the intelligence of a human
                    being, the speed of a greyhound, and
                    the strength of a grizzly bear.

                              FROCK
                        (a long moment)
                    Margo, what you've just described is
                    a killing machine.

                              MARGO
                    And it's hungry.  It's been two days
                    since it's eaten.  There are five
                    hundred people arriving right now.
                    The animal hunts at night and it has
                    a keen sense of smell!  All those
                    people in one enclosed space... 

                              FROCK
                    It's like ringing the dinner bell.

     INT. ENTRANCE TO SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - ROTUNDA - NIGHT

     The crowd is now packed into the rotunda as the MAYOR cuts a red
     ribbon across the entrance to the exhibit and everyone applauds.
     Cuthbert is by the mayor's side.  He steps forward and raises his hand
     for quiet.  The crowd falls silent.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Thank you everyone and welcome.
                    We're glad all of you were willing
                    to brave the inclement weather to be
                    with us tonight.  Our special thanks
                    to his honor, the mayor and his
                    lovely wife.

     The Mayor takes a bow.  More applause.

                              CUTHBERT (CON'T)
                    Some people have questioned whether
                    a superstition exhibit belongs in a
                    Museum of Science.  Spells,
                    incantations, demons, magic... these
                    are forces that defy the natural
                    laws.  Superstition provides answers
                    to the great questions based on
                    fear.  Science provides answers to
                    the great questions based on truth.
                    Science and superstition, then, are
                    polar opposites.  Mortal enemies, if
                    you will.  And that is why we are
                    here tonight.  We have come to learn
                    more about the enemy, and thus to
                    bring about its defeat.  For every
                    good, there is an evil, for every
                    dark, a light.  And so tonight... my
                    friends, I give you ignorance,
                    terror, unreasoning fear, pure evil.
                        (smiles, gestures to the exhibit)
                    Have a great time.

     Everyone laughs, applauds again as Cuthbert and the Mayor lead the way
     inside.  Kawakita is making his way over to D'Agosta.  The crush at the
     entrance is incredible.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Lieutenant!  It's me.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What is it?

                              KAWAKITA
                    Dr. Green has to see you!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Got my hands full here.

                              KAWAKITA
                    It's important.  Please.  You have to
                    come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found
                    out something.

     D'Agosta pulls out his walkie talkie.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    McNitt?  D'Agosta here.

     INT. SECURITY COMMAND CENTER - MUSEUM - NIGHT

     Officer McNitt stands in the corner of the computer room, bathed in
     neon light.  Running the security system is GEORGE, your basic computer
     nerd.  Multiple screens all over show various rooms in the museum.  Most
     are empty with the exception of those showing the exhibition.  On
     these, the crowds can be seen entering the various rooms.  McNitt holds
     his walkie talkie.

                              MCNITT
                    Yeah Lieutenant?  I'm here.

                              D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)
                    I'm heading to the Evolutionary Bio
                    labs.  Any sign of Pendergast?

                              MCNITT
                    Not yet.

     At this moment a NOISE comes from the adjoining room.  McNitt's head
     SWIVELS.  It's a LOUD THUMP.

                              MCNITT
                    Hold on Lieutenant.
                        (to George)
                    What was that?

                              GEORGE
                    Probably just something wrong with
                    the air conditioning.  There's a shit
                    load of electrical rooms back there.

     George is playing an elaborate computer game and not paying attention.
     McNitt returns to his walkie talkie as the THUMP comes again.  Now he
     looks distinctly nervous.

                              MCNITT
                    Lieutenant?  There's something wrong
                    in the computer room.

                              D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)
                    Goddamn it.  I'll get Ippolito and
                    send him up.

     George rises.

                              GEORGE
                    You're over-reacting.  Sounds like
                    the air conditioning to me.

     McNitt watches uneasily as George opens the door, disappears into the
     next room.

     INT. ENTRANCE - SUPERSTITION EXIBIT - NIGHT

     D'Agosta turns to Kawakita who waits, shifting from foot to foot.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Damn.  There's some kind of problem
                    in the computer room.  I have to go
                    get Ippolito.  You wait here.

     D'Agosta heads into the exhibit before Kawakita can protest.

     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT

     We see various cuts of people as they move into the different rooms.  A
     TEENAGE GIRL (LAUREN) and her FATHER (DAVID) examine a lidless,
     rotting European style coffin, complete with corpse.  A white haired
     gentleman (DR. POUND), leans on his cane as he looks at a display on
     primitive medicine practiced with implements that look like torture
     tools.

     Cuthbert and Ippolito are at the head of a press of people, giving the
     MAYOR and HIS WIFE a guided tour.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Here we have a very rare sacrificial
                    table from Mesoamerica.  The priests
                    would kill the victim on this slab,
                    cut out the heart and eat it while
                    it was still beating.

                              MAYOR
                    I could use one of these things in
                    City Hall.

     Cuthbert laughs right on cue.  They pass a Congo power figure with its
     bulging eye sockets and torso riddled with sharp nails.  Several people
     recoil from it, looking repulsed.  The MAYOR's WIFE sees it and looks
     distressed.

                              MAYOR'S WIFE
                    You're letting kids see this?  I
                    should think they'd have nightmares.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Kid will love it.  They're our target
                    audience.  Nothing here is as violent
                    as what they see on T.V.

     They pass a MUMMY dripping in BLOOD.  The Mayor gestures to it.

                              MAYOR
                    I don't know.  That could be a little
                    over the top.  It's not even
                    scientific.  Mummies don't bleed.

     Cuthbert's smile fades as he sees the mummy.

     CLOSE ON... the MAYOR'S WHITE CUFF as he extends his hand to point at
     the mummy.  The pristine white of his cuff is suddenly colored by a
     falling RED DROP OF BLOOD.

     Cuthbert sees it.  So does the Mayor and Ippolito.  They look up as
     another DROP OF BLOOD falls right on Cuthbert's face.  And yet another
     droplet falls on THE MAYOR'S WIFE'S white bosom, exposed by her low
     cut dress!

                              CUTHBERT
                    Oh... my... God... 

     THEIR POV... above the mummy's head, the top of the case is cut away,
     exposing a ceiling crawling with steam pipes and ductwork.  A hand, a
     watch, and the cuff of a blue shirt protrude over the edge of the
     case.  A small icicle of blood hangs from the middle finger.  And
     another drop FALLS.

     CUTHBERT SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS!  Conscious of the panic
     factor, Ippolito yells.

                              IPPOLITO
                    Quiet everyone!

     But it's too late.  The room is packed with people.  And D'Agosta
     himself is just pushing through the door as another woman cries out... 

                              WOMAN
                    There's a body up there!

     A ripple of fear goes over the faces in the room, titters as people
     wonder if it's a joke.  At that moment from the darkness above, the
     ceiling buckles and something FALLS!

     It's OFFICER DOYLE'S HEADLESS TORSO, dripping blood!

     UTTER PANDEMONIUM breaks loose!  The close space ECHOES with screams
     and shouts.  People claw at each other, stumbling desperately trying to
     get to the door.  A YOUNG WOMAN falls and D'Agosta runs to her to keep
     her from being trampled in the stampede.

     INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

     McNitt is staring in horror at the remote camera images showing the
     chaos in the exhibition, the faces registering blind fear.  Alarms
     start going off all over the place.  McNitt calls out... panicked... 

                              MCNITT
                    George!  Get out here, now!

     McNitt looks around, desperate.  But George still isn't here.  The door
     to the electrical room is still open.  The ceiling shudders from
     thundering feet.  McNitt can hear distant SCREAMS!  It's raising the
     hair on the back of his neck.  He calls out.

                              MCNITT
                    George!  Where are you?

     No answer.  He moves to the open door, a new fear in his eyes.  He looks
     inside.

     INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT

     BLACKNESS.  McNitt can't find a light switch.  He stays in the doorway,
     silhouetted by light from the computer room.  With shaking hands McNitt
     pumps a slug into the chamber of his shotgun.  There's a strange, low,
     gurgling sound.  It's McNitt's stomach.  He silences it, swallows.

                              MCNITT
                    Hey you?  George!  Damn it.  Where are
                    you?  No response.

     McNitt edges into the darkened rooms.  The first one's empty.  He tries
     the next.

                              MCNITT
                    George!  We've got an emergency!  Are
                    you here?

     Suddenly there's a HUGE THUMP and a scuttling to his left!  It's a
     terrifying sound!  McNitt drops to his knees and pumps three rounds,
     each with a light and a deafening blast!  A SHOWER OF SPARKS and a gout
     of flame licks upwards, illuminating the room with orange light.  A
     HUGE DARK SHAPE ducks out the door!

                              MCNITT
                    Oh God.  Oh God!

     Gunpowder hangs in the air like a blue fog.  On the far wall, a mounted
     metal box is smoking from three large, ragged holes!  With a sudden
     pop, an electrical arc slices across the ruined box, followed by a
     crackling and a shower of sparks.  McNitt ducks back into the computer
     room, slams the door and locks it, breathing hard.

     INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

     Every single screen flickers and dims.  But to McNitt's relief, George
     has returned.  He is sitting with his back to the doorway in his chair.

                              MCNITT
                    George!  I saw something in there!  I
                    fired but I think I missed it!

     George remains still, his back to McNitt, staring at the computer game
     on the flickering screen.

                              MCNITT
                    George, for Chrissake answer me!

     McNitt puts a hand on George's shoulder, swivels his chair around.

     ON GEORGE... His face ripped off.

     INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT

     ON THE CENTRAL SWITCHING BOX... sparking and shorting as an ENORMOUS
     CLAWED ARM SWIPES IT OFF THE WALL!

     INT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT

     Everyone pours out of the exhibit, running for the door leading to the
     Rotunda.  People are getting trampled.  It's a terrible crush.  Screams!
     Tables over-turned everywhere.  Food scatters to the floor.  D'AGOSTA
     pushes his way out of the exhibit, crosses to Kawakita, who is
     appalled.  Above, the chandeliers are flickering.

                              KAWAKITA
                    What happened?!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    There's a dead body in the exhibit!
                    People are panicking, trampling each
                    other trying to get out.

     Ippolito runs over to join them.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What the hell is going on?!

     Above them THE LIGHTS dim again and come back on.

                              IPPOLITO
                    The whole system is shutting down!
                    We have to get out quickly before
                    the fire doors fall!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What doors?

                              IPPOLITO
                    I told you!  They seal off all the
                    cells.  They were designed to fall
                    automatically in a system failure --

                              D'AGOSTA
                    You said the system couldn't fail!

     At this there's a low rumble from above.  D'Agosta looks up and sees A
     LARGE METAL DOOR IS DESCENDING from a slot in the ceiling, and not in
     an orderly fashion.  It's falling fast.  Below are crowds of people, all
     pushing to get out!  Officer Bailey, near the door, sees it.

                              BAILEY
                    Above you!  Look out!

     His voice is lost in an ocean of screaming.  Kawakita stands in total
     horror a moment, then joins Bailey and D'Agosta.

     All of them try to restrain people from trying to beat the door.
     Ippolito, on the other hand, elbows his way to the front of the
     fleeing crowd!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Ippolito!  Get back here!

                              IPPOLITO
                    Like hell!

     Ignoring D'Agosta, Ippolito pushes past.  He barrels over an OLD MAN
     who stumbles and falls DIRECTLY BENEATH THE FALLING DOOR!  Ippolito
     jumps over him and is out!

     The old man looks up at the descending wall of steel and SCREAMS!
     D'AGOSTA runs forward, dives for the old man but he's not in time.

     Kawakita covers his eyes, unable to watch as the lights flicker a
     third and last time.  The room is plunged into darkness.  And over the
     screams we hear the rumble and CRASH, the horrifying cries of the old
     man, as the door comes down.

     INT. MARGO'S LAB - NIGHT

     Margo and Frock stand in the darkness.  Through a high window we can
     see lightning flash.

                              MARGO
                    What's going on?

                              FROCK
                    Some kind of power failure.  Maybe
                    it's the storm.  Do you have a
                    flashlight?

                              MARGO
                    I think so.

     She gets one from a cupboard.

                              FROCK
                    Greg's been gone over a half hour.
                    We'd better get out of here.  Get the
                    crate.

     INT. HALLWAYS - NIGHT

     Frock wheels his chair as fast as he can.  Margo runs beside him
     carrying the crate with the fibers inside.  A peel of thunder ends and
     distant screaming is heard.  Margo stops, appalled.

                              MARGO
                    Dr. Frock.  Did you hear that?

                              FROCK
                    Don't stop now.

     Up ahead they hear METALLIC RUMBLING and a CRASH!  They round a corner
     and come up against a huge STEEL DOOR.

                              MARGO
                    What's that?

                              FROCK
                    It's one of the fire doors.  Good
                    Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!

     INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Pendergast stands at the end of a cul de sac, studying the blue prints
     by a stone wall.  Jonathan and the dog are with him, exhausted and
     terrified.  Jonathan keeps an eye on the corridor behind them as
     Pendergast works.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I know where we are now.  We're
                    getting out, Jonathan.  This should
                    be another door.

     Taking a pen knife from his pocket, Pendergast places it into the
     plaster and gently twists the blade.  A piece of plaster the size of a
     dinner plate falls, revealing the tracings of another doorway.
     Pendergast shoves the door open to reveal a dark, dusty room.

                              JONATHAN
                    Hallelujah, Pendergast.  Where the
                    hell are we now?

     INT. "ALCOHOLIC" ROOM - NIGHT

     Jonathan and Pendergast enter quickly from the hidden rear door.
     Pendergast shines his beam on dusty shelves filled with specimens.  All
     are stored in jars of alcohol.  There are fetuses of many different
     species.  We see a pig, a cow, a duck billed platypus as well as brain
     sections, a disembodied monkey head.  One rectangular glass container
     holds a skinned human foot.

                              JONATHAN
                    Jesus, what is this?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Another storage room.

     Pendergast tries the light switch to no effect.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Something's happened.  The power's
                    out.

     They cross the room to the main door and exit.  Now they're in... 

     INT. OSTEO PREP - LAB - NIGHT

     Pendergast shines his light on the maceration tanks.  The humming of
     the bugs can be heard in their cabinet.

                              PENDERGAST
                    All right.  I know where we are.  This
                    is the osteo prep lab.  I was in here
                    earlier.  We're safe now.

     With these words, the dog GROWLS.  Jonathan freezes and sniffs the air.

                              JONATHAN
                    Oh no.  I smell it.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Keep the animal quiet.

     Jonathan kneels by Hobbes as Pendergast listens, every nerve on end.  A
     sound comes from the adjacent hallway that leads to the secure storage
     area.  It's unmistakable HEAVY BREATHING and the creeping movement of
     claws.  Pendergast lifts his gun.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Go out the other doorway.  There's a
                    stair at the end of the hall.  Up
                    five flights is a corridor that
                    leads to the Hall of the Heavens.
                    Find Lieutenant D'Agosta.  Bring
                    help.

     Jonathan doesn't have to be told twice.  He takes the dog and exits
     from the other side of the lab leaving Pendergast alone.  Pendergast
     waits a moment until Jonathan's safely out of sight.  He switches off
     his flashlight, backs up slowly, step by step.  He opens the door to
     the alcoholics storage.  As he slips inside a DARK SHAPE appears.

     INT. "ALCOHOLICS" STORAGE - NIGHT

     Slowly, making no sound, Pendergast lifts the .45 Anaconda, passes his
     finger over the cylinder, checking the loaded chambers.  Then he
     steadies the revolver and levels it at the door.  The hideous pickled
     specimens seem to hover all around him.  The smell is overwhelming and
     the snuffling is louder now.

     It's coming closer.  After a long moment there is a faint bump at the
     door.  This is followed by a low scratching noise... Pendergast watches
     frozen in horror, holding his breath.

     THE DOORKNOB BEGINS TO TURN!  Not knowing what else to do, Pendergast
     simply grabs it from the inside and holds on!

     OUTSIDE he hears an AMUSED SNORT, then a LOW GROWL.  There's ONE HARD
     HIT and the door shivers.  THE DOORKNOB FALLS OFF!  It's over now.
     Pendergast kneels down, bracing the gun in both hands.  From this
     position he can see right through the hole where the doorknob fell.
     His mouth literally drops in astonishment as he sees... 

     a HUGE, red-rimmed, GREEN EYE!

     Involuntarily Pendergast LEAPS BACK, nearly falls and drops the gun!
     Beakers crash around him.  He scrambles in the darkness.  The flashlight
     falls and pops back on.  The beam streaks up crazily.  It's chaos.
     Pendergast is an easy target now.  He grabs for the light, the gun,
     steadies himself, breathing fast and low.  His heart pounds.  But
     nothing more happens.  The silence is heavy.  The eye is gone.  And
     suddenly Pendergast understands.

     In the distance he can hear HUMAN VOICES and a rolling wheelchair!
     Somewhere nearby are MARGO AND FROCK!  The monster has left him to get
     bigger game.  Fear for Margo and Frock lights Pendergast's eyes.  All
     panic and disorganization are gone.  He holds his revolver at 12
     o'clock and KICKS the door open, leaps out as

     A HUGE DARK SHAPE DARTS FROM THE ROOM.  It's headed for the secure
     storage areas again!  Pendergast takes off.  Not knowing how else to
     address this thing he finds himself calling... 

                              PENDERGAST
                    Halt!

     INT. SECURE STORAGE HALLWAY - BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Pendergast runs into the hallway but he's already too late.  The
     hulking shape of the quadruped is moving at incredible speed.

     ON PENDERGAST... as he levels his gun and shoots.

     THE CREATURE... stops, rears back on its haunches, looks once at
     Pendergast, pissed.  As the VOICES around the far corner fall silent,
     Pendergast FIRES.  The shot blasts off a piece of the wall.

     With astonishing speed and agility for its bulk, the beast turns and
     leaps around the corner, passing out of Pendergast's sight.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Margo!  Frock!  It's coming!  Run!

     AROUND THE CORNER... 

     Are MARGO AND FROCK... Frock holds the keys to secure storage area 1012
     in his hand.  Margo has the flashlight and the crate with the fibers.
     They can hear the sound of thundering movement.

                              FROCK
                    Look!

     Margo points her light in the distance and illuminates the beast!  It's
     descending like a freight train.  One split second of sheer amazement,
     then... 

                              MARGO
                    Dr. Frock!  Quick!

     Frock, immobilized in his wheel chair, stares at the monster, like a
     trapped rabbit looking at a descending hawk.  Margo grabs his keys from
     him, fumbles desperately to open the door.  It swings wide at last.  She
     grabs the handles of the wheelchair, tugs with all her might.  The
     wheels bump into the door frame but somehow she wrestles the damn
     thing inside.

     INT. SECURE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT

     Margo shoves Frock behind her, slams the door shut.  Seconds later, the
     beast throws itself against the storage door.  They hear it outside,
     growling in fury, claws lashing out.  Margo and Frock press back in the
     darkness, terror in their eyes.

     INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Pendergast runs forward in the echoing hallway, his gun drawn, his
     flashlight on.  A few more steps and he holds hard.  His eyes go wide in
     astonishment as his light illuminates the beast.  It's tearing at the
     steel door furiously with incredible force.

     As the flashlight beam hits it, MBWUN roars and looks up.  Now we see
     it clearly for the first time.  The monster is MASSIVE, putrid, rank.
     Slit reptilian green eyes are rimmed in red.  A ridge of stiff black
     hair rises on the creature's buffalo-like humped back.  The withers are
     muscled and covered with plates.  A forked TONGUE licks out as purple
     lips draw back exposing razor sharp teeth.  The claws raise up to fend
     off the light.

     PENDERGAST steadies himself with difficulty, takes a few seconds to
     aim with the greatest care.  Mbwun makes a move towards him and he
     squeezes the trigger hard.  The gun echoes in the hall.  A split second
     and a white streak moves right up the beast's cranium.  A direct hit.
     The shot echoes and Mbwun drops it's claws.

     The flashlight continues to shine like a high beam right into the
     beast's eyes.  Angry and blinded, the creature turns and in a moment,
     lopes off.  Pendergast watches, unimaginably relieved.  Realizing what
     just happened, his knees start to buckle.  He catches himself, wipes
     one hand across his eyes.  A voice comes from the storage room.

                              MARGO (OS)
                    Pendergast?  Are you all right?

                              PENDERGAST
                    No.  I think I'm hallucinating.

     The storage door opens slowly and Margo looks out.

                              MARGO
                    You're not.  Where is it?

                              PENDERGAST
                        (shakes his head)
                    Gone.

                              MARGO
                    Wounded?

                              PENDERGAST
                    No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45
                    caliber bullet bounced off that
                    thing's skull like a spit ball.  I
                    think it was bothered by my light.

                              MARGO
                    That would fit.  It's nocturnal.
                    Quick.  Come inside.

     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

     As hundreds of the guests emerge into the pounding rain... crying,
     terrified, unclear what exactly happened.  These are the lucky ones.
     Among them we find IPPOLITO.  His walkie talkie is squawking.  The
     windows of the museum behind him are black.

                              D'AGOSTA ON RADIO
                    Ippolito!  Where the hell are you?
                    We're trapped in here!  We need help!
                    Ippolito!  Come in, dammit!

     Ippolito sits down on the steps in the rain, knowing the extent of
     what he's done.  The wheels are working hard now, trying to figure out
     damage control.  The walkie talkie keeps calling.  He doesn't respond.

     INT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT

     Tables are overturned, food lies on the ground, people cower in the
     darkness.  D'Agosta crouches in some broken glass with his walkie
     talkie.  He shuts it off, rises, looks around.  Light comes from a few
     sputtering candles.

     Most of the guests still trapped inside are grouped around the lowered
     steel door.  Among them are KAWAKITA and CUTHBERT.  From the BODY of the
     man crushed underneath the door extends a large puddle of blood.
     Bailey is working in desperation on a brass panel by the door.

                              BAILEY
                    Manual overrides aren't working.  I'm
                    getting nothing, Lieutenant.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Great.

     Frank, the father of the teenage girl, Lauren, steps forward.

                              FRANK
                    There's no power.  The whole system's
                    down.

     The crowd starts to murmur.  One man yells.

                              MAN
                    We're trapped!  And there's a killer
                    in here!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    We'll get out safely if everyone
                    stays calm.  Is anyone else hurt?

     The MAYOR stands.  His wife's forehead is bleeding.

                              MAYOR
                    Yes.  My wife.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Is there a doctor?

     The distinguished grey haired man with a cane comes forward.  DR.
     POUND.

                              POUND
                    I'm Dr. Pound.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Check this woman and see if anyone
                    else needs you.

     Pound moves off.  Everyone spins now at the incongruous sound of a DOG
     BARK.  D'Agosta pulls his gun.  The door to a stairwell at the far end
     of the room opens and Hobbes bounds into the hall!  He's followed by
     Jonathan, who is filthy and wild-eyed.

                              JONATHAN
                        (calls)
                    Lieutenant D'Agosta!  Don't shoot.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Where's Pendergast?

                              JONATHAN
                        (crossing, breathless)
                    Five flights down.  We were lost in
                    the sub-basement.  Something's down
                    there.  It killed our two deputies.
                    When I left Pendergast it was coming
                    back.  He sent me for help.  We have
                    to hurry.

     D'Agosta makes a quick sweep of the room with his flashlight.  The
     remote corners of the hall are so black the light seems to disappear.
     In the center, two men are bending over a still form.  One of them is
     Dr. Pound.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Both of you.  Get back here.

                              POUND
                    But he's still alive --

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Get back now!

     The urgency in D'Agosta's voice gets everyone's attention.  The Mayor
     brings his wife over.  Cuthbert comes too.  They huddle apart from the
     others.  Cuthbert's white with fear.

                              CUTHBERT
                    What's going on?

     D'Agosta speaks low.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    There's some kind of animal loose in
                    the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He
                    needs help.  I want volunteers to go
                    with me.

                              BAILEY
                    I'm in.

                              KAWAKITA
                        (swallows)
                    Me too.

                              CUTHBERT
                        (voice rising in fear)
                    I'd do it gladly but someone needs
                    to stay with these people.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    All right.  You're elected.  Bailey,
                    get all the guns and flashlights,
                    give the mayor your walkie talkie so
                    we can keep in touch.  Cuthbert, keep
                    everyone together and make sure they
                    stay quiet.

     Frank steps forward.

                              FRANK
                    I was in the Marines.  Give me a gun.
                    I'd go with you, too, but I've got
                    my daughter.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What's your name?

                              FRANK
                    Frank.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    All right.  You guard these people
                    and your daughter.

     D'Agosta gives Frank his service revolver.

                              MAYOR'S WIFE
                        (to D'Agosta)
                    Where are you going?  Don't leave us
                    alone!

     The remaining crowd begins to whimper.  The Mayor rises.

                              MAYOR
                    Everyone quiet.  The Lieutenant's in
                    charge.

     Bailey and D'Agosta carry shot guns.  They quietly move to the back
     stairwell at the far end of the Hall of the Heavens.  Everyone else
     bunches together and watches.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Bailey, we'll go first and check the
                    stairwell.  Jonathan, you and Greg
                    guard the door.

     Jonathan gives Hobbes' leash to the Mayor.  D'Agosta hands Greg
     Kawakita a shotgun, tightens his grip on his own.  Then he gives the
     signal and Bailey yanks open the door to the stairwell.

     INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

     D'Agosta and Bailey go in slowly.  Jonathan stays in the doorway,
     sweeping the stairwell with his flashlight.  Kawakita gingerly holds
     his shotgun.  He's scared out of his mind.  He turns to Jonathan,
     whispers.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Excuse me.  Could you tell me how
                    this thing works?

                              JONATHAN
                    Oh Jesus.  Don't point it at me.  Just
                    aim and shoot.

     D'Agosta heads down the stairs in the lead, with Bailey close behind.
     The stairwell is windowless and dark.  D'Agosta shines his light and it
     cuts into the blackness.  He moves quietly, makes the first landing and
     stops.  Bailey watches his back from several steps behind as D'Agosta
     signals for him to wait.  The flashlight flares into a glass door one
     flight down.  D'Agosta raises his hand.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (low)
                    Hold on.  I thought I saw something.

     Everyone stops.  Bailey pumps his shotgun.  So does Jonathan.  Kawakita
     fumbles to do like the others.  They wait.  D'Agosta moves alone down
     several more steps.  The silence is heavy.  Suddenly D'Agosta wrinkles
     his nose.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Whoa... You smell that?

                              JONATHAN
                    Lieutenant!  Get back!

     Too late.  At this something DROPS FROM ABOVE!  A huge dark shape LEAPS
     INTO THE STAIRWELL, descending two floors!  It lands, pounces on BAILEY
     and the marble walls echo with a ROAR.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    BAILEY!!!

     Bailey SCREAMS in terror as Mbwun pins him down!

                              BAILEY
                    NOOOOO!

     CLOSE ON BAILEY... Three claws close on his neck and WRENCH HARD!
     There's a horrifying snap as Bailey's HEAD COMES OFF!  Blood SPURTS all
     over and drips down the stairs.

     D'AGOSTA levels his shotgun at the monster and fires, with no apparent
     effect.  When the shots stop echoing we hear SCREAMS and FRANTIC
     BARKING from the hall.

     MBWUN'S GREEN EYES look up and it's FORKED TONGUE LICKS OUT.  The
     monster LEAPS PAST Bailey's body and heads for the door!  D'Agosta,
     seeing what's happening, screams at the top of his lungs.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Jonathan!  Don't let it get into the
                    hall!

     ON JONATHAN... frozen in the doorway, Kawakita by his side.  Both of
     them are rigid with horror.  Disbelief in their eyes.  The BEAST leaps
     up directly at them as they jump to try and close the door.

     D'Agosta keeps firing until he's pumping an empty chamber.  Plaster is
     falling all around.  SCREAMS resound in the Hall of the Heavens as
     D'Agosta stumbles up the stairs.

     INT. HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT

     D'Agosta throws open the doors and charges into the Hall.  Jonathan
     lies on the ground, dazed.  Kawakita stands to one side, teeth
     chattering in shock.  His hand shakes so badly that the barrel of the
     gun swings in his hand.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (yells)
                    Where is it?!

                              JONATHAN
                    I don't know!  It hit me hard.

     D'Agosta pumps two shells in the shotgun.  Screams can be heard from
     the people crouched together at the edge of the room.  Hobbes is
     barking wildly, foaming at the mouth.  It's too dark to see what's
     happening.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (screams)
                    Somebody tell me!  Where is it now?

                              MAYOR
                        (quiet)
                    Lieutenant.  In the south corner.

     D'Agosta sweeps his light to the Mayor who stands rigid in front of
     the others, points to his left.  The light moves to the far end of the
     room where THE DARK SHAPE OF MBWUN crouches over the body of a man.
     It's lunging up and down with odd, jerking motions.  The man is long
     past making a sound.  From the monster comes a faint crunching and
     slobbering.  Jonathan rises, comes to D'Agosta.  So does Frank.  They
     stand shoulder to shoulder, raise their guns.  D'Agosta motions for
     Kawakita.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    On three.

     Kawakita stumbles to join them, tries to join in.  The barrel of his
     shot gun still swings wildly.  He steadies it by taking it in both
     hands.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    One, two... three.

     All three fire.  There's a loud report.  The kickback knocks Kawakita
     backwards.  Screams erupt from the huddled group.  Hobbes abruptly shuts
     up.  The men fire and fire until there's nothing left.  D'Agosta reaches
     for more shells, comes up empty.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Jonathan!  Get everyone behind me!

     Jonathan moves.  D'Agosta sweeps his light across the room but already
     the shape is gone.  Cuthbert hides behind the Mayor, calls out in a
     terrified squeal.

                              CUTHBERT
                    It went out the door to the rotunda!

     D'Agosta runs across the room to a set of double industrial doors.
     There's a noise in the darkness beyond and he just manages to slam
     both doors.  He picks up a metal chair and jams it through the handles.
     Backs up.  The doors shudder as something hits them hard.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Get everyone into the stairwell!

     Jonathan, the Mayor, Cuthbert and Kawakita together herd everyone
     towards the stairwell.  They move inside.

     INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

     Dark and close.  The smell of gunpowder and death.  The Mayor's Wife
     sees Bailey's body and clutches her mouth so as not to throw up.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Sweet Jesus!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Get his gun and his walkie talkie,
                    Jonathan.  Move.

                              CUTHBERT
                    My office is on the third floor!
                    There's a walk-in safe and a
                    portable phone!  We can lock
                    ourselves in the safe and call for
                    help!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita
                    and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest
                    of you can go with Cuthbert!

                              MAYOR
                    I think we should stick together!

                              FRANK
                        (taking Bailey's shotgun)
                    Me too.

                              CUTHBERT
                    I'm leaving.  Whoever wants can come
                    with me.

     No one follows.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Wait!

     Cuthbert's gone.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Jonathan, go with him!  He isn't
                    armed.

     Jonathan grabs Hobbes' leash from the Mayor and bounds up the stairs.

                              MAYOR
                    Good luck!

     Everyone else follows D'Agosta.  Together, they head down.

     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

     Police cars are pulling up outside the museum.  Sirens wail.  Torrents
     of rain limit the number of onlookers.  Crowds of people are scattered
     about.  There's disbelief on everyone's faces.  Many people are in
     shock.  Ippolito sprints through the pelting rain to a GUARD STATION
     near the gate.  He yanks the door open and jumps inside.

     INT. GUARD STATION - NIGHT

     A number of museum security personnel are milling in confusion.

                              IPPOLITO
                    All right everyone.  I'm in charge.
                    Status report.

     One of the security men, WATERS, rises.

                              WATERS
                    Swat teams are on the way.  Fire
                    trucks with them.  Everything's
                    slowed down because of the rain.
                    We're bringing in portable
                    generators.  They'll get the
                    emergency lights working but they
                    won't pump enough power to lift the
                    doors.

     Ippolito pulls out his walkie talkie.

                              IPPOLITO
                    D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.

                              D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)
                        (a string of curses followed by...)
                    Where the hell are you?

                              IPPOLITO
                    I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate
                    the rescue efforts from here.  Help
                    is on the way.  Just sit tight.

                              D'AGOSTA (ON RADIO)
                    It's a little late, you son of a
                    bitch.  There's a friggin' monster
                    loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire
                    department.  Find metal cutters, cut
                    through.  And bring a cannon.  The
                    damn thing is huge.

     A long moment as the men look at each other.

                              WATERS
                    Did he say monster?

                              IPPOLITO
                    Panic attack.

     INT. MUSEUM STAIRWELL - NIGHT

     D'Agosta's group has reached a lower floor.  Here this stairwell ends.
     Ahead stretches the hall of the Asian peoples.

                              IPPOLITO (OS)
                    D'Agosta, put on the Mayor.

     D'Agosta passes the walkie talkie to the Mayor.

                              MAYOR
                    Mayor Jordan here.

                              IPPOLITO (ON RADIO)
                    This is Ippolito, head of museum
                    security.  Relieve D'Agosta and take
                    command.

                              MAYOR
                    Don't tell me what to do you chicken
                    shit bastard.  I saw you cut and run!
                    Lieutenant D'Agosta stayed with us.
                    He is in charge.  There is a monster.
                    I saw it.  Cut through those doors
                    and get us out of here, now!

     The Mayor shuts off the walkie talkie and they round another corner
     and disappear from sight.

     INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

     Ippolito finds Waters and the others staring at him.  Humiliated, he
     swallows hard.

                              IPPOLITO
                    All right.  The steel doors are
                    designed to retard cutting.  We can
                    go through them, but it would take
                    hours.

                              WATERS
                    The quickest way in would be to go
                    through the roof, sir.  Cell two goes
                    up to the fifth floor.  There are sky
                    lights up there.

                              IPPOLITO
                    Co-ordinate with the fire department
                    and SWAT teams.  Move.

     INT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT

     It's very dark.  The huge shape of MBWUN can barely be seen sliding out
     of the stairwell and into the Hall of the Asian Peoples.  Then DIM RED
     HALL LIGHTS come on in the corners of the ceiling.  The monster utters
     a low growl.  The emergency generators are beginning to come on.  The
     animal lopes to the spot where we last saw D'Agosta and his group,
     sniffs the ground.  It looks up and, with a curiously human gesture,
     cocks its massive head.

     The silence is broken by VOICES!  They're in the distance and muffled,
     but definitely there.  The monster crouches eagerly, lopes forward with
     great stealth.  The voices are getting louder.  We follow as it goes
     through the hall and down... 

     A STAIRWELL... At the bottom, Mbwun quickly turns a corner... The voices
     have stopped.  Mbwun creeps forward, enters... 

     INT. HALL OF MARINE ANIMALS - NIGHT

     A huge room several stories high.  A WHALE hangs suspended from the
     ceiling.  Dioramas of fish line all the walls.  Mbwun pauses next to a
     diorama of the gentle, vegetarian sea cow, THE MANATEE.  The two make a
     startling contrast.

     A pause and then the voices are heard again, much louder now.  The
     source is right around the edge of the Manatee display.  Mbwun LEAPS
     FORWARD, claws lashing out.  He turns the corner and crashes through a
     wall of GLASS as he grabs at the source of the voices... 

     A display of small, extraordinarily life-like TALKING HOLOGRAMS!
     They've been re-activated with the emergency power system.  Each little
     talking figure is no more then five inches high.  They move around a
     small three dimensional display of marine animals, explaining the lung
     systems of fish.

     MBWUN... stands in the pile of broken glass, stares at the holograms,
     mesmerized.  He makes a noise that sounds astonishingly like a CHUCKLE!
     Then he reaches out one long claw and tries unsuccessfully to touch
     one of the holograms.  But the shadowy creatures can't be caught.  The
     beast seems to realize this, SNORTS and moves off.  As he goes he
     passes behind a

     LARGE GLASS ELEVATOR.  It stands in middle the open room.  The elevator
     is designed to carry people upstairs and down in the two story
     exhibit.  In the dim light, with his poor vision, the monster doesn't
     see D'Agosta, the Mayor, Kawakita, and their entire group SANDWICHED
     INSIDE.  The monster exits the exhibit and quietly D'Agosta slides the
     doors open.  Everyone, all thirty-five people in evening clothes,
     quickly get out and run across the exhibit to another stairwell at the
     far side of the hall.

     INT. SECURE STORAGE AREA 1012 - NIGHT

     Margo, Frock and Pendergast wait in the darkness.  Pendergast, for the
     first time, seems fazed.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I don't know how to deal with this.
                    It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever
                    saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a
                    monster, a supernatural creature
                    like that.

                              MARGO
                    It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an
                    animal.  Part lizard, part human, a
                    genetic freak of some kind, like the
                    half-goat, half-sheep they found
                    last year in the jungles of Vietnam.

                              PENDERGAST
                    But this isn't the jungle!  This is
                    New York.  How did it get here?  A
                    thing like that crossed two
                    continents.  It makes no sense!

                              FROCK
                        (lame)
                    We think it may have something to do
                    with the eggs we found in the crate.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I don't believe it.

                              MARGO
                    None of that matters now.  The people
                    upstairs need us.  We have to help.

                              FROCK
                    We can't.  We've managed to get
                    inside the one place that's safe.  I
                    think we should sit tight and wait
                    for reinforcements.  If we go
                    outside, we're risking more lives.
                    You have to accept it, Margo,
                    there's nothing we can do.  The
                    building must be swarming with
                    police by now.  It won't take long
                    for them to get through the doors.

                              MARGO
                    That thing could kill ten people in
                    a matter of minutes.

                              PENDERGAST
                    But what can we do?  Our guns are
                    useless --

                              MARGO
                    We have the fibers.  Don't you see?
                    The creature is hungry.  It wants the
                    hormones in these plants.  It would
                    take hundreds of human brains to
                    supply what's in these fibers.  We're
                    just a poor substitute.  To make it
                    stop hunting, we have to give it
                    what it wants.

     INT. CUTHBERT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Cuthbert enters with Jonathan and the dog, Hobbes.  Cuthbert locks the
     door with shaking hands.  He mutters to himself in terror.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Solid oak.  Two inches thick.  Tell me
                    they'll hold.

     Cuthbert scurries to his desk and pulls out a Ruger .38 Magnum.

                              CUTHBERT
                    I got it after I was mugged in the
                    subway last spring.

                              JONATHAN
                    Where's the walk-in safe?

                              CUTHBERT
                    Behind you.

                              JONATHAN
                    What's the combination?

                              CUTHBERT
                    I'll do it.  Just let me find my
                    portable phone.

     He rummages in the darkness, going through his desk.

                              JONATHAN
                    Forget it!

                              CUTHBERT
                    Calm down.  I found it!

     Cuthbert flips the phone open and turns it on.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Battery's dead.  Shit.

                              JONATHAN
                    Let's go!

     Cuthbert crosses to a huge wall safe, starts frantically turning the
     tumblers.  Jonathan follows with the dog.

                              CUTHBERT
                    That thing won't come after us,
                    right?  It's going for bigger game.
                    The group blundering around in the
                    basement.  Poor fools.

                              JONATHAN
                    Hurry up!

                              CUTHBERT
                    Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the
                    gun.

     Cuthbert fumbles to hand over the Ruger.  As he does, something drops.

                              CUTHBERT
                    Oh God!  I dropped my rabbit's foot!

     Cuthbert drops to his knees, groping in the darkness.

                              JONATHAN
                    For Chrissake, I'll do it.  What's
                    the combination?!

                              CUTHBERT
                    To the left twice then five no... 
                    sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's
                    been a while... 

                              JONATHAN
                    Oh Jesus... 

     Jonathan starts again, sweating.  The tumblers fall with agonizing
     slowness.  Cuthbert continues groping frantically for his good luck
     charm.  Meanwhile, unnoticed by Jonathan, the dog is staring at the oak
     doors.  We see the HAIR ON HIS BACK rise!

                              JONATHAN
                    Fifteen... what's next?

                              CUTHBERT
                    Eight to the right!  Look!  I found
                    it!

     Clutching the rabbit's foot like a talisman, Cuthbert leaps up just as
     the last tumbler falls.

     At this the oak doors behind them CRASH OPEN, splintering like so many
     match sticks.

     Cuthbert SCREAMS in a high pitch whine at the sight of the beast.  The
     dog barks wildly at Mbwun!  Jonathan lifts his shot gun.  But the
     monster barrels past him and zeros in on Cuthbert!

     A HUGE RED TONGUE LICKS OUT and encircles Cuthbert's waist!  It
     squeezes him horribly, drags him towards the open jaws!  Cuthbert
     bellows like a lamb being led to the slaughter.  He opens his hand and
     the rabbit's foot drops!  The last Jonathan sees of Cuthbert is his
     head disappearing down Mbwun's throat.

     Hobbes barks and whines in terror.  Jonathan takes the leash and drags
     the animal out.

     INT. MUSEUM HALLWAYS - NIGHT

     Jonathan and Hobbes tear down the hallway and disappear.  Behind them
     comes a roar so loud it rattles the walls.

     INT. HALLWAYS - SECURE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT

     The door opens slowly and Pendergast appears.  He shines his beam in
     both directions.

                              PENDERGAST
                    All clear.

     Margo and Frock quickly come out.  Margo holds the crate.  Frock tries
     to follow in his wheelchair.

                              FROCK
                    I'm coming with you.

                              MARGO
                    No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.

                              PENDERGAST
                    You'd slow us down and put Margo in
                    danger.

                              MARGO
                    Unlock one of the other storage
                    rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll
                    leave a trail back to 1012 and try
                    to trap the monster in here.

                              FROCK
                    Margo, this is too dangerous.  You
                    always think you can solve
                    everything.  This time you don't have
                    enough information.  The animal might
                    behave in unexpected ways.
                        (to Pendergast)
                    Leave her here with me.  Don't put
                    her in danger.

                              PENDERGAST
                    He's right.

                              MARGO
                    No.  You'll need me --

     At this a LOUD SOUND comes from upstairs!

                              FROCK
                    What's that?

                              PENDERGAST
                    Footsteps!

                              MARGO
                    No, not footsteps!  People running
                    for their lives!

     All three know this ends the discussion.  Frock opens the door to room
     1010.  Inside are shelves of priceless ivory tusks.  Margo takes
     Pendergast's handkerchief and wraps her hand.  She quickly sprinkles
     some of the fibers inside the door to room 1012.  Before Dr. Frock
     disappears into room 1010, he looks back to Margo one last time.

                              FROCK
                    Come back and get me.

                              MARGO
                    We will.

                              FROCK
                    Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It
                    hunts with its sense of smell.  So
                    for God's sake, Margo, don't get
                    those fibers on your clothes!

     INT. OSTEO PREP - NIGHT

     Margo and Pendergast emerge from the hall to the storage rooms and run
     for the far stairs.  From somewhere above the sound of running is
     louder now.

     INT. PLANETARIUM - NIGHT

     D'Agosta and his group enter the large domed space in disarray.
     They're spread out and panicked, the young helping the old.  Dr. Pound
     is finding it hard to keep up.  Frank and his daughter Lauren bring him
     along.  The Mayor quietly urges people forward.  His wife's face is
     streaked with tears.  Kawakita runs with D'Agosta.

                              KAWAKITA
                    It's still back there!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I know.

     Now a voice is heard in the distance.

                              PENDERGAST (OS)
                    Where are you?  Who's there?

     Everyone stops.  D'Agosta shines his light into the large space.  Above
     them constellations glow.  D'Agosta calls out... 

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Pendergast!

     INT. HALL OF NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT

     Margo and Pendergast run.  Margo carries the crate carefully wrapped in
     Pendergast's jacket.

                              PENDERGAST
                    That was D'Agosta.

                              MARGO
                    The planetarium!

                              PENDERGAST
                        (calls out)
                    Vince!

                              D'AGOSTA (OS)
                    Over here!

     There's a double steel fire door at the end of the hallway.  Pendergast
     and Margo run for it.  Pendergast shoves at the door.  It won't budge.
     There's a small glass window.  In it, D'Agosta's face appears.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (through the window)
                    Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind
                    us!

                              PENDERGAST
                    This door's locked.  Try shooting the
                    hinges off.

     INT. PLANETARIUM - NIGHT

     D'Agosta turns to his group.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Step back!

     D'Agosta, Frank and Kawakita aim their guns at the door and shoot
     repeatedly.  The shots echo wildly.  The sound is terrifyingly loud.  The
     small glass window shatters.  Then the men lean heavily on the door.  It
     still won't budge.  D'Agosta looks through the window.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    It's no use.  We have to get out of
                    here!
                        (to Kawakita)
                    Give them your walkie talkie.

     Kawakita hands his walkie talkie through the window.  Margo takes it.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Is Dr. Frock safe!

                              MARGO
                    Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of
                    yourself!

     INT. HALL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT

     Pendergast looks desperately at the blueprints.

                              MARGO
                    Is there another way around?

                              PENDERGAST
                    No.  The planetarium is in the next
                    cell.  This is one of the fire
                    doors... 

     Pendergast returns to the window.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Vince?  There's no way we can get to
                    you with the fire doors down.
                    There's an entrance to the sub-
                    basement in the hall off the north
                    side exit.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    The sub-basement?

                              PENDERGAST
                    I've been down there.  It links up to
                    the old sewer system.  I can guide
                    you out.

     D'Agosta turns to the others.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    How much ammo do we have to make a
                    stand?

                              KAWAKITA
                    You're asking me?  I don't even know
                    how to load this thing.

                              FRANK
                    Four rounds... 

     There's a movement of air... and a ripe, fetid smell.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Oh shit.

     D'Agosta pumps his shot gun.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I smell it.  It's here.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Go out the north exit!  There's a
                    hallway and a false wall by the
                    Greek vases.  Run!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Everybody.  Get behind me.

     The others move past.  D'Agosta, Frank and Greg Kawakita hold the rear.
     The group runs to the side exit to the planetarium and in a moment,
     disappears.

     INT. HALL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT

     Pendergast remains at the window watching anxiously.  From the south
     entrance to the planetarium, an ENORMOUS DARK SHAPE slinks into view!
     Pendergast steps back from the doorway, turns to Margo.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Hide quickly!

                              MARGO
                    What are you going to do?

     Pendergast checks his gun, totally calm.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Buy them some time.

     Margo turns and looks around at the looming dioramas.  There's a plain
     door at their end of the hall.  Pendergast faces the broken window.

     HIS POV... the beast is slinking away after D'Agosta and the others,
     headed to the north exit from the Planetarium!

     PENDERGAST calls out... 

                              PENDERGAST
                    Hey you big tub of lard!  Over here!

     THE BEAST PAUSES, turns.

     Pendergast puts his palms up at his ears, wiggles his fingers and
     makes a face through the window.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Come on, you smelly pile of refuse.
                    Come get me.  I dare you!

     A LOW surprised GROWL comes from the beast.  It crouches as if to
     pounce.  Pendergast makes more faces, sticks his tongue out.  The beast
     watches in silence, its evil eyes fixed.

     ON MARGO... watching Pendergast.  She can't leave him yet.

                              MARGO
                    What is it doing?

                              PENDERGAST
                        (loud)
                    It's scared of me.

     Suddenly there's a CRASH and the door BENDS like cardboard.  TWO HUGE
     SETS OF CLAWS lash through!  Margo screams as the claws pass inches
     from Pendergast's face.  He leaps back, lifts his gun which looks like
     a pea shooter in the face of Mbwun.

     Two sets of claws curve around the bent edges of the door, then Mbwun
     simply LIFTS it out of the frame.  This leaves Pendergast face to face
     with the foul, enormous monster!  It regards him evenly, blinks once.
     Then the tongue slides out, licks its lips eagerly and... 

     Pendergast FLICKS on his high powered FLASHLIGHT, shining it at close
     range right in the beast's eyes!  Then carefully, with total calm he
     FIRES ONCE, TWICE.  The beast howls more in anger than pain, REARS UP
     and swipes at Pendergast.  Pendergast dives to one side and, the claws
     miss again by inches as the beast is temporarily blinded by the light.
     Now Pendergast spins and runs for all he's worth.  Margo's been
     waiting, holding the door.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Drop the fibers!

     She leaves the crate behind as Pendergast dives inside with her.  Margo
     shoves the door shut hard as Mbwun, still blinded, leaps into the
     hall.  But now, suddenly, all is quiet.  No sign of Margo and
     Pendergast.  The beast moves forward, snuffling slowly.  It starts for
     the door which hides Margo and Pendergast, but stops as it finds... 

     THE CRATE!  The beast moves to it, clearly surprised.  It pokes at the
     crate carefully, inhales the fragrance and grunts.  The monster seems
     to be struggling with itself!  It sniffs the fibers, lifts a few out
     carefully, then SHOVES THE CRATE AWAY HARD.  Then it rises on its
     haunches and squints into the dark.

     On all sides are glowing displays of stuffed buffalo, gazelle, wild
     horses, wolves, giant elk, sabre tooth tigers.  Mbwun moves close to
     one after another.  Suddenly we notice, in the back of one of the
     dioramas... 

     Margo and Pendergast!  They stand frozen, crouching behind mannequins
     of native Americans riding horses across the plains.  The beast sniffs
     RIGHT AT THEIR WINDOW, then turns away.  Confused, it heads back
     towards the Planetarium and slinks from the room.

     INSIDE THE DIORAMA... Pendergast and Margo exchange an astonished look.
     They whisper.

                              PENDERGAST
                    What happened?

                              MARGO
                    Its eyesight is worse than I
                    thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it
                    couldn't smell us through the glass.

                              PENDERGAST
                    It didn't want the fibers.  What does
                    that mean?

                              MARGO
                    I think... it means it's full.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Then it won't go after the others?

                              MARGO
                    No.  It's still hunting, but not for
                    the hormones.

                              PENDERGAST
                    For what?

                              MARGO
                    I think... for the pleasure of the
                    kill.

     INT. HALLWAY - MUSEUM - NIGHT

     Greg, the Mayor, D'Agosta and the others are in a hallway lined with
     at least a dozen vases.  A GREEK VASE has been shoved aside revealing
     the outlines of a door.  Behind is a sloping dark corridor.  The last of
     the thirty-five people pack in.  Greg and D'Agosta cover the corridor.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    That's it, let's go!

     Grim-faced, D'Agosta follows Kawakita as they duck through the
     doorway, shutting it behind them.  The impact rattles the wall and the
     Greek vase falls.

     INT. SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

     Kawakita and D'Agosta reach the bottom and turn to see the Mayor, his
     wife, Dr. Pound and their whole group standing in several feet of
     rushing water.  Lauren is shivering.  Her father has his arm around her
     tight.  Behind them are two corridors, one forking left and the other
     straight.  D'Agosta gets out the walkie talkie, clicks it on.

                              D'AGOSTA
                        (into walkie talkie)
                    Pendergast.  We made it.  You all
                    right?

     INT. DIORAMA - NIGHT

     Pendergast has the plans open as he studies them.  He speaks into the
     walkie talkie.  Margo paces behind him, thinking hard.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We're fine.  Take the left fork
                    behind you.  You'll be in a straight
                    passage.  When the hall forks again
                    in fifty yards go right.  Then radio
                    back.

     INT. SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

     D'Agosta shuts off his walkie talkie.  Everyone's staring at him.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    All right.  Kawakita, cover the rear.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Oh shit.

                              FRANK
                    No, Lieutenant.  He's not a good
                    enough shot.  I'll do it if you take
                    care of my daughter.

     D'Agosta nods.  Frank expertly reloads.  D'Agosta holsters the walkie
     talkie and they plunge down the left hand passage.  Kawakita takes
     charge of Lauren, who is confused and terrified.  The tunnel has a
     slight downhill grade, and the water begins to move faster, tugging at
     everyone's legs.  People slip and slide as they half make their way
     down the hill.  D'Agosta calls behind them.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Damn.  It's getting deep.  See
                    anything?

     ON FRANK... back not far from the first fork.  He looks towards the head
     of the tunnel, calls out... 

                              FRANK
                    You'll be the first to know.

     Frank turns and plunges after the others.  But then suddenly, he stops.

     ON D'AGOSTA... he reaches the second fork and takes a right.  This
     tunnel is narrower and consequently the water is even deeper.  Slimy
     plants hang down and slap at their faces as they push on.  D'Agosta
     pulls out his walkie talkie.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Pendergast?  I made the right hand
                    fork.  We're already in about three
                    feet of water.  Where should we go?

     But before Pendergast can answer, D'Agosta hears the loud report of
     Frank's gun!  Everyone freezes in the darkness.  The walkie talkie
     cackles and D'Agosta shouts!

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Hello!

                              FRANK (OS)
                    Sweet Jesus, help!

     They hear SPLASHING in the water.  Lauren SCREAMS, tries to run back.
     Kawakita grabs her.  There's more thrashing water and then silence.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Frank!  Are you all right!

     D'Agosta starts for Frank but the Mayor catches his arm and holds him.

                              MAYOR
                    It's too late!

     Everyone waits, staring into the darkness.  Still no answer.  Lauren
     SCREAMS AGAIN.

                              LAUREN
                    Dad!

     D'Agosta turns his flashlight on the water.  It's running red!  He spins
     to the Mayor, points down the tunnel.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Run!

     People start to cry and whimper as the Mayor urges them on.  He takes
     charge of Lauren.  Only Greg Kawakita stays with D'Agosta.  They stand
     shoulder to shoulder and completely alone.  Thrashing in the water can
     be heard as the beast comes closer.  There's a low, pleasurable growl!
     Both men lift their guns.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    On three.

     Kawakita nods.  Behind them in the tunnel is total blackness.  Ahead is
     equally dark.  The noise of their friends gets ever fainter.  The water
     now rushes half way up their thighs.  Kawakita's teeth start to
     chatter.  He bites them shut, steadies his gun.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    One... two... 

     Silence as the water murmurs.  D'Agosta holds the count.  A long,
     agonizing moment.  Kawakita takes his eyes away from the tunnel.

                              KAWAKITA
                    I think it's gone.

     Suddenly a HUGE CLAW snakes out of the water right in front of them
     and the beast roars up!  It was beneath the surface, directly before
     them!  The claw closes on D'Agosta and his shot gun goes off.  D'Agosta
     screams as the beast lifts him towards its mouth!

     For one horrible moment, Kawakita is frozen.  Then he leaps forward,
     shoves the barrel of his gun behind D'Agosta, right in the beast's
     open jaws!  He pulls the trigger and the shotgun explodes, the recoil
     throwing him back, ass over tea cups in the water.  With a roar of pain
     the monster drops D'Agosta and retreats in the dark.  D'Agosta grabs
     Kawakita.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I think you took its tonsils out!

     They haul ass down the tunnel, firing behind them as they go.  Ahead is
     another fork.  The group is waiting.  When they see D'Agosta and
     Kawakita, a cheer goes up.

                              MAYOR
                    Which way!

     As he runs up, D'Agosta grabs for his walkie talkie.  The holster IS
     EMPTY, the walkie talkie gone!  Without missing a beat he registers
     what's happened, then covers it up with the next breath.  He points to
     the right as if there's no doubt and says... 

                              D'AGOSTA
                    This way!

     D'Agosta exchanges a look with Kawakita, who understands exactly what
     happened.  As they plunge into the right tunnel, Greg mutters... 

                              KAWAKITA
                    Holy shit.

     INT. HALL OF THE AFRICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT

     Pendergast and Margo come out of the door leading to the back entry to
     the dioramas.  Pendergast holds the walkie talkie, desperate.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Vince?  Can you hear me?  Vince!

     Nothing but static comes in response.  Margo paces in agitation.

                              MARGO
                    We have to try and draw it off!

                              PENDERGAST
                    How?

                              MARGO
                    The answer's right in front of us.

     She points to one of the dioramas.  It shows a bird being stalked by a
     fox.

                              MARGO
                    That's a ptarmigan, feigning a
                    broken wing.  The bird pretends to be
                    injured to draw the fox away from
                    its nest!

                              PENDERGAST
                        (starts running)
                    It's deceptively simple.  Like a
                    Bruckner Symphony or a Matisse.

     Margo heads for the Planetarium, calling... 

                              MARGO
                    Help!  Please someone!  Help!

     They disappear down the hall with the Greek vases, both calling with
     all they've got.

     EXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT

     There are increasing numbers of SWAT vehicles around.  A HELICOPTER
     lands on the roof.  The rescue effort continues to be slowed by rain
     pouring down.  Ippolito is in the thick of the action.  The S.W.A.T.
     commander, JENNINGS, comes over buckling an ammo belt over his
     fatigues.

                              JENNINGS
                    We're ready.  We've got enough
                    firepower to turn a herd of lions
                    into a fine red mist.

                              IPPOLITO
                    Then do it.

     Jennings nods, goes off.  As Ippolito watches the S.W.A.T. team break
     the glass skylights, gets ready to go in.

     INT. HALL OF THE REPTILES - NIGHT

     Jonathan crouches in the staircase at the end of the Hall of the
     Reptiles.  Hobbes is still by his side.  He keeps the gun pointed out
     into the room, his eyes scanning the dark.  He whispers to Hobbes, as
     if to comfort both of them.

                              JONATHAN
                    It's okay, Hobbes.  We'll be all
                    right.  Help has got to come
                    eventually... We'll make it.  We'll be
                    fine.

     Suddenly he sees something.  What appears to be a BODY lying on a glass
     case!  Jonathan pumps his gun, approaches slowly.  The man wears a
     tuxedo, is lying very still.  As we get closer we see it's THE DRUNK
     Kawakita ran into in the stairwell so long ago!  He suddenly HICCUPS.
     Jonathan starts.  Now the man gently snores.  Jonathan moves to him,
     shakes the drunk's shoulder.

                              JONATHAN
                    Hey!  Wake up!

     The man snorts, opens his eyes and frowns.

                              DRUNK
                    Who the hell are you?

                              JONATHAN
                    You first.

     Jonathan helps the drunk off the glass case.  The man's a little
     unsteady as he tugs at his tux.

                              DRUNK
                    I got lost tryin' to find the
                    bathroom.  I was walkin' in circles.
                    I lay down for a nap.  What's going
                    on?

                              JONATHAN
                    You wouldn't believe me if I told
                    you.

     Hobbes has started to wag his tail and tug at the leash to draw
     Jonathan's attention.

                              JONATHAN
                    What is it, boy?

     From above comes the beating of a distant HELICOPTER and then the
     sound of breaking glass.  Hobbes pulls Jonathan back to the staircase.
     Jonathan grins, follows behind with the drunk.

                              DRUNK
                    Where we going?

                              JONATHAN
                    I think we're going home.

     INT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT

     Huge skeletons of Tyrannosaurus, Stegosaurus and Brontosaurus loom in
     the darkness.  Rain is pouring in.  Jonathan, Hobbes and the drunk
     enter, looks up to the sky lights.  A FLASH OF LIGHTING hits,
     illuminating the dinosaurs and a S.W.A.T. team which is descending on
     a series of ropes.  It's a sixty foot drop.  Jonathan steps forward.

                              JONATHAN
                    Hello!  We're over here!

     They run across the long hall and wait as the the men descend.  The
     first one down is Jennings.

                              JENNINGS
                    Are you hurt?

                              JONATHAN
                    We're fine.  I don't know about the
                    people downstairs.  In the Hall of
                    the Heavens.  The basement... you'll
                    need help.  There's a monster down
                    there.

     A sling suspended on ropes is lowered down.

                              JENNINGS
                    The rescue workers will lift you out
                    one at a time.

     Jennings signals to a group of five men, heavily armed and in flack
     jackets.  They prepare to get the drunk out.

     INT. HALL WITH GREEK VASES - NIGHT

     Pendergast and Margo are at the top of the long, narrow shaft.
     Pendergast's flashlight sends a circle of light onto a sheet of black,
     oily water below.  Both of them continue calling, trying to draw off
     the monster.

                              MARGO
                    Help someone!

                              PENDERGAST
                    Oh God!  Help!

     They suddenly hear the sound of splashing.  An updraft rustles their
     clothes.  Margo sniffs the air, turns to Pendergast.

                              MARGO
                    You smell that?

                              PENDERGAST
                    It's coming.  Run.

     INT. SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

     The group has reached another intersection of tunnels.  The left fork
     turns back uphill.  D'Agosta indicates this tunnel.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    At least we'll be dry.

     They all press forward in the low vaulted darkness.  As they move
     steadily upwards the water recedes.  Kawakita's flashlight flickers and
     he bangs it.  It comes on again.

                              KAWAKITA
                    I believe in you a hundred percent,
                    Vince, but that's the second time
                    we've been at that intersection.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Not so loud.

     D'Agosta shines his light forward and they see that the shaft ends in
     a large round PIPE.

                              KAWAKITA
                    What's that?

                              D'AGOSTA
                    All right everybody, hold up!

     Kawakita and D'Agosta move past the shivering people who are strung
     out along the sides of the tunnel.  D'Agosta touches each person as he
     passes.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    We don't know what's in there.  Let
                    me go first.

     INT. PIPE - NIGHT

     The Mayor follows behind with the group as Kawakita and D'Agosta lead
     the way.  The pipe is dry and rusted.  They move forward with stealth.
     In twenty feet the pipe ends abruptly in darkness.  D'Agosta steps out
     first.

     INT. CAVERN - NIGHT

     The group huddles at the mouth of the pipe, confused, as D'Agosta pans
     his flashlight around the huge space.  The walls are carved out of dirt
     and rounded like a cave.  From the ceiling hang huge cobwebs.  There's a
     large pile of sticks in one corner fashioned rather like a bed.  On a
     mound of dirt beside this bed rests a battered duffel bag.

     Greg moves to it, shines his light on the side.  A name is written in
     marker.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What does it say?

                              KAWAKITA
                        (looks up, shocked)
                    Dr. John Whittlesley.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    What's that doing here?

                              KAWAKITA
                    I don't know.  I thought Dr.
                    Whittlesley died in South America.

                              MAYOR
                        (interrupts)
                    Look.  There's a ladder at the end.  I
                    think it goes up to the street!

     They move forward into the darkness eagerly, towards the ladder which
     leads up to a manhole.  But as they pass the bed of twigs, something
     loud CRUNCHES underfoot.

                              KAWAKITA
                    What is that?

     D'Agosta shines his light down and everyone freezes.  Then one woman
     SCREAMS!

     The wide dirt floor around them is carpeted in clean white BONES!  The
     HUMMING noise is louder and we see its source.  Atop the bones is the
     body of CUTHBERT!  It's covered with BLACK DERMESTID BEETLES.  They're
     stripping the skeleton clean, devouring the flesh!

     The group panics and breaks for the ladder.  Kawakita and D'Agosta once
     more guard the rear.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?

                              D'AGOSTA
                    I'd say we're in its home.

     INT. HALL OF THE NORTHWEST COAST INDIANS - NIGHT

     Pendergast and Margo run down the long dark room, passing an enormous
     hollowed-out canoe.  As they exit the far end, the dark shape of Mbwun
     emerges.  It leaps forward, closing in fast.

     INT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT

     Margo and Pendergast enter a series of maze-like room with hidden
     corners, nooks and crannies with cases full of esoteric Buddhist and
     Japanese Art.  They're running through the twists and turns as fast as
     they can.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We're not going to make the storage
                    room!

                              MARGO
                    Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's
                    DNA is part homo sapien.  In
                    primates, the eye is a direct path
                    to the brain!  If you get a clean
                    shot, there's only one place you can
                    kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!

     AT THIS THEY ROUND A CORNER AND MBWUN LEAPS OUT!  It circled ahead and
     was waiting in front of them!  The animal swipes at Margo and
     Pendergast.  The force of the monster's blow sends Margo reeling and
     slams Pendergast into the wall.  He falls, crumples and drops his gun!
     The case beside him SHATTERS spewing relics, as Mbwun pushes past.
     Pendergast groans and gets to his knees with difficulty.

     MARGO is frantically crawling away in the dark!  The beast makes a low
     sound of pleasure and reaches out one claw, easily pins her down.
     Pendergast looks frantically for any kind of weapon!

     ON MARGO now PINNED BENEATH the heaving body of the monster!
     Powerless, she looks up into the horrible face of death as Mbwun
     raises an enormous claw!  Pendergast, desperate, cries out --

                              PENDERGAST
                    Please, no!  Don't hurt Margo!

     Oddly enough, the beast pauses for once.  Talking to the damn thing is
     the one tactic no one has tried!  The claw halts in mid-air.  The beast
     blinks once and looks from Pendergast to Margo.  Margo sees a flash of
     something unexpectedly HUMANin its eyes!  In astonishment, she
     whispers... 

                              MARGO
                    My God.  You understand.

     As they stare, amazed, imperceptibly, the beast appears to narrow its
     eyes in response!  Margo controls her voice, keeps it even.

                              MARGO
                    Please let me go.  We won't hurt you.

     A strange noise comes out of the monster.  A low, confused growl.  He
     doesn't loosen his grip on Margo, but he leans down to look at her
     closer with one green, unblinking eye.

     She struggles not to turn away in revulsion.  His enormous jaws are
     right near her throat.  Everything is very still.  And then... 

     A BARRAGE OF FIRE breaks out!  The S.W.A.T. team is in the doorway,
     laying down everything they've got.  The creature ROARS as if betrayed,
     leaves Margo and LEAPS UP.  It barrels down on the S.W.A.T. team, picks
     up Jennings and SPIKES HIM TO THE GROUND.  Jennings hits the floor with
     his neck at a crazy angle.  It snaps like a twig.  The other men drop
     back.  Mbwun follows, tearing through the men, cutting a deathly swath!

     Pendergast moves to help the S.W.A.T. team.  Margo struggles to her
     feet and her hand touches the wall.  Beside her is a FIRE HOSE in a
     cabinet!  In a split second Margo hauls it out, throws a switch and
     gets a BLAST OF WATER.  She turns it on the beast as it grabs for
     Pendergast.  The force of the water is enormous.  It pushes the monster
     out the end of the hall.

     Pendergast runs towards her, takes the hose and holds it.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Run!

     She takes off blindly in the maze-like room.  From somewhere behind her
     she hears a horrible HOWL.

     ON MARGO... as she twists and turns through the rows of display cases,
     tearing blindly in the dark.  Ahead is a door.  She dives through it and
     finds she's in... 

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - MUSEUM - NIGHT

     A row of mirrors and urinals line the wall.  It's a huge room, designed
     to handle crowds of visitors.  Margo ducks into one of the stalls as
     MBWUN crashes in.  Margo looks through a crack in the door to see... 

     THE ANIMAL AT FULL STOP.  IT'S STARING AT ITSELF IN THE ROW OF MIRRORS!
     The sight appalls it and the beast lets out a hideous sound!  The claws
     lash out, breaking every mirror in the place, littering the floor with
     glass!

     Then the beast turns and backs up, groaning, as if cornered.  Margo
     sees now that one limb is dragging, leaving a trail of blood.  The
     mouth, too, appears to be bleeding.  The S.W.A.T. team's bullets had an
     affect.

     Margo presses back in the stall, bracing as the beast gets closer.
     It's just outside.  It sniffs the air once and suddenly turns, rears
     up, furious and crashes through the bathroom door.  Margo screams and
     the thing grabs her!  It holds Margo up before it and roars.  It closes
     its massive claws around her as if she is somehow responsible for
     everything.  The claws tighten!  She struggles and fights to no purpose
     ... but then the beast pauses... it's seen something!

     THE NECKLACE WITH TWO ARROWS AROUND HER NECK!

     It stops and its grip loosens!  A pained look flashes across its
     bestial face... 

     And in that split moment Margo looks down... 

     A NECKLACE OF SILVER gleams around the beast's throat too!  The
     necklace is the twin to her own!

     ON MARGO... Can it be possible?  She stares at the thing... 

                              MARGO
                    John's necklace!  You killed him!

     Incredibly the beast shakes its head.  A noise comes from it... a sad
     noise, like a groan.  And now Margo gets it!  She can hardly believe it.
     Her eyes widen in astonishment.  She whispers... 

                              MARGO
                    Oh Jesus.  John?

     The name is a knife through the monster's heart!

                              MARGO
                    No.  It's not possible!

     The last piece of the puzzle falls.  The monster is John Whittlesley!
     Margo, still desperately frightened, tries to keep control.

                              MARGO
                    John?  If it is you... I can help.

     The monster shakes its head no and releases her.  As she watches he
     moves away, quickly limps out the door.

     INT. HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT

     Mbwun now drags himself across the grey carpet, headed for the stairs.
     In the darkness of the hall of Asian Peoples, Pendergast is waiting.
     He lifts one of the S.W.A.T. team rifles which he holds in his hands.
     He aims, is about to fire, but then Margo comes up behind him.

                              MARGO
                    No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you
                    were right.  It's John!

                              PENDERGAST
                    What?

                              MARGO
                    That thing is John Whittlesley.  I
                    should have seen it before!  The
                    fibers are infected with a virus.
                    You eat them, and the virus alters
                    your DNA!  He became addicted to them
                    in South America, followed the
                    plants back to the states.  He
                    probably entered the country as a
                    man.  It would have taken several
                    months for the change to take place.
                    That's how he got from the boat to
                    the museum!

     Pendergast looks over and sees the monster.  His eyes show disbelief.
     Mbwun looks back at both of them briefly, then it disappears up the
     stairs.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I don't believe it.

                              MARGO
                    You have to!  Listen!  All viruses
                    pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the
                    cells of the host to make more
                    viruses!  This one was different.  It
                    inserted a whole array of genes into
                    John.  Reptile genes, sixty five
                    million years old.  Those genes
                    remade him!  It's not his fault!

                              PENDERGAST
                    Whatever that thing is, we have to
                    kill it!

     Margo tries to stop him, but he shrugs her off.

     EXT. MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT

     A helicopter hovers outside pouring a circle of light down on the
     roof.  Ippolito watches as the drunk is pulled up through the hall in a
     sling.  Waters approaches, holding the walkie talkie.

                              WATERS
                    We can't raise the S.W.A.T. team.  No
                    one's answering!  What do you want to
                    do?

     Ippolito eyes are fixed on the room below them.

                              IPPOLITO
                    Holy shit.  Pull him up.

     Lightning throws horrible shadows of the hulking dinosaur skeletons
     all around as MBWUN LIMPS INTO THE HALL!  The men on the roof stare
     down astonished.  Their mouths hang open at the sight!

                              IPPOLITO
                    Get more guns!  Now!

     The men get the drunk up and abandon the sling, leaving Jonathan
     trapped below.

     INT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT

     Jonathan and Hobbes take cover behind one of the dinosaurs and hide.
     Mbwun sees Jonathan, lifts both claws, SWINGS at the skeleton, sending
     it crashing down!  Jonathan SCREAMS, Hobbes is caught and falls.  He
     scrambles into a corner, whimpering, as Pendergast and Margo appear in
     the door.  Fifteen more S.W.A.T. team members with rifles now line the
     hole in the roof.  They all point their guns at Mbwun.

                              IPPOLITO
                    Get back!  We're going to shoot!

     Now Margo runs forward.

                              MARGO
                    No.  Wait!  Let me talk to him first!

                              IPPOLITO
                        (screaming)
                    Kill that thing!  Kill it now!

                              MARGO
                    No!

     MBWUN... turns and sees Margo.  She speaks desperately.

                              MARGO
                    John... you can give up now!  Just lie
                    down where you are!

     Mbwun seems to consider for a moment, but then its eyes gleam and it
     ROARS.  With renewed vigor it leaps to the wall and starts to WALK UP
     IT like a GECKO, ON ALL FOURS!  ON THE ROOF... 

     Some of the S.W.A.T. team fall back in terror!  Now that the monster is
     on the wall it's out of range of their fire!

                              WATERS
                    Holy shit it's coming this way!

                              IPPOLITO
                    It's headed for the roof.  Run!

     Ippolito turns and takes off once more in sheer terror.  Astonished,
     Waters tries to regain control.

                              WATERS
                    Get back here, you asshole!  We can't
                    let it get out!
                        (to the S.W.A.T. team)
                    Surround the opening and kill it!

     But the men are terrified, retreating like Ippolito.  Waters shouts.

                              WATERS
                    Back, everybody!  That's an order!

     But the team is in chaos and losing precious time.

     INT. HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT

     The MONSTER is now half way up the wall.  Margo is distraught, crying.
     Her cool demeanor is cracked.  Pendergast is with her.  She shakes her
     head.

                              MARGO
                    Just like John.  He won't listen.

                              PENDERGAST
                    I have to shoot.

                              MARGO
                    Do it, quickly.  Please.  Aim for the
                    eye.

     Pendergast raises a HIGH POWERED RIFLE with a laser sight.  He aims the
     red laser beam directly at Mbwun's left eye.

                              PENDERGAST
                    He has to look here or I won't get a
                    clear shot.  Call him, Margo.

                              MARGO
                    I can't!

                              PENDERGAST
                    You have to.  Do it now!

     Margo takes a moment, her eyes streaming.  She has no choice, she calls
     out.

                              MARGO
                    John!  John, look at me!

     The beast looks down, sees Pendergast's rifle.  There's a long, awful,
     moment.  Suddenly it emits a sound like a wail.

     ON JONATHAN... staring, stunned.

     PENDERGAST... steady... 

     MARGO... She's crying as she raises her arm as if to say good-bye.

     And the gun EXPLODES.

     ON MBWUN... its head shoots back in pain, and it falls... sixty feet
     straight down to the ground.  Silence.  Thunder rolls.

     It's over.  Pendergast turns to Margo and quietly folds her in his
     arms.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

     There are cops and journalists, ambulances, and medivacs all over the
     place.  Greg Kawakita, wet and bedraggled as a rat, runs up from
     Columbus Ave.  Behind him the Mayor and D'Agosta help the rest of the
     company to the ambulances.

     Waters is on the steps of the museum, helping to organize the rescue
     efforts as Kawakita runs up to Pendergast.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Margo Green.  Have you seen her?

                              PENDERGAST
                    She's over here.

     Greg turns to see Margo come out of the Rotunda with Frock, Jonathan
     and Hobbes.  Her face is devastated.  He moves to her side.  She reacts
     as she sees him, and teacher and pupil hug.

     D'AGOSTA is lost in the swirl of people.  And he likes it like that.  He
     rests against a large stone lion, pulls out a cheap cigar in
     cellophane, unwraps it carefully and tries to light it with a wet
     match.

     He's struggling hopelessly.  Finally he tosses the useless pack of
     matches, sighs.  But then a flame lowers right before his face.  He
     looks up to see Pendergast holding a silver engraved lighter.  D'Agosta
     smiles, takes a nice long hit.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Nice to see you, Lieutenant.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    The sub-basement, huh?  Great idea.

     We go to a wide shot of the museum as we slowly pull back... 

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DAY - SUPER TITLE: SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

     Christmas decorations are up.  A light snow is falling.  There is a very
     long line.

     INT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - GIFT SHOP - DAY

     All the registers are doing a booming business.  People are buying
     Mbwun posters, t-shirts and hats.

     INT. SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - DAY

     School tours, old ladies, parents and children, foreign tourists with
     cameras snake through the displays.  In the room with the Relic,
     there's a tremendous crowd.

     INT. MARGO'S LABORATORY - DAY

     Margo closes her computer, looks out a window at the falling snow.  She
     turns and walks into the back office.  Kawakita is working there alone.
     His fly-fishing rod stands in the corner, untouched.  Margo goes to it,
     smiles softly.

                              MARGO
                    No time for fishing anymore?

     Greg looks up from his work and smiles.

                              KAWAKITA
                    Got to finish this thesis sometime.

                              MARGO
                    How about lunch?

                              KAWAKITA
                    Not today.  Besides, I think the
                    director of the museum is expecting
                    you.

                              MARGO
                    Okay.

     Margo exits.  Greg returns to his work.

     INT. HALLWAYS - MUSEUM - DAY

     Margo heads down the hall to the Director's office.  She walks through
     the new double oak doors to find DR. FROCK seated at Cuthbert's old
     desk.

                              MARGO
                    Dr. Frock?

                              FROCK
                    Look who's here, Margo.

     PENDERGAST and D'AGOSTA rise out of two high-backed chairs.  Margo
     smiles for the first time, takes Pendergast's hands.

                              MARGO
                    I'm so glad to see you.  What's the
                    occasion?

                              PENDERGAST
                    I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to
                    see Vince and we thought we'd see
                    the new display.

     INT. HALL OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - DAY

     Margo, Pendergast, and D'Agosta follow Frock past the familiar
     dioramas.

                              PENDERGAST
                    Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What
                    happened to the rest of
                    Whittlesley's plants?

                              FROCK
                    They were sent to the Center For
                    Disease Control in Atlanta.

                              D'AGOSTA
                    Shouldn't a drug that powerful be
                    destroyed?

                              FROCK
                    The virus itself might have positive
                    applications.  They'll keep the
                    plants in secure lock up while the
                    studies are made.
                        (beat)
                    Greg isn't joining us?

                              MARGO
                    He's changed.  He's always working on
                    his thesis.  He comes in early, stays
                    late.  I tried to get him to join us,
                    but he never takes a break.

     They pause on a NEW DIORAMA.  It's huge, filling one entire end of the
     hall.  In the center is a life-sized representation of MBWUN standing
     on the tepui amid the plants.  Behind is a painting of John Whittlesley
     as he once was.  He wears the necklace with the two arrows, of silver
     and gold.  As Margo looks, she touches her own.  Pendergast turns to
     her, sympathy in his eyes.

                              PENDERGAST
                    We did the right thing, Margo.

     Margo smiles warmly.

                              MARGO
                    Yes.  I know.

     INT. MARGO'S LABS - DAY

     Greg Kawakita wears gloves, high powered glasses, works in solitude in
     the lab.  Suddenly he stands up, throws off the glasses, then he sits
     down again.  He seems to be struggling with himself.  He glances over
     his shoulder to make sure he's alone.  Quickly he moves to a locked
     drawer.  He opens it with a key from his pocket and takes out a small
     envelope, looks inside.

     INSERT... the envelope is full of the PLANT FIBERS!  Greg has managed to
     keep his own cache!

     Moving quickly, with jerky motions, he lays one fiber down on a slide
     with a shaking hand.  With an exacto knife, he cuts off a tiny sliver,
     pops it into his mouth.  He closes his eyes in ecstasy and savors the
     taste.  Then he cuts one more infinitesimal sliver, leaves it on the
     slide.  He takes a deep breath, returns the envelope to the drawer.  He
     turns the key carefully and we GO CLOSE ON HIS HAND... 

     On the back is A ROW OF SCALES...

	PRESENTATION CREDITS appear... then FADE...
	
	Out of BLACK... SHOCK CUT TO:
	
	INT   LAB   "A" LEVEL   TIMELESS
	
	A MAN'S FACE, filling the screen.
	
				MARCUS (filter)
			Stay away from here!
	
	We're watching A VIDEO MONITOR. A pre-recorded tape shows
	a view of what is obviously a pristine-RESEARCH LABORATORY.
	DR. JOHN MARCUS, in a lab coat, faces THE CAMERA, disheveled
	and looking like a madman.
	
				MARCUS (cont. filter)
			This lab must remain sealed!
	
	INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	Overhead lamps cast pools of LIGHT down onto A CONFERENCE
	TABLE, onto THE HANDS of PEOPLE assembled to observe the
	video. We see NO FACES. But expensive WATCHES, sleeves
	with high-ranking STRIPES, indicate wealth, power, and a
	military presence.
	
	THE VIDEO: On the wall behind MARCUS, we see SHADOWS darting
	frantically. We hear VOICES rising in panic.
	
				MARCUS (cont. Filter)
			For God's sake, don't come in!
	
	The CAMERA is SWATTED by A HAND that lurches suddenly into
	the foreground. We only see it for a few video frames, but
	we might subliminally notice LESIONS on the flesh. The IMAGE
	SWIRLS wildly. The next clear picture we see... is of the
	same laboratory...topsy-turvy. THE CAMERA is lying on its
	side on the floor.
	
				VOICE IN THE ROOM (o.s.)
			Look.  Here.
	
	A LASER POINTER casts a RED DOT on a corner of the video
	screen, indicating A HUNCHED FIGURE, leaning over A HUMAN
	BODY, apparently ...feeding! With a GRUNT, the figure turns.
	and LUNGES, it's face covered with BLOOD, at the CAMERA. The
	image SWIRLS again, and the SCREEN GOES BLACK. With a MUSIC
	STING, a single TITLE appears, full across the blackness...
	
			        RESIDENT EVIL
	
	
	Pg-2
	
	EXT  FOREST LAND   PRE-DAWN
	
	A DARK SKY ...and in the foreground, profiled against a FULL
	MOON, A DARK FACE ...watching the heavens with piercing black
	eyes, alert, though not predatory. This is CHRIS REDFIELD,
	young, handsome. More than simply an outdoor type, he seems
	perfectly in place, almost part of the environment.
	
	A band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of
	magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. Sitting
	on a ridge, squinting into that band of light, Chris sees ...
	
	...AN EAGLE coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through
	the hilltops. As the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes
	recognizable. Chris smiles and jots a note on a pad.
	
	The regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly...
	a freshwater trout lies flapping, three-thousand feet above
	the highest water.
	
				CHRIS
			Take it, Goliath. It's yours.
	
	"Goliath" snaps up the fish and flies away with it.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			See ya next year, guy.
	
	Chris reaches into a water-filled bucket, pulls out another
	trout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious
	Cliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the-same high rock.
	ANOTHER EAGLE, smaller, a female, appears in the sky.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Cleopatra.
	
	Chris scrambles back to his place and jots another note.
	
	"Cleopatra" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down.
	She's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she
	recoils and climbs again, hovering.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Come on. Come on down.
	
	The eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning. It makes another
	dive, but stops short again.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			What's the matter, beautiful?
	
	The bird seems frightened.  Of what? It makes one more dive.
	Gets very close to the fish... but suddenly SHRIEKS and peels,
	away from the rock. Chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as
	it soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair.
	
	
	Pg-3
	
	CLOSE ON: CHRIS, concerned, as he watches the eagle disappear
	over the hills.
	
	Over his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the
	fish. It's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight
	catches SOMETHING MOVING there. Something that lets out a
	sharp INHUMAN SOUND.
	
	Chris whirls around. There's nothing on the rock. Nothing
	at all. The fish has been taken.
	
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   DAWN
	
	CHRIS walks into a characterless apartment. He quietly
	sheds his clothes. Even in silhouette, we can see that his
	body is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight.
	Moving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases
	himself into a bed where...
	
	...a beautiful young girl, JILL VALENTINE, seems to be fast
	asleep. As Chris nestles in beside her, we see that her
	eyes, facing away, are open. Chris gently drapes an arm
	around her and lets his body relax.
	
				CHRIS
			(A whisper) Glad you're still 
			here, lady
	
				JILL
			It's my apartment.
	
				CHRIS
			(Surprised) You're awake.
	
				JILL
			I've been awake. Since you left.
	
				CHRIS
			Sorry.
	
	His apology goes no further. He's still troubled by what
	happened in the hills.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			There was... something wrong.
	
				JILL
			What, with my dinner? I never had
			a mother. I'll learn.
	
	Chris smiles politely. He offers...
	
				CHRIS
			I'll do the cooking.
	
	
	Pg-4
	
	...but he can't switch focus.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			On the mountain...there...must
			have been something... prowling
			around up there.
	
				JILL
			There are probably all kinds of
			things prowling around up there.
			In the middle of the night.
	
	Chris apologizes again, this time more sincerely.
	
				CHRIS
			I'm sorry. Really. You...have to
			be there at dawn. They ride the
			wind over the ridge.
	
				JILL
			Dawn? You left at one A.M.
	
				CHRIS
			I had to go fishing. It's the fish
			that bring them down, so I can get
			a close look at them. (Enthused)
			I've tracked a dozen of them, Jill.
			Twelve of those big bruisers. I can
			actually recognize them. I've even
			given them names, over the years.
	
				JILL
			You've been doing this for years?
	
				CHRIS
			Only in the early Autumn. When
			they're' migrating.
	
				JILL
			I'II set the alarm for next. October.
	
	Jill rolls over and faces him.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			I wish I could get excited. Really.
			That's the truth. As excited as you,
			over such... simple things.
	
				CHRIS
			Beauty... isn't simple. If it was...
			I'd be beautiful.
	
				JILL
			You are.
	
	Pg-5
	
				CHRIS
			No, no, no.  I'm simple.  You, on the
			other hand...(nuzzling closer)...have
			all that... stuff... hiding underneath
			somewhere. That's what fascinates me.
	
				JILL
			Fascination. Not love?
	
	Jill is being playful. Chris, taking her question to heart,
	becomes introspective.
	
				CHRIS
			I... honestly don't know. I guess
			I've been... living alone too long.
			You're the first, the only woman I've
			ever thought of as... a real partner.
	
	Now Jill becomes introspective.
	
				JILL
			I've always been...afraid of living
			alone. I've always had... people...
			talking at me... knowing they could
			wind me up and I'd do... (shrug) ...
			whatever they wanted.
	
	Chris looks into her eyes. She kisses him gently.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			We all have... something hidden...
			underneath.  Beauty may not be simple.
			But it's not all that complicated,
			Either.  Most of the time, you find
			It... right in the middle of all the...
			confusion.
	
				CHRIS
			I'm part Mohawk. Indians are never
			confused. At least, they never let
			it show.
	
	They kiss again, this time more passionately. Rolling over,
	they begin to make love.
	
	EXT   FARM   DAWN
	The purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite
	dark when a crusty old farm-hand, RAKE, opens the creaking
	door of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads THREE HORSES
	out into the morning breeze.
	
	Two dogs, A LAB and A SPANIEL, romp at his heels as Rake
	opens a log gate.
	
	Pg-6
	-
	Two of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large
	corral. The third, a beautiful stallion, resists, snorting,
	tossing its head in high spirit.
	
				RAKE
			Get in there, Lucky. Quit horsin'
			around. Get in.
	
	"LUCKY" moves into the corral, strutting proudly.
	
				RAKE (cont.)
			Swear. If I didn't know you was
			just an animal, I'd say you was all
			full of yourself. GET IN THERE!
	
	Rake waves his flashlight, not meanly, there is clearly a
	great deal of affection here. Rake shuts the gate behind
	the stallion, who begins to gallop around happily inside
	the fence. All seems lovely, until...
	
	...the dogs suddenly go on point. Their ears perk. They
	sniff the air...and begin to WHINE.
	
				RAKE (cont.)
			What's wrong with you two?
	
	KER-RAAKK! A startling SOUND. Rake turns to find Lucky and
	the other horses, their eyes flaring, trying to KICK their
	way out of the fencing. They seem terrified.
	
	CUT TO :
	
	A WIDE SHOT:  of RAKE, and the frightened ANIMALS, from
	two hundred yards away. THE CAMERA MOVES IN, slowly at
	first, then gaining speed... extraordinary SPEED. We are
	seeing THROUGH THE EYES OF... whatever it is that's running,
	charging, SLATHERING HUNGRILY...
	
	...reaching the corral, DARTING through the fence, past the
	KICKING HORSES, and LEAPING at Rake, who whirls around...and
	CRIES OUT in pain as his flashlight BLINDS us with WHITENESS.
	
	EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
	
	The WHITENESS becomes the GLARE of HALOGEN LIGHTS. We are
	overwhelmed by the SOUND of AIRCRAFT ENGINES. We see MEN,
	armed SOLDIERS, scrambling into combat HELICOPTERS.
	
	A RADIO MAN runs right toward THE CAMERA, holding out an
	open receiver.
	
				RADIO MAN
			Top brass, sir!
	
	
	Pg-7
	
	ANOTHER MAN, in the foreground, takes the radio-phone. We
	can't see his face. Only his forearm, which bears A TATTOO
	of a grinning SKULL.
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO
			Alpha Leader.
	
				VOICE ON PHONE (o.s. filter)
			How long before you get in there?
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO
			Fifteen minutes.
	
	INT   AN OFFICE   DAWN
	
	A SUIT talks on a red telephone. Once again, we see no face.
	An ostentatious diamond RING kicks light as the man snips off
	the end off a Monte Cristo.
	
				MAN WITH RING
			You're good, soldier. But not that
			good. It's five hundred miles away.
			In the backwoods of Pennsylvania.
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO (o.s. filter)
			We have troopers on site. A first-
			strike force. Under cover.
	
	The flame from a wooden match lights the Monte Cristo.
	
				MAN WITH RING
			Very resourceful.  You have my
			permission activate them.
	
	EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO
			I've already done that. You have my
			permission... to say that you gave me
			permission.
	
	THE TATTOOED MAN runs off to join the other SOLDIERS.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	CHRIS sleeps. JILL is awake, deep in thought, when...
	
	...BRRRRT! It's not a ring, it's a vibration. Jill reaches
	down and extracts something small and black, the size of a
	box of Tic-Tacs, from one of her shoes. She gets out of bed,
	checking to see that Chris is still asleep, and moves into...
	
	
	Pg-8
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   BATHROOM   MORNING
	
	...a bathroom. Closing the door behind her, she puts the
	small box to her ear, extracts a wire from it, with a tiny
	microphone on its tip, and...
	
				JILL
			(Softly) Valentine.
	
	We can't hear the voice that speaks to her.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			If this is just another a drill,
			I'll strangle you. (She listens)
			Shit. Give me the activation code.
	
	JILL pulls a small ENVELOPE from a toiletry bag. She breaks
	open a wax seal...and takes out a thick paper on which is
	printed... 29-RC-6735.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			(Gaping, not believing) Th-that's
			a match. (Beat) I'm on my way.
	
	Jill clicks off. She dumps something else from the envelope
	into her hand... A BLUE PLASTIC CARD, the size of a Visa,
	blank except for a mag-stripe. There's a small hole in one
	corner, through which a chain is strung. Jill slings the
	chain over head, wearing the blue card like a pendant.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	CHRIS is still asleep. JILL comes out of the bathroom and
	looks down at him longingly.  Should she wake him?  Tell him
	what's happening?  She wants to, but duty prevents it.  She
	pulls herself away.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   CLOSET   MORNING
	
	TCHIK TCHIK TCHIK...JILL pushes aside hangers which hold her
	clothes. She types numbers into a hidden KEYPAD. A SECRET
	PANEL OPENS, revealing a CLOSET WITHIN THE CLOSET, packed
	with COMBAT UNIFORMS and WEAPONS.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	The sound... TCHUNG... of the front door closing snaps CHRIS
	awake.  His first thought is for his lover.  He reaches out
	and finds that... she's not in bed.  He jumps up, rushes to
	a window, looks down, from the second story, and sees...
	
	
	Pg-9
	
	EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	...JILL, heavily ARMED, in UNIFORM, wearing a beret that has
	an insignia... S.T.A.R.S. She rushes down the front path and
	jumps into A HUMMER with THREE OTHER TROOPERS on board. The
	vehicle pulls instantly away...
	
	...leaving Chris, looking through the window, puzzled, angry,
	and very much wounded.
	
	
	INT/EXT   HUMMER   MORNING
	
	RUSSO drives. WILLIAMS and DISIMONE sit in the back, all
	tough Special-Forces types. JILL, in the front passenger
	seat, though the only female, ranks the highest.
	
				DISIMONE
			Another practice run, right?
	
				RUSSO
			We been practicin' six months!
			For what?
	
				JILL
			For this. This is the real deal.
	
				WILLIAMS
			Honest to God?
	
				JILL
			Based on my experience, Williams,
			God isn't always honest
	
				DISIMONE
			Where we goin'?
	
				JILL
			In there.
	
	Jill points into THE ARKLEY FOREST which lies ahead. Miles
	of old growth-trees shrouded in a ghostly morning mist.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	EXT   THE FOREST   MORNING
	
	DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE MIST... THE HUMMER bounces over
	non-roads and stops fifty yards from...
	
	...A PAIR OF IRON GATES, each wrought with the letter "A".
	Beyond, the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of...
	A MANSION.  Huge.  Like Xandau.  THE TROOPERS, amazed,
	climb out and approach the gates.
	
	Pg-10
	
				RUSSO
			If you had the jing to build a place
			like this, would you build it in the
			middle of fuckin' nowhere?
	
				WILLIAMS
			Paris.
	
				DISIMONE
			Manhattan. Upper west.
	
				JILL
			(Wistfully) Some people prefer...
			a quiet life. (Back to business)
			Our orders are to secure the area.
	
				DISIMONE
			From what? This area's been 'secure'
			since the French and Indian War!
	
	A deep, animal SNARL comes from the woods.  The troopers
	raise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush.  The
	fog keeps sunlight from penetrating.  The forest is a maze
	of dark shadows. Leaves flutter.  Limbs SNAP.  Then...
	
	DARK SHAPES can be seen moving, circling.  A half-dozen
	of them.  Maybe more.  Jill whips out a transmitter and
	quickly types an access code.
	
				JILL
			(Into radio) This is Valentine,
			Bravo Team. We, er... we might be
			in trouble, here.
	
	KRITCH! Something LEAPS out of the brush. Automatic
	WEAPONS SPIT reflexively.
	
	KRITCH KRITCH KRITCH...more lunging SHAES appear. The
	troopers scatter, firing, as they are attacked from all
	sides. Jill dives for the shrubbery, shouting into her
	transmitter.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			WE ARE IN TROUBLE!
	
	CUT TO :
	
	INT   HUEY   MORNING
	
	JILL'S VOICE stutters over a headset which is pressed against
	A MAN'S EAR.
	
				JILL (o.s. filter)
			Under attack... by.. .assailants...
			Unidentifi...
	
	Pg-11
	
	Static. Hissing air. The SHOT WIDENS as the man lowers his
	headset. First we see the TATTOO on his arm... a grinning
	SKULL which we recognize. Then, gradually, we see his face.
	Lean and mean, wearing dark sunglasses, this is ALBERT
	WESKER, a hard-assed career officer.
	
				WESKER
			Can you get a trace?
	
	The pilot, LAGUARDIA, responds.
	
				LAGUARDIA
			Lost the beacon. It just cut out.
			Like it was...swallowed by something.
	
	Oddly, Wesker smiles.
	
				WESKER
			I do believe, gentlemen...that we're
			gonna be earning some combat pay.
	
	There are three other MEN on board. The closest to Wesker
	is BARRY BURTON, a muscular black man, as big as a grizzly,
	with the heart of a Teddy.
	
				BARRY
			Damn, if you don't love a fight.
	
				WESKER
			Hey, if I didn't... you'd be a dead
			man. (To the pilot) Call in a nine-
			nine. I want Raccoon City e-vacked.
	
	Wesker and the men fly from the lens.  THE CAMERA passes
	Out through one of the helicopter's windows as the chopper soars
	away.  When the SHOT WIDENS, we see OTHER HUEYS...black,
	unmarked, keeping formation.  Three... six...ten of them.
	
	EXT   FOREST   MORNING
	
	GUNS BLAZE. THE TROOPERS are under assault by thrashing,
	inhuman SHAPES...GROWLING, SNAPPING. JILL rolls into a
	natural trench.  DISIMONE is behind her, WILLIAMS is
	crawling just ahead, his legs pumping.  Jill scoots past
	him and sees that...
	
	...those legs aren't moving on their own.  They've been
	RIPPED AWAY FROM WILLIAMS' TORSO and are being dragged into
	the underbrush by some... BEAST... concealed in the thick
	brush, so we never get a clear look at it.
	
	OTHER BEASTS attack DiSimone.  Then Russo.  We see only
	details.  Jill fires her pistol, point blank... to no avail.
	RED-RIMMED EYES, SNARLING JAWS, DROOLING TEETH descend on
	her as we CUT TO:
	
	
	Pg-12
	
	EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT BUILDING   MORNING
	
	CHRIS steps out of Jill's building. Suddenly, incongruously,
	camo-painted HUEYS swoop down out of the sky.
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   MAIN STREET   MORNING
	
	THE CHOPPERS land where they can. COMMANDOS leap out and
	begin to cordon off the town.  Bullhorns blare.
	
	BULLHORN
	There's been an accident in the
	hills nearby. A military aircraft,
	carrying live weapons, has crashed...
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   SIDE STREET   MORNING
	
	CHRIS runs down a side-street into AN ALLEY, where he's
	trapped by COMMANDOS, both in front and behind.
	
				SOLDIER
			Let's go, hayseed. (Aiming his M-16)
			You gonna be a good boy?
	
	Chris swallows his fury. Gritting his teeth, he goes along
	with the soldiers, prodded, by rifle barrels, out onto...
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY  MAIN STREET   MORNING
	
	...Main Street, where there is CHAOS... an Orwellian sight,
	as CITIZENS find themselves horded into helicopters and
	TRUCKS from the local National Guard Post.
	
	A sweating man, still in his pajamas, rushes up to the
	SOLDIERS that are escorting CHRIS.
	
				MAN
			Look here, I'm the Sheriff of this...
	
				SOLDIER
			Step aside.
	
				SHERIFF
			But, I'm the Sheriff! An ex-Army man, like you.
	
				BULLHORN (o.s.)
			There is no immediate danger, but
			as a precaution, we are evacuating
			the area. You will be provided
			shelter until the weapons have been
			removed from the crash site.
	
	Pg-13
	
				SHERRIFF
			That's a worn-out scenario. If
			a plane crashed nearby, don't you
			think somebody would have heard
			it go down? Tell us the truth,
			guys. What's this really about?
	
				SOLDIER
			I said, STEP ASIDE!
	
	The soldier lifts his rifle. He's about to CLUB the sheriff
	when Chris lunges, grabbing his arm. WHOOMPH! Chris kicks
	the soldier in the balls. The man buckles. Chris bolts.
	
	One of the other commandos FIRES at him, a loud BURST which
	misses Chris but SHATTERS a shop window, setting off wild
	PANIC on the street. Chris ducks into a building...
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   BACK STREET   MORNING
	
	...and out a rear door. He runs through a warren of back
	alleyways, arriving at...
	
	...A JEEP SAHARA which is parked behind Jill's apartment
	building. He jumps in without opening the door, jams the key
	into the ignition, and ROARS off.
	
	INT   HUEY   MORNING
	
	Still airborne, in one of the black helicopters that have yet
	to reach the site, WESKER barks orders into a radio.
	
				WESKER
			Charlie, David, Edward, proceed to
			Raccoon City. Assist the e-vack.
			I'm going on target with Alpha Team.
			All forces stand ready to support.
	
	EXT   FARM   MORNING
	
	CHRIS rumbles his jeep onto a picturesque FARM, secluded deep
	in the forest. We don't recognize it immediately. It was
	dark when we last saw the place.
	
	Jumping out, Chris sees three large SHAPES lying in the grass
	of a corral. Rushing over, Chris realizes...
	
	...they're HORSES. One of them is LUCKY, his prize
	stallion... DEAD, in a pool of BLOOD, with its belly torn
	open and a huge chunk out of its neck.
	
				CHRIS
			Aw, no... (Devastated) ...L-Lucky.
	
	
	Pg-14
	
	Chris hears a weak, MOANING SOUND. He turns and sees...
	RAKE, lying near a water pump. Chris rushes to the man's
	side and finds him brutally SLASHED, barely clinging to life.
	
				RAKE
			(Coughing blood) They... they come
			outta the trees, Reddy. Don't... don't
			know what they was. Figure... maybe
			some kinda... wolves, or somethin' ...
	
	Examining the man's wounds, Chris realizes they're fatal.
	
				RAKE
			I... I never seen 'em comin'.
	
				CHRIS
			Don't try to talk, Rake.
	
				RAKE (cont.)
			I... ain't... never left this farm...
			untended... since yer daddy first
			took it over.
	
				CHRIS
			I know. You... kept the place runnin'...
			better than me.
	
				RAKE
			I just...never seen 'em comin', Reddy.
			Never even...had a chance to...turn
			a gun on 'em.
	
	There's a THUNDER in the sky. Chris looks up. Wesker's
	Fleet of black HUEYS appears on the horizon.  They split up,
	Seven banking off toward Raccoon City, the remaining three
	grinding ahead over the forest, slowing down, dropping in
	altitude.
	
				CHRIS
			Where are they going? There's
			nothing in there... except...
	
				RAKE
			Y'oughta... remember it... real good.
			I do.  From... when you was a kid.
	
				CHRIS
			The... the old Arkley place?
	
				RAKE
			I remember them days. I surely do...
			Remember them... them old days.
	
	Chris looks back down at the old man, who is drifting,
	starting to lose it.
	
	Pg-15
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			I'm not gonna bullshit you, Rake.
			You're...in a bad time. If there's
			any way to save you, I'll find it,
			I swear. You just... hang in there,
			old guy. I'll be right back.
	
	Chris jumps to his feet and runs into...
	
	INT   FARMHOUSE   MORNING
	
	...the great-room of the FARMHOUSE. Rustic. Cozy. CHRIS
	snatches up a telephone. There's no dial-tone. The line
	is dead. Chris rushes to a gun cabinet and pulls out an old
	WINCHESTER rifle. He scoops ammo from a drawer into a
	shoulder bag and runs back outside...
	
	EXT   FARM   MORNING
	
	...where his eyes catch MOVEMENT in the corral. LUCKY,
	entrails spilling, is trying to stand.
	
				CHRIS
			Oh, God, Rake. Oh, Jesus, the poor thing's still alive.
	
	Chris shoulders his ammo bag, reaches inside, and quickly
	reloads the Winchester. Stepping forward, he aims carefully.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Sorry, old hoss.
	
	
	BLAM!  A clean shot to the horse's brain drops the animal.
	
	It takes Chris a long moment to recover... then, he looks into
	the trees. The helicopters are no longer in sight, but their
	THUNDER remains.  They haven't landed yet.
	
	Chris turns and rushes back to Rake's side, only to find...
	...he has died. Chris' jaws tighten, but he has no time
	to mourn. He closes Rake's eyes. Digs through the grass.
	Pulls up a handful of dirt. Stuffs it into the old man's
	hand, and closes his stiffening fingers over it.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			The earth keeps us.
	
	Conquering his emotions, Chris runs to his jeep and jumps in.
	He shifts into four-wheel-drive and, ignoring the road, heads
	straight over the field for the trees.
	
	As the jeep disappears, THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN, ZOOMING
	IN ON...
	
	Pg-16
	
	...one of the farm dogs. The SPANIEL. Not the entire
	animal, but one of its three SEPARATE PARTS... it's front
	end... CRUSHED head, BLOODY neck, and a single BROKEN paw...
	
	...which is trying to CRAWL.
	
	Fifty yards away, RAKE'S HAND relaxes. The earth spills out
	through his fingers as the dead man's eyes... POP OPEN.
	
	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MORNING
	
	THE FIRST OF THE BLACK HUEYS drops, hazardously, into a
	small clearing with barely enough space. Unable to land
	on the scrub-brush, it hovers ten feet off the ground. Its
	rotors CLIP TREE LEAVES as WESKER, BARRY, and TWO OTHER
	S.T.A.R.S. COMMANDOS jump out, heavily armed. The chopper
	lifts off, placed by HUEY NUMBER TWO.
	
	NOT FAR AWAY, CHRIS navigates through undergrowth until he
	can see THE HELICOPTERS through the trees. The THUNDER from
	their rotors masks the grinding of Chris' jeep. He pulls
	within a hundred yards and, leaving his vehicle in the bush,
	moves closer, cautiously, on foot.
	
	THE THIRD HUEY air-drops TWO MEN and TWO WOMEN in S.T.A.R.S.
	uniforms. There are TWELVE COMMANDOS in all... ALPHA TEAM.
	Wesker looks up at the Huey's PILOT, using his radio to speak
	to the man.
	
				WESKER
			You'll have to rotate or you'll run
			out of fuel, but I want one chopper
			to remain in the air at all times.
			We might need help in a hurry.
	
	A "Roger that", squaks back as the Huey banks away.
	
	Barry looks worried. His instincts are asking... "We might
	need... 'help'".  Against what? We only see this in his eyes,
	he says nothing as...
	
	...Wesker leads the team through the woods, unaware of...
	
	...CHRIS, following behind, crouching around trees and
	bushes, not a trained commando, but comfortable with the
	land, a natural warrior using ancestral instincts.
	
	THE CAMERA TRACKS COMBAT BOOTS as they CRUNCH through the
	low-Lying MIST.. .stopping abruptly when they encounter...
	
	...WEAPONS, AMMO BELTS, bits of SHRDDED UNIFORMS... and
	HUMAN BODY PARTS... strewn all through the surrounding brush,
	remnants of what was obviously a feeding-frenzy.
	
	
	Pg-17
	
				VICKERS
			Holy... Goh... gaah...
	
	BRAD VICKERS vomits. Unarmed, he's Alpha Team's computer-
	techie. Not a combat soldier, he's a bit of a coward.
	
	Another non-combatant, REBECCA CHAMBERS, is the team's
	medical officer. She digs an ammonia capsule from her
	pack and holds it under Vickers' nose.
	
	RICHARD AIKEN and KENNETH SULLIVAN are buddies, regular
	G.I. Joes, right out of every war movie. Aiken stares at
	the carnage, calmly chewing a wad of gum.
	
				AIKEN
			You ever eat road-kill, Sullivan?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken... a guy with a brain your
			size would be better off dead.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (o.s.)
			Want me to shoot ya, Aiken?
	
	ROSIE RODRIGUEZ, a tough, body-built babe steps in.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			I'm ready ta shoot somebody.
	
				ALKEN
			I'll pass. Shoot Sullivan.
	
	FOREST SPEYER, a wiry Willem Defoe type, finds a bloody BERET
	and brings it to Wesker.  There's an I.D. tag on the brim...
	
				WESKER
			(Reading the tag) 'Valentine'. (Beat)
			Radio Washington.  Bravo Team found
			on site. No survivors.
	
	In the bushes, Chris overhears, not wanting to believe. He
	sees Wesker angrily pitch Jill's beret into the brush.
	
				WESKER
			We're goin' in.  Watch your backs.
	
	Wesker advances his troops. When the coast is clear, Chris
	rushes in, picks up the beret, and sees the name tag for
	himself. "Valentine ".
	
	After what happened at the farm... now this... feeling sucker-
	punched, defeated, Chris hangs his head.
	
	One of the HUEYS dips in low.
	
	
	Pg-18
	
	Chris looks up. The sight of the war machine lifts him from
	defeat... to rage.  His eyes are soft, for the last time, as
	he tucks Jill's beret into his pack.  When he looks up again,
	those eyes have become newly predatory.  He ducks out of
	sight as the helicopter swings lower.
	
	Downdraft from the rotors makes the bushes rustle, catching
	Chris' attention.  He realizes that... it's not just the wind.
	The shrubs are being disturbed by...
	
	SOMETHING DARK which is moving through them.  It pokes
	its head out.  A WOLF! Rake was right.  Chris readies his
	Winchester as the animal stalks forward.
	
	It's not a wolf. It's A DOG. Mottled, its flesh gray,
	covered with rotting lesions... and it has three bleeding
	BULLET HOLES in its belly, chest, neck.
	
	GROWRRR!  It LEAPS at Chris... who fires... BLAM!
	
	Up ahead, Wesker and his commandos freeze.
	
				WESKER
			Who fired? WHO FIRED?
	
	Before anyone can answer, the team is ATTACKED by MORE DOGS
	which BURST out of the surrounding woods...DOBERMANS and
	SHEPHERDS... but something is seriously wrong with all of
	them. Their EYES are DEAD, their FLESH decaying.
	
	Automatics piss streams of lead. Hot rounds TEAR through the
	animals, many of the slugs accidentally blowing out brains.
	of his bullets hits its target... one of the dogs' heads.
	
	The commandos are backed up against... the IRON GATES we
	saw earlier. The Arkley Mansion stands beyond.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Let's get inside.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			NO! (Shouting) I WANT 'EM ALL
			DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? STAND FAST...
			UNTIL THEY ARE ALL DEAD !
	
	The dogs don't stand a chance. Alpha Team's firepower is
	overwhelming. But there is a human casualty. JOSEPH FROST
	trips and falls. One of the dogs POUNCES on him, chewing
	out his HEART... through his BACK.
	
	Wesker steps in, RIDDLING the dead man, and the dog, with
	forty rounds from his M-16.
	
	Pg-19
	
	In the next instant, ANOTHER DOG LEAPS at Wesker from behind.
	He hears its snarl... too late.  He dives into the grass...
	too late.  The dog is about to land on him when...
	...it's BLASTED out of mid air by... Barry.
	
				BARRY
			Even-Steven, boss.  You saved my
			ass in the desert.  I saved yours I
			in Pennsylvania.
	
	Wesker stand, straightening his ever-present sunglasses.
	
				WESKER
			I don't believe in being... 'Even-
			Steven' with anybody.  A man saves
			my ass...I pay him back.  Before
			this day is over, I'll pay you back,
			Barry.  Just... stick with me, okay?
	
	Wesker checks his equipment belt. Something is missing.
	He looks to where he rolled in the grass. Using a FLASH-
	LIGHT, he finds...
	
	...a small electronic unit the size of a cell-phone. But
	it's not a cell-phone. Whatever it is... Wesker clips it
	onto his belt.
	
	FROM THE BRUSH, Chris sees all this. The guns have gone
	silent. The attack seems to be over. Chris moves stealthily
	to the body of the animal that he shot. It's wearing a
	COLLAR which reads...
	
				  SPIKE #26
	
	Alongside the I.D., there's a corporate-looking logo... the
	symbol of an UMBRELLA.
	
	GRRROWWWLL! ANOTHER DOG is advancing on Chris. He aims
	his Winchester.  CLICK! The magazine is empty.  No time to
	reload.  The dog is on him.  Chris SCRAMBLES away.  The dog
	BOUNDS after him.
	
	Chris drops to the ground.  Did he trip?  No.  He pushes a
	TREE ROOT, which is FALSE.  It swings open and he dives in,
	pulling the root shut over him.
	
	The dog arrives an instant later.  It lets out an angry
	howl... and is BLOWN AWAY... by RODRIGUEZ, who neither saw
	Chris, nor where he went.
	
	The forest goes dead quiet.  Too quiet.  There's not even
	the chirping of morning birds Wesker is SLAPPED startlingly
	on the back... by Barry.
	
	Pg-20
	
				BARRY
			Look here, man.  I'd follow you
			into any kind of enemy fire.  But
			these things ain't firin' at us.
			They want us for breakfast!  When
			are you gonna tell us what the
			hell is goin' on here?
	
				WESKER
			When you need to know.  Just do
			your job, soldier.  That's what
			I'm doin'.  My job.
	
	Wesker pulls a chain from under his shirt. It holds a card,
	the size of a Visa, like the one Jill found in her secret
	envelope, only Wesker's isn't blue, it's green.
	
	Stepping away from Barry, he slide the card through a slot
	in the iron gate-frame.  BUZZZZ.  The GATES SWING OPEN with
	a rusty SQUEAL.
	
	INT   TUNNEL   MORNING
	
	CHRIS crawls through a long, dark shaft with earthen walls,
	a man-made tunnel.
	
	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MANSION   MORNING
	
	AT THE MANSION'S FRONT DOOR, a hand-carved monolith of solid
	oak, WESKER finds another hidden SLOT and swipes his card.
	The giant door CREAKS OPEN.
	
	INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING
	
	INSIDE, the place looks like a HAUNTED HOUSE, a glorious
	ruin, once spectacular, now mysterious and threatening.
	The chandeliers and furniture are covered with sheets that
	ripple on breezes from a thousand faults in the old walls.
	Indistinct NOISES echo within the ceiling, the floor, as
	ALPHA TEAM enters.
	
				AIKEN
			Old. They probably don't have cable.
	
				SULLIVAN
			They probably don't have radio.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Who's they? Who's place is this?
	
	WESKER shuts the front door. The BOOMING SOUND makes us
	wonder if we will ever see it opened again.
	
	
	Pg-21
	
				WESKER
			Guy named Arkley.  Bootlegger.  Built
			this old fortress during prohibition.
			He figured nobody'd ever find him out
			here in the back woods.  Nobody did.
			Till he died.  Feds have had it ever
			since.  Place has been here for eighty
			years... derelict... a safe-house.
	
				BARRY
			A safe-house... for who? For what?
	
				WESKER
			There's a... a secret installation.
			Below.  A network of laboratories.
	
				REBECCA
			What kind of... laboratories?
	
				WESKER
			(Shrugging) They didn't issue us
			gas-masks, so I figure... it's okay
			to breathe.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Why send in a strike-force?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Yeah. What are we supposed to do?
			Polish the silver?
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			There's a man downstairs. A top-
			priority man.  It's our job to...
			bring him out.  Hopefully, there
			are others alive, as well. We'll
			Rescue them, too... if we can...but
			Dr. John Marcus... he comes out alive
			at any and all cost.
	
	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   MORNING
	
	Though it's still morning, the windows are sealed over.  No
	sunshine can enter. From this point on... there will be no
	indication of time... except as shown on clocks.  A sense of
	dread takes hold of us as...
	
	...dark SHADOWS LURCH...FEET SCRAPE sluggishly... not in
	combat boots, but in Nikes, loafers, Dr. Martens... past an
	accordion GATE of corroded bronze.  A motor HUMS.  Behind
	the gate, an old-fashioned service ELEVATOR rises... but stops
	just below floor level. EYES peer out, waiting for the
	shuffling feet to pass.  Then the car rises the rest of
	the way, revealing its occupant...
	
	Pg-22
	
	...JILL VALENTINE! She's alive! She deactivates the
	elevator by pulling her blue ACCESS CARD out of an incon-
	gruously modern receptacle. Checking to be sure that the
	coast is clear, she slides the accordion gate aside and
	steps out into the corridor.
	
	With a ghostly MOAN, something LUNGES at her out of the
	shadows. It's A MAN in a lab coat. His skin is ROTTING,
	his teeth SNAPPING, like the dogs'. He tries to BITE Jill,
	not merely to do injury. He seems HUNGRY!
	
	Jill leaps aside, lifting her pistol and FIRING... once,
	twice, three times. The man is shot in the stomach, heart,
	neck...but he keeps coming! Finally, Jill shoots him in the
	head...and he falls.
	
	Jill quickly reloads, on instinct. But as she does it, she
	stares at the corpse, frowning, weighing life-long belief
	against the hideous facts of the moment.
	
	INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING
	
	WESKER and his troopers hear the GUNSHOTS. There are THREE
	DOORS nearby. Wesker selects one that seems to lead to the
	source of the gunshots. Using his card, he unlocks it.
	
				WESKER
			Three men stay here. Chambers...
	
				REBECCA
			I'm not a man.
	
				WESKER
			Rodriguez...
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			I'm better than a man.
	
	Wesker grins, but hardly skips a beat.
	
				WESKER
			Alright. you come with us. Aiken,
			Sullivan, stick here with Chambers.
	
	The troop moves out. Aiken and Sullivan remain in the
	central hall with Rebecca.
	
				AIKEN
			Why us?
	
				SULLIVAN
			I dunno why me. You? I guess the
			C.O. figures you're as worthless
			as a dame, Aiken.
	
	Pg-23
	
	Sullivan catches Rebecca's eye.
	
				SULLIVAN (cont.)
			Er... sorry, ma' am. I... I didn't  ...
			I meant Aiken... Not you.
	
				REBECCA
			Relax. I get it.
	
	INT   MANSION LIBRARY   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER leads his TROOP into an enormous, cobwebbed library
	lined with book shelves, but no books. There are doorways
	on all four walls. Wesker pulls out something that looks
	like a Game-Boy. He types on a keypad. A MAP of the mansion
	appears. Wesker scrolls with the arrow-keys. Barry looks
	on very impressed with the high-tech unit.
	
				BARRY
			That thing...tells you where to go?
	
	Wesker doesn't answer. He pockets the "Game Boy".
	
				WESKER
			One man stays here. Ridley. You're
			it. Shoot to kill. Just make sure
			it's not one of us. The rest of you...
			this way.
	
	Wesker, leads his squad through one of the doorways. RIDLEY,
	a young rookie, remains.
	
	INT   UNDERGROUND CAVERN   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS reaches the end of the earthen tunnel. There are
	signs that children once played here... TOY SOLDIERS.
	GRAFFITI.  Chris finds his nickname... Christopher Reddy...
	etched in hardened mud.  After a moment of reflection,
	he moves on, into...
	
	
	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS
	
	...a small, sheet-rock chamber.  CHRIS rushes to a DOOR
	that looks like it's been there since the beginning of time.
	As soon as he touches the knob... AN ALARM SOUNDS!
	
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	RIDLEY, standing guard, hears THE ALARM. He hears Chris
	JIGGLING the knob. But he sees NO DOOR. The walls around
	him seem to be solid slabs.
	
	
	Pg-24
	
	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS can't get the doorknob to turn. Behind him, a dusty
	ORIENTAL CARPET BULGES upward. One corner flops aside.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	RIDLEY is spooked by the sound. Frightened, trembling,
	he un-slings his rifle.
	
				RIDLEY
			Who... who's there?
	
	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS doesn't hear the trooper. Behind him, A Decomposed
	HAND pokes out of a drainage ditch beneath the carpet. It
	gropes. Finds purchase on the floor.
	
	Chris is unaware of the danger. He HURLS himself against
	the door. He can't break through.
	
	The thing that climbs out of the ditch was once a man, once
	a SCIENTIST. It's wearing a lab coat and a pair of thick
	EYEGLASSES. But it's long dead. It's... A ZOMBIE.
	
	As it pulls itself up, its eyeglasses strike the side of the
	ditch. They fall, CLATTERING, the rims scraping the zombie's
	cheek, which peels away like onion skin.
	
	Chris hears the noise. Turns and sees...
	
	...the dead man, reaching out hungrily.  Chris is trapped.
	He aims his Winchester. CLICK! He forgot. It's empty.
	
	The zombie pulls itself fully up onto the floor. Chris digs
	in his shoulder bag. Pulls out a handful of bullets and with
	them, accidentally, Jill's BERET. Rising emotion stops him
	for a moment.
	
	The dead man crawls toward him. Chris might not have time
	to load. As he tries to jam a bullet into his rifle, the
	zombie SWATS at him.  Catches the beret.  Looks at it.
	Sniffs it.  The bullet pops out of Chris' nervous fingers.
	He tries to load another.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	RIDLEY spots A BLUE ACCESS SLOT in the wall. He levels his
	automatic and CHEWS the thing up with a short burst.
	
	A PANEL SWINGS OPEN! CHRIS dives out... with the ZOMBIE
	inches behind him. Ridley FIRES off another BURST OF ROUNDS.
	
	
	Pg-25
	
	Stray bullets PIERCE the zombie's head. It drops back into
	the chamber...with Ridley never knowing why.
	
	Ridley and Chris look at each other, asking rapid-fire
	questions, none of them answered.
	
				RIDLEY
			Who are you?
	
				CHRIS
			Who are YOU? What the hell is 
			S.T.A.R.S.?
	
				RIDLEY
			How'd you get in here?
	
				CHRIS
			Who sealed the door?
	
				RIDLEY
			Who knew there a door?
	
	WHAM! ANOTHER ZOMBIE appears suddenly behind Ridley, BITING
	out the muscle between his shoulder and neck. The trooper
	stands, stunned, for a moment...
	
				RIDLEY
			Who... who... ?
	
	...then he drops..
	
	The zombie, in a uniform, once a security guard, gazes dully
	at Chris.  A wet sound comes from inside its gullet as it
	calmly chews on Ridley's flesh.  Swallowing, it reaches out.
	Chris grabs its arms, FLINGS it into the chamber. Then
	FIRES his Winchester, once, putting a HOLE in the thing's
	head. Chris slams the door.
	
	
	INT   MANSION   DINING ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	In a Hearst-sized dining room with draped furniture, WESKER
	and the OTHER TROOPERS have heard the new gunfire.
	
				SPEYER
			Where'd that come from?
	
				BARRY
			Back...where we just were.
	
				SPEYER
			Shit, man, we're chasin' our tails!
	
	
	
	Pg-26
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS hears the CLATTERING of the troopers heading his way.
	What he doesn't hear is... a slight CRACKLING... in the walls.
	
	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER and his TEAM burst into the corridor with the old-
	fashioned ELEVATOR.  FLASHLIGHTS find... the body of the
	ZOMBIE that was shot by Jill, bullet HOLES allover its body.
	
				SPEYER
			Damn. Surnbitch took a lotta lead.
	
				BARRY
			That's not what killed him. Blood's
			still running. Wounds are fresh.
			But look at his skin. This guy's
			been dead for a couple of days.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			He was dead... before he was shot?
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS checks Ridley.  No pulse.  His own rustling movements
	prevent him from hearing... that soft CRACKLING SOUND.
	
	The kitchen is lined with fifty-year-old IVY-PATTERNED
	WALLPAPER.  The printed VINES seem to be MOVING!  Chris
	doesn't notice until the vines begin to WIGGLE furiously...
	and RIP THROUGH the paper.  They're REAL.  Sprouts from
	some sort of exotic plant, that have climbed up the walls...
	with INTELLIGENCE!  They seem aware of Chris' presence.
	
				REBECCA (O.S.)
			Ridley?
	
	REBECCA has appeared in an open doorway. Chris looks at her,
	with the tips of the vines beginning to brush his shoulders.
	
				REBECCA (cont.)
			Who... who are...
	
				CHRIS
			I... I'm one of the good guys, okay
			I'm just trying to...
	
				REBECCA
			(Calling) SULLIVAN! AIKEN!
	
				CHRIS
			Shit.
	
	
	Pg-27
	
	Chris, familiar with the room, opens a SMALL DOOR in the
	wall, barely man-sized, and almost invisible because it's
	covered in matching wallpaper. Chris dives in.
	
	AIKEN and SULLIVAN pop up behind Rebecca, having barely
	caught a glimpse of Chris.
	
				AIKEN
			Who was that?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Forget him. What are they?
	
	Sullivan points at the vines... which are swirling, groping,
	as if alive, making their way toward Ridley's body.
	
	INT  MANSION   CHUTE   TIMELESS
	
	In a LAUNDRY CHUTE, propping himself against the sides,
	CHRIS descends...down...down... as he did as a child...
	and comes out onto...
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   TIMELESS
	
	...a DROP-CEILING, newly installed. Iron frames support
	AIR-FILTRATION SYSTEMS and other heavy MACHINERY. Sheet-
	metal walls have replaced the old soffit and fascia. LIGHT,
	from somewhere below, knifes through gridded iron vents.
	
				CHRIS
			Somebody did some major remodeling.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	The VINES continue to advance.
	
				REBECCA
			We gotta get him out!
	
	THE TROOPERS rush to retrieve RIDLEY'S BODY. The VINES hover
	around them, occasionally DARTING, then pulling back, as if
	they were timid animals, hungry, but afraid of anew food-
	dish. When AIKEN brandishing his M-16, the VINES RECOIL and
	RETRACT fully... THWIP THWIP THWIP... behind the wallpaper and
	down... somewhere into the bowels of the house.
	
				AIKEN
			What? Smart fuckin' plants?
	
				SULLIVAN
			No big deal. Most-plants are
			smarter than you, Aiken.
	
	
	Pg-28
	
	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	THE OTHERS are still puzzling over the DOWNED ZOMBIE.
	
				SPEYER
			Why would anyone shoot a dead man?
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Lemme guess. Maybe 'cause he was...
			walkin' around?
	
	Barry steps closer to the corpse, notes its collapsed skull.
	
				BARRY
			Head-shot. We were sprayin' those
			dogs outside... but think about it.
			Were any of 'em brought down without
			a head-shot.
	
	Wesker has been exploring the corridor. Stopping in front
	of the elevator, he shines his light into the car. We expect
	someone... or some-thing... to be lurking inside.
	
	An attack comes from the opposite direction. A FIGURE BURSTS-
	out of the shadows behind Weasker. Another Zombie?  No.  It's
	JILL! In a rage, she holds her pistol to Wesker's head.
	
				JILL
			I lost three me.  You killed them,
			Wesker. You did... and I did. Because
			I didn't know what to expect... because
			you... didn't tell me!
	
				WESKER
			(Calmly) Tell you what?
	
				JILL
			Anything! I wasn't told anything!
	
				WESKER
			Put down the gun.
	
	Instead, Jill CLICKS the hammer back.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Put down the gun.
	
				JILL
			Not until...
	
				WESKER
			RELEASE! THAT'S AN ORDER, SOLDIER!
	
	Jill blinks. Slowly, reluctantly, she lowers her gun.
	
	Pg-29
	
	Wesker turns... and recognizes her.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			How... did you get in here?
	
				JILL
			(Sarcastic) How ya doin' , Valentine?
			Good to see ya. Glad you're still
			alive. Same here, colonel, I'm...
	
				WESKER
			How did you get in here?
	
				JILL
			(Exploding) The same way those fuckin'
			dogs got out! Through their pens!
			(Relaxing some) I... locked them off.
	
				WESKER
			Good thinking.
	
	A VOICE interrupts, from the end of the corridor.
	
				VOICE (o.s.)
			MAN DOWN!
	
	The voice is SULLIVAN'S. The troopers run to join him.
	Last to leave the corridor are Wesker and Jill. Wesker
	gestures gallantly.
	
				WESKER
			Ladies first.
	
				JILL
			Fuck you.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	The TROOPERS trickle into the kitchen to find... REBECCA,
	kneeling over RIDLEY'S CORPSE, examining the ragged bite
	on its neck.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Maybe... they're in the house.
			More of them dogs.
	
				REBECCA
			Diameter's too small. It... almost
			looks as if... it was done by a...
	
				JILL
			(Arriving) A human?
	
	Rebecca looks up. The two women make sisterly eye-contact.
	
	
	Pg-30
				REBECCA
			Yes, but... what kind of... human...
			would do something like this?
	
				AIKEN
			Not a vegetarian, that's for sure.
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken, you'd be better off...
	
				REBECCA
			There was a guy. Not part of the
			team. And there was... some kind
			of... plant... that seemed... alive.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Gimme a fuckin' break.
	
				AIKEN
			No shit. It disappeared... right
			into the wall.
	
	Rodriguez cringes when she finds a ragged hole in the wall-
	paper near where she's standing.
	
				WESKER
			I guess it's... time to spill it.
	
	WESKER pulls off his dark glasses for the first time.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			I don't know... much more than I
			already told you.  I'll tell you
			the rest now.  The labs hare are...
			were...working on special apps for
			bio-eng1neered materials.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Speak English, hombre.
	
				WESKER
			Marcus has been experimenting with
			an artificial... man-made... virus.
			Coded...the 'T'-virus.  Financing
			came from a private corporation, you
			may have heard the name... Umbrella.
	
				JILL
			They're... multi-national. Huge.
	
				WESKER
			So huge that they have... connections...
			in high places.  That's why we're here.
	
	
	Pg-31
	
				BARRY
			This virus... it jumped, right?
	
				SPEYER
			Shit! We're all dead! We got the
			bug, and we're all dead!
	
				WESKER
			It's not airborne. It was spread...
			in the water supply. Lab animals
			and... the researchers themselves...
			passed it on... by...
	
				JILL
			By... biting.
	
	Wesker hangs his head. It's an affirmation.
	
				BARRY
			You catch this virus and... what?
	
				WESKER
			You die. But... not for long. The
			chemical...revives the brain, and...
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			You stand back up... and chew on
			the first guy you see.
	
				SPEYER
			Christ, this is like... Night of the
			Living Dead!
	
				BARRY
			Why, in the name of Jesus, would
			anybody wanna mess with shit...
			that does that shit?
	
				WESKER
			Victory, friend. Civilization has
			come a long way, but we still have...
			war.  Imagine... a soldier who can't
			die.  That... was the concept.
	
				JILL
			But the virus... jumped.
	
				WESKER
			Hopefully... if we got all the dogs...
			we've contained it.
	
				JILL
			Hopefully?  Jesus... why didn't you
			tell us?
	
	
	Pg-32
	
				WESKER
			By telling you NOW, I've put your
			lives in jeopardy. Nobody has this
			information. Except a few high-and-
			mightys. Me. And now, you.
	
	The troopers fall silent as all this sinks in.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			We have to get Marcus out of here.
			He developed this thing. He's the
			only one who... understands it.
	
				REBECCA
			I don't know, this all sounds pretty
			shaky to me...
	
	With a lightning move, Wesker draws his pistol and...BLAM!
	FIRES... at Rebecca. She flinches. The bullet flies past
	her and SHATTERS the skull of RIDLEY, the dead trooper who,
	having stood up, was about to attack Rebecca from behind.
	Ridley drops... dead again.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Guess that proves it. A head-shot
			knocks 'em down.
	
	Rebecca turns and looks at the blood-splattered body.
	
				REBECCA
			Th-that man.. .was dead. (Freaking)
			I... I'm a doctor! I should know!
			That man was dead!
	
	Vickers reaches in Rebecca's bag, pulls out an ammonia
	capsule, cracks it, and holds it under her nose.
	
				VICKERS
			I hope you have a lot of these.
	
	
	INT   CRAWL-SPACE   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS crawls across the drop-ceiling, into the up-rising
	light from one of the vents. He looks down through the
	grid work and sees...
	
	...the same LABORATORY that was behind Marcus in the opening
	video. No longer pristine, it's wrecked, torn apart. Files
	are scattered everywhere along with smashed fragments of
	furniture and computer hardware.
	
	CAGES that line the walls are filled with LAB ANIMALS making
	NERVOUS CHATTER. Chris watches a MONKEY sip water from a
	dish. Like the other animals, its skin is rotting.
	
	
	Pg-33
	
	Chris is about to move on, when his eye catches...
	
	...MOVEMENT... outside the cages.  There's A MAN, in a
	lab coat, sitting at a desk, writing on a note pad.
	
				CHRIS
			(Calling) Hey.
	
	CLOSE ON: the man's HAND... flaking, decomposing.  The pen
	it holds is making only random, erratic marks.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			HEY!
	
	The man turns his head, slowly, to look up toward the voice.
	There's NOTHING left of his FACE. RAW TISSUE seeps odd-
	colored fluids. A single eyeball is nested tenuously in
	the ooze. Something like a mouth, recognizable only because
	of its position, opens... and GROANS.
	
	Chris, pumping his Winchester, hears... KRANG! A NOISE from
	below. He looks down again, just as...
	
	...the lab door BURSTS open. WESKER and ALPHA TEAM stream
	into the lab. The thing with. the destroyed face turns toward
	the invaders, stands, and shuffles toward them.
	
	Without hesitation, Wesker, on point, FIRES a quick burst
	into the thing's brain. It drops like a sack. The lab
	animals SHRIEK.
	
	The team files in, not noticing... ANOTHER ZOMBIE... crawling
	across the floor...heading directly for SPEYER. Chris shouts
	
				CHRIS (cont. )
			HEADS UP!
	
	He punches out the grate with the barrels of his rifle
	and... BLAM!...punches a sure-fire HOLE in the zombie's head.
	
	BRAD VICKERS, his nerves badly frayed, thinks the team is
	being attacked. He SPRAYS the ceiling with his automatic.
	
	Chris ducks and rolls, narrowly escaping the initial barrage,
	but bullets keep coming, punching a dotted line up through
	the ceiling panels.
	
	Chris scrambles, as fast as he can, his feet barely escaping
	the punch holes.
	
	He finds himself on top of an enormous checkerboard of vents
	and Plexiglas panels. Bullets weaken the framework. It
	sags... then CRACKS, dropping away. Chris is plunged into...
	
	
	
	Pg-34
	
	INT   LAB   LEVEL "A" TIMELESS
	
	...WATER! CHRIS kicks, paddles with his rifle, righting
	himself, getting his bearings. He's in a huge AQUARIUM
	that's built into one of the laboratory's walls... and he's
	not alone. There are SIX SHARKS in the tank. ZOMBIE SHARKS,
	their flesh rotting, leaking pus.
	
	The largest of them SNAPS at Chris, but its jaws catch only
	a clump of his swirling hair. Chris kicks with his feet,
	remaining upright, and FIRES his wet Winchester.
	
	The bullet wimps-out, restrained by the water. It penetrates
	the shark, but barely. We can see the casing lodged in the
	animal's flesh.
	
	Chris gets an idea. He kicks forward. Plants the barrel
	of his Winchester directly against the aquarium glass...
	only to find himself aiming directly at...
	
	...JILL, who is aiming back at him with her M-16. They're
	both stunned. They stare at each other for a moment, like
	gunfighters, until...
	
	...another shark circles in for an attack. Chris swings the
	Winchester away from Jill and FIRES underwater. The aquarium
	glass CRACKS... but holds.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			Hang on! We're gonna get wet!
	
	Jill FIRES. More CRACKS, but the glass is resistant.
	Chris out. Water SURGES into the lab, knocking Wesker and
	some of his squad down.
	
	They stand up again, only to find themselves knee-high in a
	dark pool...with SHARK FINS slicing the surface. Everybody
	opens fire. The dead fish keep coming.
	
				AIKEN
			Where the fuck is a shark's brain?
	
				SULLIVAN
			In it's head! I swear, Aiken, you
			would be better off dead.
	
	In a bizarre frenzy, the sharks KICK their tails, making
	startlingly quick turns, darting every which way, SNAPPING
	at the scent of warm flesh. The troopers, hampered by the
	water, SPLASH around wildly, many of them nearly getting
	bitten. The air above thickens with a fog of graphite from
	ten spitting automatics.
	
	
	Pg-35
	
	The water gets darker as it becomes clouded with BLOOD. But
	thankfully, the level is dropping. The water is seeping out
	through GRATES in the floor. The sharks become more visible,
	moving slower as their bellies scrape the floor.
	
	The troopers pick them off, one by one. The immediate threat
	passes...but as the water drains away, the troopers become
	aware of... a KLAXON-LIKE SOUND. ANOTHER ALARM. The entry
	door glides shut with a BOOOMMM!
	
				WESKER
			Nice. Very NICE, Valentine! You
			set off a containment breach!
	
				JILL
			It must have been the water. God,
			the water! (She turns to Chris}
			Did you swallow any?
	
				SPEYER
			I did.
	
				SULLIVAN
			A bunch of us did, man.
	
				WESKER
			Separate systems. Salt water.
			No germs. But.. .it breached!
	
	Wesker, looking crazed, his sunglasses gone, is typing on
	his "Game-Boy"... getting no response.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			We can go in deeper.  But we can't
			get out.  Not with my card-key.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			So...we live here now.
	
	Rosie finds Sullivan looking at her curiously.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.}
			Landlords. Shit hills. Kicked my
			family out of six apartments. I
			got use to sayin'...'So...we live
			here now'.
	
				WESKER
			There are override exits... but I
			can't find them without THIS!
	
	Wesker FLINGS his "Game-Boy" angrily against a wall. It
	shatters into bits.
	
	
	Pg-36
	
				CHRIS
			That was a smart move.
	
	Wesker bristles. He's about to confront Chris, but he spots
	his sunglasses where they were deposited on a floor grate by
	the water. He walks over and picks them up, wiping the
	lenses on his shirt. Without looking at Chris, he asks...
	
				WESKER
			And... you are?
	
				CHRIS
			Nobody.  Just a...a local guy...
	
	Chris spots a dry lab-coat hanging on a wall hook. He takes
	it down and uses it to dry his rifle.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			...who gets pissed-off when he finds...
			his farm animals... and his father's
			oldest friend... dead. And the only
			woman he ever cared about turns out
			to be a goddam METAL HEAD!
	
	Wesker, while seeming to understand, still doesn't look up.
	
				WESKER
			Valentine...who is this asshole?
	
				JILL
			His name is Chris Redfield. He was...
			part of my cover, sir.
	
				CHRIS
			Cover?
	
	A snappy argument develops, a lover's quarrel, with higher-
	than-normal stakes.
	
				JILL
			This is not the time to mouth off,
			Chris! You're in deep shit here!
	
				CHRIS
			Why didn't you let me in on this?
	
				JILL
			Why did you have to come after me?
			How did you get in here, anyway?
	
				CHRIS
			I used to play here, when this was
			a fucking laundry room!  And what
			makes you think I came after YOU?
	
	
	Pg-37
	
				BARRY
			(Interrupting) Whoa! Look here.
	
	Barry is stooped over the faceless zombie that Wesker shot.
	He rips an I.D. badge from the corpse's coat.  He tosses it
	to Wesker, who reads the I.D... "DR. J. MARCUS"
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			Is this the pile of shit we're
			supposed to bring out of here?
	
				WESKER
			It...it once was.
	
				VICKERS (o.s.)
			I got something here.
	
	BRAD has been quietly working at one of the lab's computers.
	Barry rushes over and looks at the monitor screen.
	
				BARRY
			A map. Same as on your gizmo. Exits
			marked...blue and green.
	
	Wesker steps in for a look.
	
				WESKER
			The greens are the overrides. (To
			Brad) Can you print this out?
	
				VICKERS
			I can try.
	
	Chris calmly retrieves his wet shoulder bag from the floor.
	He wrings out the cloth and, using the lab coat, wipes the
	bullets dry.
	
				VICKERS (cont.)
			(Off the screen) We're on level 'A'.
	
				WESKER
			We have to get down to level 'D'.
	
				BARRY
			Hold on. Marcus is dead. If this
			mission was about bringin' him out,
			we're outta here, right?
	
				WESKER
			I wish we were, but no. We have
			a potential outbreak here. We might
			be the only ones who can stop it.
	
	Pg-38
	
				SPEYER
			Stop it? How?
	
				WESKER
			There's... an antidote.
	
	Everyone's ears perk.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			We can't bring Marcus out, but we
			can bring out the serum. Maybe
			somebody...can analyze it... and
			figure how to beat the virus.
	
	Jill looks at Chris. Catches him weighing options.
	
				JILL
			(Privately) Not simple.
	
				CHRIS
			(Privately) Not complicated, either.
			We only have to decide... what's right...
			and what's wrong.
	
				JILL
			(Privately) I forgot. You're never
			confused. So...what's right, Mohawk?
			And what's wrong?
	
				VICKERS
			Shit. (At the computer) There are
			no green exits on this level. Why...
			why would that be?
	
				CHRIS
			They don't want anybody up here
			to go snoopin' ...upstairs or down.
	
	Wesker looks at Chris with that odd, confident smile.
	
				WESKER
			Pretty good guess. You must have
			been in the military, son.
	
				CHRIS
			Native American. Exempted.
	
				VICKERS
			(Typing, starting to panic) Fuck!
			There... there's no way out!
	
				CHRIS
			Yes there is.
	
	Chris points at the broken grid above the shattered aquarium.
	
	
	Pg-39
	
	Wesker looks up. Then looks back at Chris.
	
				WESKER
			Not a bad idea. (Turning to
			Vickers) See if you can call
			up... service charts, schematics.
	
	Brad's fingers fly. He scrolls through menus.
	
				VICKERS
			Got it. Ceiling grids, ladders.
			The whole infrastructure.
	
				WESKER
			Print it. Print all of it.
	
	The young man types a command. Wesker rushes over to the
	H. P. and grabs the first chart that rolls out.
	
	Rebecca steps over to Brad. She points at his leg.  Seated
	at the computer, his trousers hiked, BLOOD can be seen on his
	sock, just above his boot.
	
				REBECCA
			What's that from?
	
				VICKERS
			(Nervous) I...snagged it. On the
			desk. When we were scrambling.
	
				REBECCA
			Lemme look at it.
				VICKERS
			(Adamant) No. It's just a scratch!
	
	Chris watches Wesker as he studies the printed charts.
	
				CHRIS
			There's a... part of an old laundry
			chute. It might not show on there.
			It runs up to the kitchen.
	
				WESKER
			I'm not going up. I'm going down.
	
	Wesker, grim-faced, looks at his team.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			I'd like to let you guys off the
			hook. But I can't. I need back
			up. You're comin' with me. Any
			objections?
	
	The troopers exchange glances. Jill is first to speak.
	
	Pg-40
	
				JILL
			No objections. We'll back you up.
	
				CHRIS
			(Disappointed) You said... people
			wind you up and you do whatever
			they want you to do.
	
				WESKER
			Stay out of this, son. You're the
			only one who doesn't have a choice
			in this. There's no place to lock
			you up. I can't let you go, you're
			a security risk. I could shoot you.
			Legally. But your lady-friend would
			probably get all over my ass. So...
			I'm afraid you're comin' with us...
			whether you like it or not. (To Jill,
			pointedly) He's your responsibility,
			Valentine. See that he doesn't make
			trouble.
	
	Jill looks at Chris.
	
				CHRIS
			You up to the challenge?
	
				JILL
			Try me.
	
				CHRIS
			(Snappy) I already have.
	
	INT   CRAWL-SPACE   TIMELESS
	
	One by one, the members of ALPHA TEAM wiggle up into the
	crawl space above the ceiling. CHRIS climbs up behind JILL.
	OTHER TROOPERS are already away, following WESKER, who guides
	them with the help of his chart. Jill starts after them.
	Chris grabs her arm.
	
				CHRIS
			Jill, I... I'm sorry. I'm just...
			angry. When I... thought you were
			gone, I... Then... when I saw you.
			Alive. I realized that...
	
				JILL
			That you were still... fascinated.
	
				CHRIS
			Stop. Stop!
	
	He pulls her into an embrace. She goes willingly.
	
	
	
	Pg-41
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Come with me. We can get out of here.
	
				JILL
			(Tempted) I...I want to. I want...
			nothing more. But... I can't. When
			I'm in this uniform, I'm more than...
			just me. Try to understand...there's
			no "I" in Team, Chris.
	
				CHRIS
			There's no "I" in DEAD, either.
	
	Chris pulls away from the embrace and looks at her.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			I should order you to come with me.
			You'd never refuse an order.
	
				JILL
			You go. You're not part of this.
			
			
				CHRIS
			I'm part of it as. long as you are.
	
				BARRY (o.s.)
				This is very uncomfortable.
	
	Barry, having overheard, is halfway up through the grate.
	
				CHRIS
			For me, too, brother.
	
				BARRY
			I mean this... (indicating the
			iron that's pressing his belly.)
			It's very uncomfortable.
	
	Chris and Jill help Barry up into the crawl space.
	start off after the troop. THE CAMERA TRACKS them.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			This is gettin' old, Man, I swear.
			I been in this Army eighteen years.
	
				CHRIS
			Eighteen years?
	
				BARRY
			Yep. Two away from the big re-ti.
	
				JILL
			Desk job, right? Nobody lasts that
			long if they've seen action.
	
	
	
	Pg-42
	
				BARRY
			I've seen action in Granada.  And
			Desert Storm.  Would have lost it
			all there... if my buddy didn't bring
			in a team, against orders, to pull
			my ass out.  Buddy named... Wesker.
	
				CHRIS
			You've been with this asshole since... ?
	
				BARRY
			Since before that.  We were... kids
			together.  Macon, Georgia.  He's...
			only an asshole some of the time...
	
	UP AHEAD : WESKER reaches a service ladder. He waves his
	troop on. They start to climb down.
	
				VICKERS
			Who knows what we'll find down there?
	
				AIKEN
			Think positive.  The farther down we
			go, the worse it's gonna get.  So...
			until we hit bottom, we're in good
			shape... relatively speaking.
	
	GRRRAAAAWWWLr.! Distant... but distinct... it sounds like
	the MGM lion.
	
				SPEYER
			What the fuck?
	
	Again .GRRRRRAAAAAWWWWLLLL !
	
				VICKERS
			Whatever it is.. .it can't get us.
			We're in the ceiling!
	
				AIKEN
			Maybe it's like... really tall.
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken...
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	The lead TROOPERS reach another section of the ceiling.
	Clustering around a vent, they look down into...
	
	...the "B"-level lab, more streamlined, more high-tech than
	the one upstairs. There are large COMPUTERS, linked by
	metal-shielded conduits to jacks in the walls.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-43
	
				WESKER
			Main-frame. Might have some data
			we could use. (A quick decision)
			Fox, Marini, Vickers.  Down.
	
	WESKER kicks out the vent. He jumps first, through the
	opening, down into the lab. CHRIS watches from behind.
	
				CHRIS
			The man has balls, I'll say that.
	
	Wesker grabs a desk and pushes it under the vent.  MARINI
	climbs down, followed by FOX.  BRAD is last.
	
				WESKER
			Hustle it, Vickers.  You're the guy
			we need.  To cut into the network.
	
	INT   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER looks around. There are THREE Doorways...open wide
	with only darkness beyond. Wesker runs around closing them.
	
				WESKER
			Watch these entrances, guys.
	
	FOX and MARINI take up posts. Brad lowers himself gingerly.
	He drops the last two feet onto the desk, landing on his
	bloody leg.
	
				VICKERS
			AAAAH ! Shit.
	
	He topples, falling to the floor, but pops up instantly.
	
				VICKERS (cont. )
			I'm alright. I'm alright.
	
	He limps over and attacks the computer keys.
	
	GRRRRRAAAAAWWWWWLLLL! Another distant snarl.
	
				WESKER
			Hold tight. It doesn't sound like
			it's on this level.
	
				VICKERS
			(At the computer) Shit. I'm locked
			out. Any clues for a password?
	
				WESKER
			Try... Umbrella.
	
	Brad types rapidly, nervously. Flubs. Types again.
	
	
	Pg-44
	
				VICKERS
			Nothing. Wait. I'm into... No.
			No data. Just some kind of video
			feed. Time-coded. Yesterday.
			It's a play-back. (Watching the
			screen) Holy shit!
	
	We HEAR it before we see it. The sound of absolute PANIC.
	People SHOUTING! SCREAMING! THUDS and CRASHES! GLASS
	BREAKING! Then A WOMAN'S VOICE .
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
			Please...please.. .if anyone is
			receiving this...
	
	Brad limps around the desk and spins the monitor for the
	others to see. The WOMAN is an ORIENTAL. She's standing
	in the foreground, as Marcus was in the opening video.
	Behind her is a lab we haven't seen yet... with white-
	coated FIGURES... RUNNING... FIRING GUNS.
	
				WOMAN (cont.)
			the situation is completely.
			out of control. We...
	W
	HAM ! The woman is pushed out of the way by A MAN who is
	trying to protect her from...
	
	...SOMETHING that BLURS past the lens, like a pendulum,
	from ABOVE.
	
	In the next instant... SPLAT... the lens is COATED WITH BLOOD!
	As it oozes down, we see a partial image of the same MAN.
	His HEAD is OUT OF FRAME at the top of the screen.
	
	The thing above must have a hold on it... because the man is
	DANGLING, his arms witching. His back has three GOUGES in
	it, long and so deep that they might have been made by
	piece of heavy machinery. We only see this for an instant...
	before the man is LIFTED, straight UP, with amazing SPEED.
	
	Wesker clicks off the monitor. The other men instinctively
	look up above their heads.
	
				FOX
			Maybe the ceiling's not such a
			safe place, after all.
	
	CRASH! The door behind Fox BURSTS open. Before he has
	time to react A ZOMBIE is on him, BITING his cheek, neck,
	shoulder. The two figures fall to the floor, grappling.
	Wesker can't get a clean shot.
	
				WESKER
			Scram! SCRAM!
	
	
	Pg-45
	
	Marini is first to reach the desk, but he helps the limping
	Brad up ahead of him. TWO MORE ZOMBIES lurch in through the
	open doorway. Wesker shoots them, but he sees MORE... can't
	tell how many...shambling toward the open doorway from the
	darkness beyond.
	
	Wesker focuses on Fox, who is still being MAULED, BITTEN.
	Fox SCREAMS. Wesker still has no safe shot.
	
	Brad is YANKED up into ceiling by SULLIVAN and AIKEN. CHRIS
	leans out of the opening, reaching for Marini.
	
	Wesker KICKS the mauling zombie in the head. It takes three
	hard BOOTS to attract the thing's attention. When it finally
	looks up at him, Wesker BLOWS out its skull.
	
	Fox is lying on his stomach, writhing, BLEEDING profusely
	from a half-dozen bites. Wesker stoops down, trying to roll
	him over, lift him up. Fox resists. He's gone insane.
	
	Chris pulls Marini up to safety. BARRY leans down through
	the opening.
	
				BARRY
			Haul ass, boss!
	
	The zombies are heading for Wesker. There are three of them.
	Barry shoots at the one in front. Misses. His second shot
	hits the thing's brain.
	
	Wesker again tries to hoist Fox who, this time rolls over on
	his own. He has drawn his pistol. Before Wesker can stop
	him, he eats the barrel and BLOWS out the back of his head.
	
	One zombie is dangerously close. Barry fires two more
	rounds. No head shot, but the zombie staggers and, though
	not dead, FALLS...directly toward Wesker. The colonel rolls
	on his back, kicking himself away, managing to get clear.
	He uses his own pistol to BLAST the zombie.
	
	He scrambles to his feet, darts toward the desk, and jumps
	up. The third zombie grabs his legs. From above, Barry
	risks a dangerous shot. BLAM! Wesker hears the bullet
	WHIZZZ past his head like a mosquito.
	
	The zombie is hit in the skull. It drops. There are MORE
	of them coming out of the darkness. Barry takes hold of
	Wesker and, with a single strong arm, pulls him up into...
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	...the crawl space, where WESKER breathes heavily for a
	moment... then looks up at his old friend.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-46
	
				WESKER
			That's...two I owe ya.
	
				BARRY
			One. We were all... 'Even-Steven' .
	
				WESKER
			Two. Remember? 'Even-Steven' ...
			is not in my vocabulary.
	
	A horrible MOANING SOUND comes from below, in the lab.
	THREE MORE ZOMBIES can be seen clustering around the desk,
	dumbly trying to climb up, sensing the "food" above.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Let's move.
	
	Wesker takes off. SPEYER, RODRIGUEZ, AIKEN and SULLIVAN are
	quick to follow. The others lag behind when CHRIS says...
	
				CHRIS
			Those things could get up here.
			We can't let that happen. This
			is our way out...
	
	Chris swings his legs through the grate and JUMPS down...
	
	INT   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	...ONTO THE DESK. He BOOTS one of the ZOMBIES away and
	tries to LEAP over the others. One of them catches his foot
	in mid air. CHRIS isn't hurt, but he TOPPLES to the floor,
	sprawling, losing his Winchester.
	
	The zombies have him cornered. He crawls toward his rifle.
	Reaches it. Pumps a shell into the firing chamber. Aims
	at the closest of the walking dead...
	
	...which was once a young man, a simple laborer, wearing
	overalls, with a name tag...
	
				CHRIS
			(Reading) Caruso.
	
	Chris looks empathetically into the thing's dead eyes.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Can you hear me?
	
	The zombie lumbers forward hungrily.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Caruso! Can you hear me?
	
	Pg-47
	
	Chris has come late to the realization that these things
	were once human. Now he comes late to the realization...
	that they are human no longer.
	
	The zombie grabs the barrel of the Winchester, pushing it
	aside. Chris can't bring it back to bear on the monster's
	head. He BLASTS a round through the thing's belly. It has
	no effect. The zombie reaches for Chris' throat. Starts to
	lean in to bite him.
	
	BLAM! The thing's skull explodes. JILL has jumped down
	onto the desk. She FIRES another accurate pistol round.
	The SECOND ZOMBIE falls.
	
	Jill leaps to the floor and starts to push the desk. Chris
	gets to his feet, rushing in to help her. Together, they
	shove the desk out from under the open ceiling grate.
	
				CHRIS
			Thank you.
	
				JILL
			Any time. How do we get back UP?
	
				CHRIS
			Shit, if you didn't have a plan, you
			shouldn't have jumped down here.
	
				JILL
			We have a real problem here, Chris.
	
	Jill nods toward the open doorway. There are more stuttering
	FIGURES approaching out of the dark.
	
				CHRIS
			How big is this place? How many
			people were down here? How...
	
				JILL
			HOW DO WE GET UP?
	
	With a startling SOUND, A DARK SHAPE swing down from above
	and GRABS Jill! Is it the thing we saw on the video?
	
	No. It's BARRY! His mighty arms lift Jill. She's caught
	by Aiken and Sullivan and pulled up to safety. Barry grabs
	Chris and lifts him as well.
	
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS grabs the edge of the grate and pulls himself up.
	He reaches back down through the opening. Below, BARRY
	squats... and makes a mighty leap-with his muscular legs.
	Chris grabs his arms... and is nearly pulled back down.
	
	
	
	Pg-48
	
				CHRIS
			(Straining) Big. Heavy.
	
	Jill grabs on, then Sullivan. But one of the ZOMBIES has
	reached Barry. It GRABS his kicking legs. It's TEETH SNAP!
	And CATCH! The commandos lift Barry clear, but the zombie
	ends up with a CHUNK of something in its mouth.
	
				JILL
			It got you!
	
	Barry checks his leg. His trousers are torn, but...
	
				BARRY
			No skin broken. I'm alright.
	
				CHRIS
			We owe you a pair of pants.
	
	They crawl away. The zombies below reach up, their fingers
	clutching, at the ceiling, but with the desk gone, there's
	no way they can get up.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT   STORAGE AREA   TIMELESS
	
	THE COMMANDOS climb down a steel access ladder into a storage
	room stacked with CRATES and CARTONS. There's only one door.
	The place seems secure.
	
	
				WESKER
			Stand down. Five minutes.
	
	WESKER sits on a crate and pulls out his printed charts.
	Gradually the whole troop makes it down into the room.
	They relax. A few light cigarettes. But not SPEYER.
	
				SPEYER
			I'm through, Wesker.
	
				MARINI
			Me too, man. This ain't nothin'
			I signed on for.
	
				WESKER
			(Calm) You want to wait here, fine.
	
				MARINI
			Wait here? No. We're gettin' out!
				
				WESKER
			You can't. (He flashes his access
			card.) Not without this.
	
	
	Pg-49
	
				SPEYER
			Fuck you! And your fancy doors and
			your green key! The choppers have
			rockets. They can blow out a wall
			if they have to. I'm callin' 'em in.
	
	Speyer pulls out his radio and starts to punch a code.
	
				WESKER
			You wanna see a wall blow, I'll
			blow all of 'em for ya.
	
	Wesker reaches down to the electronic unit that he lost and
	retrieved in the woods. He pulls a long wire out of it, with
	a small sensor on the end.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			I'll put a crater in this forest that
			takes out Racoon City and everything
			else for twenty miles... with this.
	
	He jams the little sensor into his ear and pushes a button
	on the belt unit. Small red LIGHTS blink.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			It's a radio detonator...to set off
			explosives that are...buried under
			neath us somewhere. The ultimate
			containment measure. Incinerate the
			place. (Smiling again) It has a...
			dead-man mechanism... .(he taps the
			ear-piece) ...that reads my pulse.
			My heart stops, and... boom.
	
				CHRIS
			You...lunatic! That damn thing can
			slip out of your ear by accident!
	
				WESKER
			That's right. It's your job...all
			of your jobs...to see that it doesn't.
			And to see that my heart... doesn't
			skip any beats.
	
	Wesker looks over the tops of his sunglasses... at Speyer
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Give me the radio, soldier.
	
	Speyer hesitates. Wesker explodes, for the first time.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			GIMME THE FUCKIN' RADIO, OR WE

	Shocked silence. Sullivan is the first to speak.
	
				SULLIVAN
			Sumbitch might do it, Speyer.
	
				WESKER
			I'II be obliged to do it! If I don't
			get that antidote, I'll have to burn
			this place out! (Beat) Valentine.
			The radio.
	
	Jill steps over to Speyer and takes the radio from him.
	
				CHRIS
			(To Jill) What are you, this guy's
			flunky? He just threatened to blow
			us all up, for Christ's sake!
	
				JILL
			That's what I'm trying to prevent!
	
	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   IN THE AIR   DAY
	
	WHAP WHAP WHAP... one HUEY is in the air..., THE CAMERA MOVES IN
	on a window. LAGUARDIA is flying, his RADIO MAN beside him.
	
				LAGUARDIA
			How many digits did you receive?
	
				RADIO MAN
			Six. The beginning of an air-
			support code, but... it just went
			dead on me.
	
				LAGUARDIA
			Call S.T.A.R.S. in Washington.
			I want...
	
				RADIO MAN
			Hold it...
	
	The radio man presses his headset to his ear. LaGuardia
	looks on apprehensively.
	
				RADIO MAN (cont.)
			It's Wesker. (Into mike) Yes, sir.
			We got the signal sir. (He clicks
			off) He says it was... a mistake.
	
				LAGUARDIA
			Call Washington anyway. I want
			the authority to take action if
			necessary.
	
	
	
	Pg-51
	
	
	INT   OFFICE   TIMELESS
	
	BRRRING! The hand with the ostentatious RING snatches a red
	telephone receiver from of a desk drawer.
	
				MAN WITH RING (o.s.)
			Holden.
	
	He listens. Once again, we don't see his face. Just his
	free hand, with another Monte Cristo burning.
	
				HOLDEN (Man with ring, cont.)
			Denied. This is Wesker's show.
			If he was in real trouble, we'd
			have lost half of Pennsylvania
			by now.
	
	As the hand flicks ash, we see a sheet of paper on the desk
	with a letterhead that bears... an UMBRELLA LOGO.
	
				HOLDEN (cont.)
			No authorization.
	
	
	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   IN THE AIR   DAY
	
	In the HUEY, the RADIO MAN clicks off an incoming call.
	
				RADIO MAN
			No independent action.
	
				LAGUARDIA
			Damn. I feel so fuckin'... helpless!
	
	The huey over flies THE MANSION which, from the air, looks as
	stable as the Rock of Gibraltar.
	
	
	INT   STORAGE AREA   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER has come down off his rampage. He looks exhausted.
	He also looks staunchly heroic as he speaks to his TROOP.
	
				WESKER
			You guys were hand-picked. A Special
			Unit. Most of you have been sitting
			on your asses, drawing pay checks for
			more than two years. Well... it's time
			to repay those... Government loans.
	
				SPEYER
			Bull shit. I'm not...
	
	Wesker lifts his automatic. Speyer flinches. The action
	wasn't meant as a threat. Wesker is just checking his ammo.
	
	
	
	Pg-52
	
				WESKER
			Pitch your empties. Put all your
			loaded clips on that crate there.
			I want a count. Then I want the
			rounds divvied up... evenly.
	
	The troopers deposit their loaded clips, reloading the ones
	that are half-used.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Alright. We're on.. .(checking the
			maps) ...level "C"...
	
				AIKEN
			Lingerie. Notions.
	
				WESKER
			GOD DAMMIT, NO MORE JOKES! We have
			men dead upstairs! This hell-hole
			is full of people who died... because
			of this stinkin' ...BUG!
	
	Jill has been counting the ammo clips.
	
				JILL
			Forty two.
	
				SPEYER
			That's all we have?
	
				WESKER
			We weren't expecting a war, Speyer.
			(To Jill) I'll take three. Three
			to your boyfriend...
	
				CHRIS
			Don't need 'em. Got my own loads.
	
	Wesker's eyes dart angrily toward Chris. But he notices
	Jill watching him...and he calms himself.
	
				WESKER
			Good. Then... we all get four clips.
	
				SPEYER
			They must have... weapons down here,
			somewhere. A powder magazine.
	
				WESKER
			No more side trips. It was a mistake
			to go into that lab upstairs. My
			mistake. And I'm not makin' another
			one. From now on it's straight ahead.
			In and out.
	
	Pg-53
	
	Wesker stands and opens the door.  Outside is a SERVICE
	CORRIDOR with unfinished walls. Spaces between raw metal
	beams are stuffed with insulation. Wesker checks the jamb
	outside. It's got a lock mechanism. Blue.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Not an override. My key won't work
			here on the way out. Prop the door.
	
	The troopers drag a heavy crate over to hold the door open.
	Wesker moves out. The commandos trickle after him. Chris
	holds Jill behind for a moment.
	
				CHRIS
			Jill...this guy is a Loony-Toon.
	
				JILL
			He's just... trying to get the job
			done. Doing what he has to do.
	
				CHRIS
			Yeah, well...I hope you'll say
			the same about me... when I do...
			what I have to do.
	
	Chris turns and walks off. Jill follows him out into...
	
	
	INT   SERVICE CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	...the corridor. They catch up with the TROOP which is
	clustered at a blind alley which has two doors.
	
				WESKER
			(Checking his map) It's not clear...
			which way to go.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Want me to flip a coin?
	
	WESKER is annoyed by the remark. Decisively, he selects one
	of the doors and uses his green key card. With a BZZZZ, the
	lock releases. The troop enters...
	
	INT   SYSTEMS CENTER   TIMELESS
	
	...a vast ROOM, fifty-by-fifty yards. It's filled with
	HEATERS, AIR CONDITIONERS, WATER PUMPS. MAIN FRAMES for
	the internal computer network line one wall, FUSE BOXES
	and SWITCHER PANELS another. This is the systems center
	for the entire facility.
	
	There's an attendant's desk just inside the door. AIKEN
	and SULLIVAN drag it over to prop the door open. It makes
	
	
	
	Pg-54
	
	a frightening SOUND as it scrapes the floor, echoing,
	bouncing around in the large space. It prompts a response...
	another of those animal-like SNARLS from somewhere in the
	distance.
	
				SULLIVAN
			What's that sound like to you?
	
				AlKEN
			A meat-eater.
	
	There are thick columns, floor to ceiling, every ten feet.
	The spaces between them are very dark. It's hard to see.
	WESKER and some of the OTHERS click on their FLASHLIGHTS .
	Beams cut through dust.
	
	There are ELECTRONIC HUMS.. CLICKS and CHATTERS emit from
	the switchers, PINGS from the heaters, all combining to fray
	everyone's nerves. Light beams dance nervously as the
	commandos start out across the dark and frightening space.
	
				CHRIS
			(Softly to Jill) This is the heart
			of the whole place. They've got to
			have it... protected somehow.
	
	Two things happen, almost at once. First.. .CHRIS notices
	ELECTRIC EYES... on all of the columns.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			DUCK! HIT THE DECK!
	
	Second. A ZOMBIE lurches around a corner and BITES a chunk
	out of MARINI'S face. JILL whirls around to shoot at the
	zombie, but Chris grabs her and FLATTENS her on the floor.
	
	Marini, staggering, screaming in pain, triggers the first
	electric eye. LASER BEAMS shoot in all directions, forming
	a tight NET. Chris and Jill are barely beneath them.
	Many of the other troopers are hit by the beams... which do
	no immediate harm... but wherever they make contact, small
	CYLINDERS above the electric eyes begin to HISS.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			FOR CHRISSAKE, GET DOWN!
	
	The commandos duck under the laser beams... just in time.
	Jets of STEAM spout from the cylinders. It's not just hot
	steam. It's ACIDIC, deadly.
	
	Marini is hit by it. His clothes IGNITE. His flesh BOILS.
	It's a horrible sight, but for the moment, the jets stop.
	
	
	
	Pg-55
	
	Marini is dead on his feet. When he falls, he trips another
	of the laser beams. The steam jets SPOUT again. The troop
	is beneath them, though many are burned by liquid drops that
	spit from the nozzles.
	Amazingly, the zombie has avoided contact. But as it begins
	to stumble after commandos, we realize it's going to activate
	the sensors again.
	
				SULLIVAN
			There's no way outta this mousetrap!
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			So we live here now?
	
				SPEYER
			We gotta run for it.
	
	The zombie hits one of the laser beams. The steam HISSES
	out again. The zombie is MELTED.
	
				AIKEN
			Bad idea, Speyer.
	
				CHRIS
			Down. Through these.
	
	Chris has noticed a series of hinged panels in the floor.
	
				VICKERS
			Where do they go?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Does it matter?
	
	Sullivan whips out a Swiss Army knife and goes to work on
	the screws that hold down one of the panels. Other troopers
	do the same.
	
	Another ZOMBIE lurches out of the darkness. And ANOTHER.
	
	Human hands work furiously, loosening screws. Panels come
	up, Troopers begin to duck through the openings.
	
	A second zombie hits a red beam. STEAM again. Chris and
	Jill are spattered. Burned. But Jill bravely keeps working
	with her own issued knife. She gets a panel open. As she
	drops through, a third zombie triggers a burst of steam.
	Chris ducks and covers.
	
	When the jets stop, Chris begins to climb into the opening,
	but one of his legs is GRABBED from behind by...
	
	...one of the dead things which has already been MELTED!
	
	
	
	
	Pg-56
	
	Its flesh is bubbling. Bone is beginning to show. But
	the acid hasn't reached its brain yet. The creature is
	still alive.
	
	Chris CRIES out. Acid from the zombie's hands is burning
	his leg. The thing's lips have been eaten away, making its
	teeth look frighteningly skeletal as it leans forward for a
	bite of flesh. Chris jams the stock of his Winchester into
	the zombie's mouth. He's able to hold the thing's head back,
	but he's stuck. He can't let go.
	
	Jill pops up out of the floor. She presses the barrel of her
	own weapon into the zombie's forehead.
	
				JILL
			On three...
	
				CHRIS
			One... two...
	
	Chris pulls his rifle away. At the same instant, Jill FIRES.
	The zombie is PROPELLED through the air. One of its flailing
	arms triggers another laser beam. Chris throws himself in on
	top of Jill as STEAM HISSES over them.
	
	Twenty yards away, Wesker crawls under the cloud of acid.
	Just as he climbs down through one of the openings, he feels
	pressure...on his ear.
	
	A groping zombie has accidentally hooked its fingers onto the
	wire that runs from the detonator to Wesker's ear-piece.
	For a breathless moment, it seems like the sensor will be
	popped loose. Holding the pulse-reader in place, Wesker
	twists his body, lifts his hand gun, and PUMPS THREE into
	the dead thing's brain.
	
	The zombie flops over, but its fingers cling, entangled, in
	the wire. Wesker plants his pistol barrel on the knuckles
	of the thing's dead hand. THREE MORE SHOTS cut through bone,
	removing the fingers from the hand. The wire is freed.
	Wesker dives into the opening in the floor.
	
	
	INT   AIR DUCT   TIMELESS
	
	The COMMANDOS find themselves in an AIR DUCT. No room to
	stand. Hardly room to sit.
	
	Chris looks at his rifle stock. It's corroded from the acid
	in the zombie's mouth. Jill notices.
	
				JILL
			God...and it doesn't even stop them...
	
	
	
	Pg-57
	
				CHRIS
			It's not meant to stop them. It's
			meant to stop...something else.
	
	That distant SNARLING SOUND comes again, making Jill shiver.
	The troop is strung out along the metal shaft. REBECCA
	crawls among them, treating the worst burns. WESKER checks
	his maps. SPEYER confronts him again.
	
				SPEYER
			We damn near got turned into Rice
			Krispies by that gizmo of yours.
			If you don't want me to nail that
			fuckin' thing into your ear, you
			deactivate it. Right now.
	
				WESKER
			I can't. They.. .fixed it... so you
			can't chicken out. The system can
			only be turned off at the main panel.
	
				BARRY
			Where the hell is that?
	
				WESKER
			Where the explosives are. Down...
			farther than we need to go. We only
			have to make it down one more level.
			If... when... we make it back up to
			the choppers... we can fly out of
			the detonator's signal range.
	
	Chris calls out from the far end of the shaft
	 
				CHRIS
			I'm not willing to rely on that.
			I live here, this is my town!
	
				WESKER
			The town's been evacuated. Just...
			just in case.
	
				CHRIS
			That explains the lie. About the
			plane crash. An airplane down...
			with weapons on board... would nicely
			explain a big explosion, wouldn't it?
			You figured all along you might have
			to blow this place!
	
				WESKER
			I don't want to do it. I... I hope
			I don't have to.
	
	
	Pg-58
	
	Chris looks down the dim air-shaft, unable to see Wesker's
	eyes, hidden by distance.. .and by his dark glasses.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			That's the best I can do for you,
			kid. Good faith. Now... let's
			knock on it.
	
	Wesker moves out. The troop follows.
	
				CHRIS
			I...I can't let this happen. I've
			got to find that bomb.
	
				JILL
			I'll help. Once Wesker gets what
			he wants, my obligation is over.
	
	Chris looks at her with appreciative eyes .
	
				CHRIS
			No. I want you out. With the
			rest of them. Wesker won't push
			the button until you're clear.
	
				JILL
			He doesn't want to push the button.
	
				CHRIS
			He has to. Don't you see? He can't
			leave these labs here. And, Jesus...
			walking corpses! He's gotta get rid
			of the evidence.
	
	INT   AIR SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	The light is dim at its best. Long stretches of the shaft
	are pitch black, and there's a constant stream of air that
	MOANS eerily. This whole mission has been like a descent
	into Hell, darker and more frightening with each level down.
	
	There are turn-offs, "T"s and "Y"s. At one point, when JILL
	looks back, she finds ROSIE behind her. Chris is gone. Did
	he leave to deal with the bomb?
	
	No, but he's about to. He's at the rear of the pack, pressed
	against the side-wall, waving others past.
	
				JILL
			Chris, no!
	
				CHRIS
			I've got to try and stop this.
	
	
	
	Pg-59
	
	Jill starts back toward Chris, but freezes.. .everyone freezes
	when... the duct-work starts to PING.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Shit. One thing after another.
	
	BOOM! The air shaft is ROCKED, as if punched by a giant
	fist. Then...the whole structure begins to SHIMMY. What
	is it, an earthquake?
	
				WESKER
			Sit tight. Ride it out.
	
	GRONK! A sheet-metal panel BUCKLES! Others do the same.
	All along the shaft, panels begin to FOLD INWARD. Something
	outside is CRUSHING the duct as if it were a giant tube of
	toothpaste. And the troopers are being SQUEEZED inside.
	
	RIVETS POP! The panels begin to SEPARATE...and large,
	pulsing bits of FLESH appear! Not animal flesh. But the
	flesh of A PLANT! The things that press in through the
	openings are larger versions of the vines we saw in the
	kitchen. Those were its fingertips. These are its ARMS.
	Strong arms that are RIPPING the ductwork apart.
	
	Chris, Rebecca, Aiken and Sullivan end up in one part of the
	shaft. The rest in another... including Jill, who calls out.
	
				JILL
			CHRIS!
	
	The section that holds Chris' group FALLS AWAY... with a
	monstrous, CRUNCHING sound.
	
	INT   ARBORETUM   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS' GROUP spills out of the dangling metal, with cables
	from the torn ceiling...TZZZZZT...SPARKING around them.
	The troopers drop out of Hell, into...PARADISE.
	
	An enormous HOT HOUSE, a lush, indoor JUNGLE of PLANTS,
	IVIES, GRASSES. It's like a RAIN FOREST, complete with
	a thick, damp MIST that makes it difficult to see. We might
	be on another planet. None of the foliage seems indigenous
	to Earth. There are LEAVES the size of bed sheets, FLOWERS ,
	the size of armchairs. And at the center of it all, is the
	mother of the deadly vines...
	
	...PLANT 42, a monstrous schefflera, twenty times normal
	size. Most of its limbs reach upward, where they have opened
	CRACKS in the ceiling and walls, to stretch on into the
	facility above. There are also dozens of shorter, beefier
	"arms", each of which act independently, like tentacles on
	an octopus... and each has a large, drooling POD at its tip.
	
	
	Pg-60
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	BURSTS OF GUNFIRE from three M-16s shatter our ears... and
	a ceiling VENT. WESKER and THE OTHERS jump down into...
	
	...a very unusual CORRIDOR. It seems to stretch forever, in
	both directions. It has no doors, no visible means of exit
	or entry. The walls are made-up of multi-colored polymer
	TILES, whose irregular shapes fit together like a JIGSAW
	PUZZLE. The floor is HEAVY STEEL, though faceted. It seem
	designed to shift. The whole corridor looks like it might be
	able to bend, to change position, like an airport jet way.
	
	There are disconcerting signs of damage...claw-like GOUGES on
	the tiles, clean cut HOLES punched through the metal ceiling,
	larger in diameter than any that might have been caused by
	bullets.
	
	And there are smears of BLOOD everywhere, as if some terrible
	battle... or battles...took place here.
	
				WESKER
			This way. (He starts off.)
	
				JILL
			No. That way.  Chris and the others...
	
				WESKER
			If they're dead, they're dead. If
			they're alive, they'll still be alive
			in twenty minutes. When we get back.
	
				JILL
			Maybe not. And how do we know it's
			only going to be twenty minutes?
			How do we know we'll be able to come
			back this way?
	
				WESKER
			We don't. But we'll do our damndest
			to try. This is it, guys. The home
			stretch. Let's go.
	
	Wesker trots off. Vickers and Rodriguez follow. Speyer and
	Barry hang back... with Jill, who remains torn.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			(Looking back) Valentine. You're
			on the clock! Fall in!
	
	Jill wrestles with her emotions but, in the end, dutifully,
	she "falls in".
	
	As the troopers move off, we hear odd SCRATCHING SOUNDS...
	with the high-pitched SQUEAL of metal-on-metal.
	
	
	Pg-61
	
	
	INT   ARBORETUM  TIMELESS
	
	The beefy "ARMS" of PLANT 42 undulate overhead as CHRIS and
	his COMPANIONS look for an exit.
	
				REBECCA
			Th-this thing was no accident.
			It was cultivated!
	
				CHRIS
			And it didn't rip out the ceiling
			for the fun of it. Stay alert.
	
	The plant seems to behave intelligently, with caution. The
	pods on its "arms" dart, almost as if sniffing... then pull
	back...like the vines in the kitchen, like timid animals.
	
	Chris spots A DOORWAY.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Here.
	
	As the others follow him, one of the pods swoops down in
	front of REBECCA, and doesn't withdraw. It hovers there.
	Its follicle's open like jaws, which display serrated daggers
	of cartilage that look like teeth. Inside, a pulsing calyx
	emits a pistil that twitches and swells.
	
				AIKEN
			My mother made me eat vegetables.
			I know 'em all. This ain't one
			of 'em.
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken...
	
	
	ANOTHER POD swoops down on Sullivan's back. Its BEAK clamps
	onto the flesh between his shoulder blades. It's PISTIL
	shoots out like a hypodermic needle, stabs him and, within
	the blink of an eye, SUCKS out every ounce of the man's
	blood. His skin turns the color of PARCHMENT, FLAKING OFF
	HIM like powder, as he dies.
	
				AIKEN
			Sullivan! JESUS, SULLIVAN!
	
	Aiken rushes to his buddy's side.
	
				CHRIS
			Get out of the away!
	
	Chris launches himself off a stone retaining wall around one
	of the gardens. Leaping up, he grabs one of the SPARKING
	CONDUITS and pulls it down.
	
	
	Pg-62
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Get OUTA THERE, AIKEN!
	
	Chris ends up having to shoulder Aiken out of the way.
	Tendrils from the plant very nearly get both of them, but
	Chris manages to JAM the semi-rigid conduit into a pool of
	sprinkler-fed WATER around the plant's roots.
	
	A BRIGHT CURRENT stutters through every vine. The plant
	SHRIEKS, hideously, as electricity causes fluids to SQUIRT
	from boils that develop on its flesh, down along its "arms",
	and into its blood-sucking pods...which FLOP, lifeless, to
	the floor, with the same sort of liquid SMACKS that human
	skulls might make.
	
				AIKEN
			They.. .they killed Sullivan. The
			bastards... whoever did this shit...
			they KILLED SULLIVAN!
	
	Enraged, Aiken draws a long-bladed KNIFE and wildly attacks
	the remains of Plant 42, slashing at the thing's dead limbs,
	not stopping until he cuts into...
	
	...something that looks like a vine...but BLEEDS RED!
	Aiken traces the thing with his eyes, up to where it's
	coiled in high tree branches. It's the oversized body...
	...of A COPPERHEAD, with a belly SIX FEET in diameter.
	As Aiken gasps, spellbound, he's STUCK from behind.
	
	The snake is so long, its body is draped on one side of the
	greenhouse, but its head is on the other. With the power
	of a dozer-shovel..JAWS like the open hood of a Cadillac...
	TEETH the size of windows...CLAMP onto Aiken's mid-section,
	instantly CRUSHING his ribs.
	
	Chris finds a skein of ROPE. He throws the long end over a
	ceiling beam, then instantly makes a LASSO out of the piece
	in _is hand and tosses the loop at the snake's head .
	
	Aiken's body, in the serpent's jaws, makes the rope miss.
	Chris throws again. In the seconds between tosses, the snake
	has SLURPED Aiken into its mouth. The rope encircles the
	beast's head. Chris pulls. The noose slips down over the
	snake's maxillaries and tightens around its neck. Chris uses
	all his strength. With the ceiling beam as a pulley, the
	snake's head is SLAMMED against the rafters.
	
				CHRIS
			(To Rebecca) Hold this.
	
	Rebecca is, understandably, not quick to respond.
	
	
	
	Pg-63
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			GET IN HERE, SOLDIER!
	
	In this crisis, Chris finds himself sounding a lot like
	Wesker. It sobers him. It sobers Rebecca, as well. She
	rushes in and takes hold of the rope.
	
	Moving fast, Chris rushes to where Aiken's knife dropped
	on the floor. He grabs it, turns back, and sees...
	
	...something MOVING inside the snake's beaded torso. It's
	Aiken... still alive.
	
	Chris charges, PLUNGES the knife into the beast, hacking
	through layers of fat until he reaches a bloody CAVITY.
	
	Aiken is curled within, like Jonah in the Whale. His chest
	has been crushed to half its normal size. Acids from the
	monster's intestine have begun to eat through flesh on his hands,
	his face, but he's still conscious, able to wheeze-out words.
	
				AIKEN
			K-kill me. S-Sullvan said...I'd
			be.. .better off dead. That...ain't
			never been truer than now. Kill me!
	
	The snake uses all its strength to lower its head from the
	ceiling. Rebecca hangs bravely onto the rope, but she's
	LIFTED, bodily, off the floor.
	
	The rope SNAPS, cut by the steel beam. Rebecca falls. The
	trailing edge of the noose catches on twisted debris. It
	delays the snake for two seconds.
	
	Those fragile seconds give Chris just enough time to reach
	into the open belly of the monster...and pull the PINS on
	TWO GRENADES that dangle from Aiken's vest.
	
	The giant copperhead SNAPS at Chris from behind, missing him
	by inches. He dives, like a wide-receiver reaching for a
	pass. What he catches is...
	
	...Rebecca's arm. His momentum carries her down to the
	floor. They roll behind another STONE WALL that contains
	tons of earth, which protects them from...
	
	...BOO-BOOOOOM!... the explosions of the grenades... which blow
	Aiken... and yards of the snake's mid-section...into eternity.
	
	
	INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	The same nervous HANDS that we saw in the opening fidget on
	the polished surface of the conference table. A distorted
	VOICE scratches over a speaker-phone.
	
	
	
	Pg-64
				VOICE ON THE PHONE (o.s. filter)
			We're close. I think I'll be able
			to get the package. It's been...
			very interesting.
	
				VOICE IN THE ROOM
			Anything you can't handle?
	
				VOICE ON THE PHONE (o.s. filter)
			(Chuckling) There's nothing I
			can't handle.
	
	A hand with an ostentatious RING flicks cigar ash.
	
				HOLDEN
			Keep us appraised.
	
	Holden's hand clicks off the speaker-phone.
	
				HOLDEN (cont.)
			(To the others in the room) I'm
			reassured, gentlemen...that every-
			thing is...under control.
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER, alone in the strange, faceted corridor, packs away
	his radio. He hears... FOOTSTEPS. JILL appears.
	
				WESKER
			Where are the others?
	
				JILL
			Right behind me. Were you...
			talking to someone?
	
				WESKER
			To Washington. To my... superiors.
			They're your superiors too, Valentine.
			Don't forget that.
	
	Jill wonders. Should she challenge Wesker? She has no time
	to think. More FOOTSTEPS come CLACKING at her back. It's
	RODRIGUEZ and SPEYER. A moment later, BARRY and VICKERS
	appear from the opposite direction.
	
				BARRY
			Nothin'. man. No doors. Nothin'.
			We hit a dead end.
	
				SPEYER
			Us too. Cement wall.
	
				VICKERS
			We're never gonna get to that lab.
	
	
	Pg-65
	
	TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG... a sound like a rivet gun resounds
	in the corridor, repetitive, but random, not rhythmic.
	
	
	INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS and REBECCA are crawling through a two-foot high
	feeder-passage for electric cables, their bellies scraping
	the floor, their backs the ceiling. They hear the sound...
	
	...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG! Then suddenly...it stops.
	
				REBECCA
			(Crying quietly) I... can't take
			this any more.
	
				CHRIS
			We take what comes. That's the
			secret of our genius.
	
	He looks back. Rebecca sniffles.
	
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			How old are you?
	
				REBECCA
			Not very old at all. Not nearly
			old enough to...to...
	
				CHRIS
			None of us is old enough for that.
	
	Rebecca nods, forcing a smile meant to be appreciative.
	
				REBECCA
			Jill... told me... you were nice .
	
				CHRIS
			She did? She never told me.
	
	That sound returns... TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...getting louder.
	
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	Down in the corridor, the other TROOPERS see...
	...faintly in the dusty reaches of the dark... AGILE SHAPES
	advancing... not along the floor, but along the CEILING!
	They look like apes, swinging from... What could they be
	swinging from? The ceiling is solid metal.
	
	CLOSE ON: A MONSTROUS HAND, both hairy, and scaly. It's
	fingers have ten-inch claws.. .more like horns... which PUNCH
	upward, penetrating the ceiling metal, and clamping on.
	
	
	
	Pg-66
	
	THE SHOT WIDENS to reveal A BEAST, unlike any we've seen,
	dangling from the ceiling. It is ape-like... and lizard-
	like. With ferocious eyes that glare from beneath an insect-
	like carapace. This thing is an amalgam of all the nasty
	creatures that have pursued us in our nightmares. It's
	called... A HUNTER.
	
	There are SIX OF THEM... as far as we can see, there might be
	more coming from behind. Their three-toed feet also have
	claws that can pierce the ceiling, enabling them to move
	forward... hand over foot, foot over hand.
	
	One of them lets out a GRRROWLLLL! The same sound we've
	been hearing through the walls. Now it echos in the
	corridor, up close and personal. The troopers open fire,
	even before the creatures get in range.
	
	
	INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS and REBECCA hear the gunfire.
	
				CHRIS
			Hurry.
	
	Chris crawls on. Rebecca is stopped when... TCHUNNNNGGG !
	One of the HUNTERS' CLAWS PUNCHES up through the floor ,
	almost stabbing her. Rebecca SCREAMS. In the tight space,
	Chris is barely able to reach back and take her hand.
	
	TCHUNNNNGG! TGG! More CLAWS penetrate the metal.
	The couple plunge ahead of them, the way Chris plunged
	ahead of the bullets on Level "A".
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER, JILL and the OTHERS spit lead at the advancing
	creatures. Bullets THUNK into their bodies. Blood flows,
	but the creatures seem to feel no pain. Even when they're
	hit squarely in their skulls.
	
				BARRY
			Head shots. Ain't doin' nothin'!
	
				WESKER
			That was the idea.
	
				BARRY
			What idea?
	
				WESKER
			To win. The idea was... to win.
	
	
	Pg-67
	
	Jill aims at one of the hunters, pressing the trigger of
	her M-16, and not letting go until her clip runs out.
	The creature's head is turned RAGGED by the barrage...
	revealing an iron SUPERSTRUCTURE beneath the skin.
	
				VOICE (o.s.)
			Now that... is a metal-head.
	
	Jill looks up. CHRIS jumps out of the open grate in the
	ceiling. REBECCA jumps down after him.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			What d'ya think? Should I wait
			for orders, or just wing it?
	
				JILL
			Wing it!
	
				CHRIS
			You know...that just might be
			the ticket. Wing the fuckers.
	
	Chris takes a careful SHOT with-his Winchester. He hits one
	of the Hunters squarely on its WRIST...which SNAPS. The
	creature drops to the floor.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Forget the head shots. They're
			useless. Shoot for the joints.
			The JOINTS!
	
	Rebecca opens FIRE with Aiken's M-16, giving the others time
	to reload. Barry is the first to resume firing...at the
	closest of the Hunters... at its wrists, which are SNAPPED
	by the bullets. The creature drops to the floor.
	
	The troopers fire at KNEES, ANKLES, ELBOWS, which seem to
	be the weakest spots. More of the hunters drop from the
	ceiling...but they continue to advance, crawling, pushing
	themselves forward with whatever limbs remain intact.
	
				SPEYER
			Run! We slowed 'em down. Run!
	
				BARRY
			Where? As far as we'll get, either
			way, is a cement wall.
	
	There are two hunters left on the ceiling. One of them makes
	a mighty, impossible LUNGE... and hits Speyer like a battering
	ram, slashing his CHEST OPEN with its claws.
	
	Two of the hunters on the floor rush forward, not attacking,
	but wanting to feed on Speyer's remains.
	
	
	Pg-68
	
	Brad, trembling, completely crazed, drops his weapon and
	backs away. He sees...one of those jigsaw tiles, a RED
	one, GLOW from within. He thinks he's hallucinating until...
	
	...the floor JERKS, in a tight spasm. Its steel facets
	begin to separate, sliding away from each other. The
	troopers narrowly escape as.. .
	
	...the floor behind them GRINDS, in and out, left and right,
	as if it were CHEWING. Speyer's body, and those of the
	hunters on the floor, are EATEN by the powerful steel blades.
	But one hunter remains above it all. TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG,
	it continues to advance along the ceiling.
	
	An invisible, JIGSAWED DOOR glides open twenty yards down
	the hall. The troopers run for it, and are met by a
	beautiful Asian scientist... the woman we saw on the video
	playback... ADA WONG.
	
				ADA
			You lost a man. If I had only
			been faster. I was unfamiliar
			with the mechanism.
	
	TCHUNG TCHUNG... the Hunter approaches .
	
				ADA (cont.)
			God. One of them... is still ..
			Quickly. Inside. Quickly!
	
	The troopers rush into...
	
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
	...a security cubicle. CHRIS is the last to enter, barely
	making it before the door begins to slide shut.
	KA-TCHUNK! CLAWS penetrate the opening.
	
				ADA
			Don't worry, it's mindless. It
			doesn't realize that it's strong
			enough to push the door open.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			Sometimes the dumb get lucky.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Hasn't happened to me, yet.
	
	The Hunter GROWLS. Its snout darkens the space between door
	and wall. Mucous from its nostrils spits through.
	
	
	
	Pg-69
	After a terrifying moment, the claw recedes. The dark
	snout disappears. The snorting fades away. Followed by
	a distant...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...as the hunter departs.
	Everyone relaxes, visibly.
	
	The troopers turn and, for the first time, notice two haggard
	SCIENTISTS standing across the room.
	
				ADA
			My... colleagues. Benjamin. Toshiro.
			As far as we know, we are the...only
			ones.. .left alive. We worked on "C"
			level. One of the biologists saved us.
			Brought us down here. He knew that...
			he didn't have long to live. He...
			started the mechanism... out there,
			in the corridor.. .and he let it...
			take him.
	
	Ada stares at a complicated control panel.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			I only saw it used that one time.
			Or perhaps...I could have been
			faster. The man...you lost...
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			You did fine, lady. We're obliged.
	
				ADA
			As are we. (Sighing) We believed...
			we would die here. Believed...the
			bomb would destroy us.
	 
				 JILL
			You knew.. .about the bomb?
	
				ADA
			The end for a place like this, when
			it fails... must be a bomb, yes?
	
	Jill looks at Chris. His point has been proven.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			But now... that you are here... the
			bomb will not come.
	
				CHRIS
			It... already came. ma'am. We
			brought it. The colonel, here...
			he's wearing it.
	
	Ada looks at the detonator on Wesker's belt, at the sequence
	of blinking lights.
	
	
	70
	
				ADA
			(To Wesker) Is it true? Are you
			here to... rescue? Or destroy?
	
				WESKER
			Both. (With that odd smile of his)
			If I have to pick only one... I'll
			pick destroy.
	
				ADA
			You're not S.T.A.R.S. You're Umbrella.
	
				WESKER
			Once again. Both. (Still smiling)
			Two salaries. Three if you count
			combat pay.
	
	Ada looks at him with disgust.
	
				ADA
			The man I loved, John Marcus...
			developed the organism that caused
			all this. He... he did it for
			humanitarian purposes. It was
			taken away from him...for in-human
			purposes...by men like you!
	
				WESKER
			No, ma'am. Men like me... are just
			errand boys. Sent in to do the
			wet-work. All of the glory. None
			of the benefits.
	
				ADA
			After what you've seen down here,
			do you think any of it could be
			turned into... benefit?
	
				WESKER
			Yes. I think it could be turned
			into five or ten million dollars.
			How do we get into "D" lab?
	
				ADA
			Death lab. (She slumps) John
			was killed...never even knowing it
			existed. They kept him... isolated,
			upstairs, while a separate team was
			down here...corrupting his research.
			Using it to build B.O.W.s.
	
				CHRIS
			B.O.W.s?
	
	
	Pg-71
	
				ADA
			Bio-organic weapons.
	
				REBECCA
			The sharks. The plant.
	
				ADA
			Early experiments.
	
				CHRIS
			The snake.
	
				ADA
			A failure. Its behavior remained
			reptilian. All they could ever get
			it to do was... grow in size.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Those dogs. They were weapons.
	
				ADA
			No. They... simply became infected.
			As did... everyone else. Janitors.
			The cook. Electricians. Guards.
			People who believed they were serving
			their flag. Scientists. Great minds...
			turned into mindless.. .ghouls!
	
				CHRIS
			Before the outbreak, the experiments
			went further, didn't they? Those...
			ceiling-crawlers out there.. .
	
				ADA
			The product of human DNA spliced
			with the DNA of vicious carnivores...
			animals, even insects. Plated with
			armor, beneath newly cultivated skin.
			Then... injected with poison, so their
			biological components would die.
	
				JILL
			Die.
	
				ADA
			The "T"-virus reactivates them in a
			matter of minutes, but... in battle,
			lost minutes are... inconvenient. So,
			the B.O.W.s had to die... and be allowed
			to revive before they could be used to...
			full advantage. They were murdered...
			by their own people... so they could
			never be murdered again... by the enemy.
	
	
	Pg-72
	
	
				CHRIS
			Were any more of these...weapons...
			developed?
	
	Ada is about to answer, but Wesker interrupts.
	
				WESKER
			HOW DO WE GET INTO "D" LAB?
	
				ADA
			You don't.
	
	Ada glances at an innocuous wall panel. Wesker notices a
	key-slot. Green.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			It can't be opened. Thank God.
			None of us is cleared for that
			level of security.
	
				WESKER
			How fortunate... that I am.
	
	Wesker steps over to the wall and inserts his green card into
	the slot. The panel slides open. Beyond it is a steel door
	with another green slot. Wesker uses his card again. A lock
	CLICKS. Wesker pushes the door open.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Barry. Come with me. The rest of
			you.. .make sure this door doesn't
			close. Remember...
	
	Wesker taps his ear-piece. Everyone gets his meaning. He
	and Barry disappear through the opening. The steel door
	begins to close. Rodriguez lunges, and catches it.
	
				ADA
			Have...you been leaving doors open?
	
				JILL
			Yes.
	
				ADA
			This place is going to be overrun by...
	
				REBECCA
			Brad's in really bad shape.
	
	Brad is leaning against a wall, sweating, shivering. Rebecca
	looks at his wounded leg.
	
				REBECCA (cont.)
			That's not just a scrape. You
			were bitten, weren't you?
	
	
	
	Pg-73
	
				VICKERS
			One...of the sharks. Its teeth.
			I Just...brushed up against its
			teeth...after it was dead.
	
				ADA
			(Alert) Shoot him. Somebody,
			shoot him!
	
				JILL
			No! We're so close. The antidote.
	
	
	INT   STAIRWELL   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER and BARRY trot down a flight of metal stairs.
	
				BARRY
			What's got into you man? This...
			this isn't like you.
	
				WESKER
			Oh, yes, this is exactly like me.
	
	Until now, Wesker has been steadfast. He suddenly seems
	nervous, anxious. Some of it is fear. Most of it is
	anticipation of the goal which is suddenly within reach.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			This is...what I've been all my life.
			A guy... suckin' up to the honchos.
			Wipin' the shit off their asses...
			all the while lookin' for a break.
			A way to get some of my own! Well
			this it, friend. I'm myself,
			alright. And I know exactly what
			I'm doing. I told you...before this
			day was over... I'd pay you back.
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS and JILL step past RODRIGUEZ. They take off down the
	stairs.
	
	As they leave, ADA opens a desk drawer and pulls out a .45.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			(Looking at the gun) You know
			how to use that thing, chica?
	
				ADA
			Of course I do. I'm a scientist.
	
	Pg-74
	
	Ada CLICKS back the bolt, whips up the .45, and aims it at
	BRAD'S head. REBECCA dives in front of the man.
	
				REBECCA
			No! You can't! Not while there's
			still a chance to save him!
	
	
	INT   SAFETY CHAMBER   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER and BARRY arrive at a set of PLEXIGLASS DOORS. They
	can't see through them, they're FOGGED. Wesker finds a key
	slot, inserts his access card, and...
	
	...WHOOSH... the doors open. A CLOUD OF HYPER-COLD MIST
	rushes out, instantly coating the men in FROST. Wesker
	doesn't feel the cold. He doesn't feel anything, except
	a surge of triumph. He steps through the opening into...
	
	
	INT "D" LAB TIMELESS
	
	...a laboratory that looks like-the cockpit of a Concorde...
	only a hundred times larger.. Nothing is, recognizable, except
	desks that hold futuristic-Ibokin computers. A befuddling
	array of BUTTONS, SWITCHES, stuttering LIGHTS, covers every
	inch of wall space.
	
	And at the center of it all stands a tall, cylindrical TANK,
	a stasis tube, filled with ICE. It's mounted on a six-foot
	tall platform, like an altar, with cables and flexible tubes
	running out of it. Wesker squints, and through the freeze,
	sees the thing that stands sedated within the cylinder...
	
	...THE TYRANT. It's nine feet tall. Like the hunters, it
	has more or less human form, though it's musculature is more
	defined than Superman's. One of its arms is scaled to size,
	but the other is much longer. Its hand dangles at knee-
	level. Monstrous steel CLAWS depend from its fingers,
	nearly touching the floor.
	
				WESKER
			(In awe) It's called... the Tyrant.
			Nobody knows it exists. Except us...
			and Holden.
	
				BARRY
			Holden?
	
				WESKER
			Umbrella's man in D.C. We need him.
			He signs the checks. (Excited) We've
			got it, Barry! Our fortune!
	
	
	Pg-75
	
				BARRY
			You're not gonna try to get this
			big mother outta here ?
	
				WESKER
			Don't have to. All we need is the
			data. Then.. .these things can be
			cranked out on an assembly line!
	
	Laying down his automatic, WESKER hits computer keys until
	a DISK pops out of a master-feed.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			YES! This is it!
	
				BARRY
			What about the antidote?
	
				WESKER
			Antidote? (Laughing) There is no
			antidote. That was just happy horse
			shit, to keep the team going.
	
	Neither man notices... that the removal of the master disk has
	caused certain systems to fail... indicated by red lights, and
	by the fact that... the walls of the Tyrant's cylinder are
	beginning to run liquid sweat. The ice... is MELTING.
	
				BARRY
			You're gonna give this to Umbrella?
	
				WESKER
			No. I'm gonna sell it to them. Then
			I'm gonna open a Swiss bank account...
			right next to yours.
	
				JILL (o.s.)
			God...damn!
	
	JILL has appeared in the doorway with CHRIS. They both
	at the monster with awe...and terror.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			That thing... can't be real!
	
				WESKER
			It's real, alright. And it's worth...
			more than gold. More than uranium!
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Do we get a piece of that action?
	
	ROSIE has arrived. So have REBECCA, ADA, and the two
	surviving SCIENTISTS.
	
	Pg-76
	
				WESKER
			All of you do. Anyone who comes out
			of this alive... gets a taste.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (o.s.)
			I'm in. I been eatin' shit all my
			life. I'm happy to eat some more...
			as long as it's got some gravy on it.
	
	Rosie steps into the lab, her weapon ready.
	
				WESKER
			Anybody else see it my way?
	
	One of the scientists, TOSHIRO, rushes to join.
	
				ADA
			(To Toshiro) You disgrace yourself!
	
				TOSHIRO
			I...I want to live.
	
				WESKER
			Smart. Anyone else? Valentine?
	
	Jill looks at Chris. Then she steps through the doorway and
	takes a defensive post beside her c.o.
	
				CHRIS
			And I was gonna try to disarm the
			bomb. This place should be destroyed!
			It needs to be destroyed!
	
	Chris lifts his rifle. Wesker is faster with his pistol,
	aiming it at Chris' belly.
	
				WESKER
			Gotcha, son. It's only because
			of Valentine, here, that I didn't
			squeeze the trigger.
	
	Chris and Jill exchange dagger eyes.
	
				CHRIS
			If she's on your side... she doesn't
			mean shit to me. And I don't mean
			shit to her.
	
				JILL
			Chris, please. There's only... one
			way to go, here .
	
				WESKER
			That's right. My way!
	
	
	Pg-77
	
	
				JILL
			Yes, sir. Your way!
	
	Jill presses in close to Wesker, as if completely allied.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			I...can't yell you, Chris...how much
			I wanted...things to have turned out
			differently. (Beat) Goodbye.
	
	Swiftly, unexpectedly, Jill snatches the detonator wire and
	pulls the sensor out of Wesker's ear.
	
	Everyone shuts their eyes, expecting to be blown sky-high.
	
	Nothing happens.
	
	Jill pulls the detonator off Wesker's belt. She stares
	small LED screen which reads... 14:42:16... 15... 14...
	
				JILL (cont.)
			Shit. I got all my courage up...
			and we still have fifteen minutes!
	
	Jill tosses the detonator to Chris. Wesker turns on her,
	lifting his M-16...
	
				BARRY
			You shoot. I shoot, boss.
	
	Wesker turns to find Barry's weapon aiming at his belly.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			Shit.. here I am still callin'
			you 'boss'.
	
	Wesker is holding the data-disk. Suddenly, he feels it
	snatched away...by Ada, who has rushed into the room.
	
	He aims his weapon at her back as she darts away. Before
	he can fire, he's KICKED in the head... by Jill. Buckling,
	dazed, he looks up at her.
	
				JILL
			We believed in you. I believed
			in you. Boy, was I a sucker.
	
	She kicks him again, just for the hell of it. He flops on
	the floor, his eye-socket swollen. He's dropped his gun.
	
	He gropes for it. Barry steps in and boots it away.
	
	A KLAXON SOUNDS! Emergency!
	
	The ice in the Tyrant's tank has melted down to a critical
	level. The monster... is beginning to MOVE.
	
	
	Pg-78
	
	Reaching the doorway, Ada hears a mechanism TRIP in the jamb.
	The Plexiglas doors begin to slide shut. Ada strains to
	hold them back.
	
				ADA
			Get out! Now! Or you never will!
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			So... we'll live here! (Glancing at
			the Tyrant) No. The landlord looks
			like a sonuvabitch.
	
	Rosie rushes in to help Ada hold the doors. So does
	BENJAMIN, the second of the surviving scientists, who is...
	...MAULED from behind by a ZOMBIE. It's not just any zombie.
	It's BRAD VICKERS, back from death, who BITES out the artery
	in Benjamin's neck.
	
				ADA
			I TOLD YOU... TO SHOOT HIM!
	
	Ada lifts her .45 and blows Vickers way. She looks down
	at Benjamin, writhing on the floor, aims at his head... and
	FIRES again.
	
	Rodriguez is the only one holding the doors. Jill rushes
	to help her.
	
				JILL
			Everybody! OUT!
	
				CHRIS
			(Off the LED) Thirteen minutes.
	
	Inside the lab, Barry turns to Toshiro, the other scientist.
	
				BARRY
			Go.
	
	Toshiro hesitates... a second too long. KRAAASSSH! The
	stasis tube BURSTS open. WATER and bits of ICE fly out...
	along with an enormous, bionic HAND. Big-enough to grab
	Toshiro's head as if it were a cantaloupe. Powerful enough
	to CRUSH that head as if it were... well, a cantaloupe.
	
	Wesker, still searching for his pistol, sees all this.
	
	The Tyrant is not completely free. Much of the cylinder
	wall has cracked away, but sections of it cling to a now
	misshapen mass of ice that still holds the monster bound.
	Though it won1t for much longer.
	
	Wesker starts toward the door. Barry grabs the back of his
	shirt and pitches him across the lab.
	
	
	Pg-79
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			You and me... we ain't goin' nowhere.
			Not just now, boss.
	
	Barry turns to the others clustered at the doorway.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			This thing gets loose, it's gonna
			be pissed. Somebody's gotta hold it

				JILL
			LOOK OUT!
	
	Wesker has found his pistol. He FIRES at Barry who, ducking,
	is only GRAZED. Wesker aims at the group in the doorway.
	Barry pops out from behind a desk and shoots back at him.
	
	Ada and Rebecca duck away from the doors, pulling Rodriguez
	and a reluctant Jill after them. The doors begin to slide
	closed. Chris valiantly tries to prevent them from shutting.
	
	Wesker CRAWLS lke a dog. He manages to fling an arm
	out through the opening. Steel bumpers press on the meat
	of his forearm. Wesker looks up. Through the Plexiglas,
	his eyes meet Chris'.
	
				WESKER
			Get me outta here, Redfield. Or so
			help me God, you're a dead man.
	
	With his free hand, Wesker aims his pistol at Chris. The gun
	barrel is an intimidating sight, even though it's on the other
	side of the plexi. Chris glances at the others.
	
				CHRIS
			Get going.
	
				JILL
			Not without...
	
				CHRIS
			MOVE!
	
	Ada, Rebecca and Rodriguez wrestle Jill away bodily, and
	start up the metal stairway.
	
				WESKER
			COME BACK! RODRIGUEZ! VALENTINE!
			THAT'S AN ORDER !
	
				CHRIS
			Orders don't mean shit any more,
			Wesker. Especially when they come
			from sell-out bastards like you.
	
	
	
	Pg-80
	
	Chris lets go. The doors squeeze tighter. Wesker SCREAMS.
	
	Through the plexi, Chris catches a glimpse of Barry, who
	stands and gives him a military salute. Chris salutes back.
	
	BLAM BLAM BLAM... Wesker FIRES three rounds. Dusty blemishes
	appear on the bulletproof glass. The slugs ricochet back
	into the lab.
	
	One of them CHIPS away at the ICE which is less and less
	able to contain the Tyrant.
	
	Chris makes a break for the stairs. Wesker twists his body
	in an attempt to push his pistol through the opening, but his
	fist, around the stock, is too thick. Nonetheless, Wesker
	FIRES .BLAM BLAM BLAM... bullets SCREAM off the banister
	rails, but none of them contact Chris' legs which disappear
	up the stairs.
	
	The ice in the stasis tube is turning to slush. The Tyrant
	is about to break loose. Wesker looks pleadingly at Barry.
	
				WESKER
			B-buddy. You gotta get us out.
	
				BARRY
			Not sure I know how, boss. Do you?
			Is there some other...'need-to-know'
			secret for shutting down the Big
			Bopper, here?
	
				WESKER
			No. It.. it can't be shut down.
	 
				BARRY
			The ultimate warrior. The ultimate
			soldier. We'll see. How it does
			against a couple of hard-ass career
			guys, like you and me.
	
	WESKER swings his free arm and aims his pistol at BARRY.
	CLICK! The gun is empty.
	
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
	The ESCAPEES arrive in the security cubicle.

	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	The multi-faceted CORRIDOR TWISTS into a new configuration

				ADA
			You won't come out in the same place.
			But you'll find a freight loader that
			can be accessed with...
	
				JILL
			...a blue key. I hope.
	
				ADA
			No. Pot blue or green. Red.
	
	Ada pulls a RED KEY from under her lab coat, snaps the chain
	on her neck, and holds it out to Chris.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			I took it from an Umbrella agent
			assigned to us here. He died...

				CHRIS
			Red... overrides green.
	
				ADA
			Yes.

			So... you could have unlocked "D" lab.
	
				ADA
			I was hoping it would never be un-
			locked again. Go. I will see that
			this.. .(she holds up the data disk) ...
			is destroyed.
	
	Chris grabs Ada's arm and holds it tight while he wrenches
	the disk away from her.
	
	He folds it over onto itself, drops it to the floor, and
	pumps three Winchester rounds into it.
	
				CHRIS
			It's destroyed. It's worthless
			But you're not.
	
				ADA
			I helped develop it!

			Unwittingly. They lied to you.
			They lied to Marcus. They made
			you believe you were doing a good

			It was evil!
	
	Ada looks deeply into Chris' eyes.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			The kind of evil that... resides
			in all of us. Makes us... greedy,
			uncaring. The kind of evil that
			will... wipe us out, in the end.
			Unless we stand up against it.
	
				ADA
			Stand up? Against powers that have...
			ruled the world since before we were
			born? We will only be...eliminated.
			Or locked away someplace else. I'd
			rather die here. Knowing that the

	Jill takes a step toward Ada.
	
				JILL
			What if it's already spread? You're
			the only one...who knew anything
			about it.
	
				ADA
			(The thought penetrating) But, I...
			know so little.
	 
				 CHRIS
			More than anyone else. You have...
			a responsibility.
	
				JILL
			To a higher command. The highest.
	
	She and Chris touch eyes again, this time with understanding.
	
	
	INT   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
	
	THE TYRANT flexes its monumental muscles. The ice around
	it CRACKS... but clings. The giant HEART dangling outside
	its chest PUMPS rapidly...sending fluids through exposed
	synthetic veins that run to the creature's brain.
	
				BARRY
			That's one helluva big pump.

				WESKER
			An implant.
	
				BARRY
			From what? A fuckin' elephant?
	
				WESKER
			Rhinoceros.
	
				BARRY
			Shit. I figured you knew more than
			you were telling.
	
	Barry FIRES at the encased organ. His bullets bounce off the
	shielding with no effect.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			How do we kill this thing?
	
				WESKER
			I told you, we don't. W-we can't.
			It's unstoppable!
	
	More ICE pops off the monster's pectorals.

			I don't know if I can face this.
	
	She and the ESCAPEES are no longer in the Cubicle. They're
	in the runway.
	
				CHRIS
			Just get us upstairs. I'll take
			care of it from there.
	
				ADA
			Alright. (With a sigh) Come.
	
	They break out, at the run, klacking along the faceted steel
	floor of the movable... and still moving.. .corridor.
	
	KRUNNNGGG! They're nearly knocked off their feet when the
	system suddenly STOPS DEAD.
	
	Ada slams her fist into one of those JIGSAW TILES on the
	wall. Another RED one, which glows from within.
	
	A PANEL grinds open, revealing...
	
	
	
	Pg-84
	
	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	...a more natural-looking corridor. Half-way along, there
	are STEEL PRONGS that protrude from a wall. The group starts
	toward them...but stops when a soul-shriveling SOUND fills
	the passageway...the hungry MOANING of things that are dead.
	
				ADA
			Doors... were left open.
	
	INT   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
	
	The TYRANT BREAKS free of the last bit of restricting ice.
	WESKER FREAKS. Whimpering, he gropes with his hand that's
	outside the Plexiglas doors. He grabs something. A BOOT.
	Brad Vickers' boot. Wesker tugs on it.
	
	BARRY opens fire on the Tyrant, full bore, with his M-16.
	The stream of bullets does nothing except make the monster
	notice the big man.
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	THE ESCAPEES run down the corridor. SHAPES appear at the
	far end. ZOMBIES! Twenty. Thirty. Forty. More. The
	walking remains of humans who were infected in the labs,
	crawling over each other, hungry for living flesh.
	
	The humans reach the FREIGHT LOADER. Prongs, like those on
	a fork lift, extend from a heavy chain-drive that runs up
	and down through openings in the floor and ceiling.
	ADA swipes her red key through a slot and pushes a button.
	The chain-drive Grinds upward, hoisting the prongs.
	
				ADA
			Step on.
	
	Ada pushes REBECCA onto the next set of prongs that come up
	out of the floor. The footing is precarious. Rebecca has
	to hold on to the chain as she is hoisted.
	
	The lift moves slowly, eight feet separating each set of
	prongs.
	
	The ghouls continue to press in.
	
				JILL
			I don't know if it's gonna happen.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Come on. I been waitin' all day
			for somthin. like this.
	
	
	Pg-85
	
	Rosie opens FIRE. Chris and Jill follow suit as Ada steps
	onto the next set of prongs.
	
	Blood FLIES. Skulls SHATTER. Front ranks drop. Zombies
	from behind push their fallen comrades ahead of them. The
	corridor is like a syringe filled with corrupted bodies,
	pushing inexorably forward.
	
	Rosie, teeth gritted, keeps firing while Chris forces Jill
	onto the next set of prongs. As she rises, she hands her
	M-16 to Chris. He slings it on his arm while levering his
	old Winchester, making each of his shots count, until the
	next set of prongs rises out of the floor.
	
				CHRIS
			(To Rosie) You're up.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			I'm havin' too much fun. You got
			a lady. I just got me. Anyway...
			I ain't gonna die in this rat hole.
			I'll make it. Get outta here.
	
	Chris hands Jill's rifle to Rosie, who fires with both hands
	as Chris jumps onto the lift.
	
	Zombies are MOWED DOWN. But more come. The syringe keeps
	pressing.
	
	The next prongs rise. Rosie steps on, still blasting..
	The first zombies reach her. Shooting down, she blows them
	away. But more come, grabbing her legs, grabbing the chains,
	ROCKING the prongs. Rosie nearly falls. She drops one of
	the rifles in order to hold on. She carefully picks off the
	most threatening zombies. Miraculously, she rises out of
	their reach, and into...
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	...a very tight, very dark SPACE with sheet metal walls that
	have been bruised by loads of freight. The rumble of the
	chain-drive ECHOES frighteningly.
	
	ABOVE ROSIE, THE OTHERS rise slowly... very slowly... feeling
	apprehensive, vulnerable. REBECCA, at the top, looks up and
	sees LIGHT spilling through an opening through which she is
	about to pass.
	
				ADA
			(Calling up to her) Level "C".
			Have your weapons ready.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			(From below) Whoop-de-doo.
	
	
	Pg-86
	
	Rebecca's eyes rise above the floor of Level "C". All seems
	quiet... but who knows what might be lurking.
	
	
	INT "D" LAB TIMELESS
	
	THE TYRANT, still a bit sluggish, steps down from the
	platform that supported its tank. BARRY jams in a fresh
	clip and keeps firing at the thing. The Tyrant, impervious,
	stalks after the big trooper.
	
	Wesker is still on the floor, his arm through the doors,
	tugging on Vickers' boot.
	
	The flesh on Wesker's forearm is PEELED by the bumpers as
	he uses all his strength to drag Vickers' body closer...
	until the boot winds up in the opening, preventing the doors
	from closing.
	Wesker manages to pull his bloody arm free. He rushes to
	a computer console and types a request for the "T"-virus.
	
				BARRY
			Get under a desk, man. I'm gonna
			feed this thing a pineapple.
	
	Barry pulls a GRENADE from his belt.
	
				WESKER
			NO! It might damage the system!
			I've got to get this data!
	
	Wesker's M-16 has been lying, where he left it, on the
	console. He picks it up.
	
				BARRY
			Forget it. Bullets don't work!
	
	Barry is about to pull the pin on the grenade when Wesker
	triggers off A BURST...into BARRY'S GUT!
	
				WESKER
			They seem to work just fine.
	
	Barry is BLASTED across the lab.
	
	The Tyrant makes its first quick move... making us appreciate
	how fast and powerful it really is. It swipes at Barry's
	body as it flies through the air, catching it in it's steel
	claw. We hears BONES SNAP as Barry goes limp.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			That's it. Take a little lunch
			break, Mr. "T". I just need a few
			more seconds.
	
	Pg-87
	
	The Tyrant lifts Barry's body, as if it were as light as a
	feather, up to its snout. Recognizing that the man is dead,
	the monster FLINGS him aside like so much garbage... and
	begins to lumber toward Wesker.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			(To the computer) Come on, come on.. .
	
	A monitor reads: 90% COMPLETE...95%...98%. Wesker rests
	a finger on the button to eject a floppy.
	
	The Tyrant is getting closer by the second. Wesker FIRES
	a burst at it which only slows it for a heartbeat.
	
	100%.. .TRANSFER COMPLETED. Wesker ejects the floppy, jams
	it into his flack-jacket, and, FIRING another burst, runs
	for the door. The Tyrant has to move around desks and
	computer consoles to catch him.
	
	Wesker shoves his M-16 through the space that's being held
	open by Vickers' boot. He begins to pry the opening wider.
	A WARNING BUZZER goes off. The Tyrant dimly registers
	the sound. Its eyes dilate, like camera shutters, with
	a CLI-CLICK. It strides forward at top peed, PITCHING
	DESKS easily aside, SMASHING through a CONSOLE as if it
	were made of balsa.
	
	Wesker has pried the doors wide. The Tyrant is coming at
	him FAST. It's going to be very close.
	
	Wesker MAKES IT. He gets outside. The doors begin to glide
	shut. He LAUGHS!
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			EAT SHIT, YOU...
	
	THLANNG! The Tyrant's long, bionic CLAWS SHOOT, with the
	speed of switch-blades, through the opening, just before the
	doors meet. FOUR of the claws SKEWER WESKER, passing clean
	through him.
	
	He doesn't die instantly. He's still alive and SCREAMING
	when the Tyrant uses the same hand, with Wesker impaled on
	it, to PUSH the doors open wide again. The action causes
	WESKER'S HEAD to be SLICED OFF by one of the steel bumpers.
	The Tyrant steps out of the lab. As the doors glide shut,
	the monster holds the remainder of Wesker's body inside
	their path.
	
	The bumpers are stopped by the Tyrant's iron hand... which
	it extracts, letting the doors scrape the dead meat from
	its claws.

	THE CORRIDOR on Level "B" is long and narrow, with only
	occasional pools of LIGHT from bare, overhanging bulbs.
	REBECCA rises, like a spirit, out of the floor. She lifts
	her weapon. Her eyes dart, looking for dangers. There are
	none. The corridor, while very spooky, is quiet.
	
				REBECCA
			Don't see anything.
	
				ADA
			Good.
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	REBECCA rises through the ceiling.
	
				ADA
			We're almost there. You'll have
			to jump off. The belt won't stop.
	
	As the ECHO of Ada's voice rings off, Rebecca looks up and...
	...SCREEEE... SOMETHING dives down on her out of the darkness.
	She ducks, almost losing her balance. She clings to the
	chain as OTHER THINGS...black, relatively small.. .WHIP past
	her head.
	
				REBECCA
			Bats! There are bats in here!
	
				ADA
			No. They're crows! Infected!
			Don't let them bite you!
	
	Rebecca dodges with new urgency as the black birds dive past
	her. Looking up, she sees more coming. She aims her M-16
	and fires up the shaft. TWO BIRDS are HIT. They plummet.
	One hits ADA. She swats it aside. It drops all the way
	down to ROSIE, who JUMPS, gasping, when it hits her.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Rats. FLYING RATS!
	
	
	Pg-89
	
	Beneath her, Rosie sees the crows hovering in the light from
	Level "B"... They circle, then start to fly up again.
	Rosie opens fire, filling the shaft with ribbons of lead.
	Another BIRD dives from above and... SKIT... takes a chunk
	out of Rosie's cheek.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			AAAH ! YOU FUCKER !
	
				CHRIS
			(From above) You alright?
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Yeah. I'm cool. I'm... cool.
	
	Rosie keeps FIRING. The deafening SOUND of her M-16 keeps
	her from hearing a...
	
	...KRATTCH...in the sheet-metal wall. A second later...
	
	...RRRRRIPPP! The metal is torn open like tissue-paper.
	
	SOMETHING dark lunges from the opening. It's the surviving
	HUNTER! One of its steel claws GRABS the chain-drive. The
	mechanism stops dead.
	
	QUICK CUTS: of THE ESCAPEES slipping, nearly falling, as they
	hang on to the chain.
	
				REBECCA
			I thought it wasn't supposed to stop.
	
				ADA
			Climb out. OUT!
	
	Rebecca has nearly reached Level "A"... She's able to hoist
	herself up, and roll to safety.
	
	Ada tries to climb. The chain is GREASY. Her hands slip.
	BELOW, the Hunter lets go of the mechanism. The chain JERKS.
	The escapees nearly lose their balance again.
	
	Rosie, at the bottom, is being lifted toward the Hunter's
	free hand. She JUMPS down. Barely catching the next set
	of prongs beneath her.
	
	AT THE TOP, Ada reaches Level "A". Rebecca catches her and
	pulls her up onto Level "A..
	
	Jill is next, rising slowly. Rebecca and Ada reach down and
	grab her arms just as... TCHUNG... the mechanism stops again.
	The Hunter has grabbed the chain again. Its free hand
	swings, clutching at Rosie, who crouches, avoiding capture.
	
	
	
	Pg-90
	
	Jill is pulled to safety. She turns and reaches down for
	Chris, who starts to climb the chain, his hands slipping on
	the grease.
	
				CHRIS
			ROSIE!?
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			I'M ALRIGHT!
	
	She's not alright. She's trapped. She can't get up past
	the Hunter. She FIRES at the thing. Bullets BOUNCE off its
	protective steel under-hide.
	
	Chris climbs three feet. Slides back two. The others reach
	down from above. Their hands come within inches, but can't
	quite catch hold of him.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			Here! Here, you... lizard. You
			fuckin' cockroach, HERE!
	
	Straining to reach Rosie, the hunter lets go of the chain
	for a second, then latches on again. That second lifts
	Chris to within reach of Jill and the others. They grab
	his arms. Lift him up.
	
	That second has also brought Rosie within reach of the
	Hunter. Its claws COMB her hair as she tries to duck lower
	while keeping her balance on the prongs.
	
	THWAKK! SOMETHING crashes through the wall. A MONSTROUS
	CLAW that IMPALES the Hunter. It's the claw of THE TYRANT!
	
	The chain mechanism begins to rise again. Rosie, cringing,
	is lifted past the monster just as it leans its head and
	shoulders into the shaft to examine what it has caught.
	
	Disappointed, the Tyrant SCRAPES the Hunter off its claw.
	It drops away down the shaft.
	
	The Tyrant turns its CLICKING, dilating eyes up at Rosie,
	and...TCHUNNNGG...purposely STOPS the rising chain.

	Rosie DIVES off the prongs...directly at the Tyrant. With

	and sends her up first. ADA begins to climb. Then REBECCA.
	
	The Tyrant closes in, SWIPING at Chris, who just manages to
	avoid the SLICE of its mighty claw.
	
	The RADIO MAN leans out of the door above, holding something.

	Jill pitches the weapon. Chris catches it. The Tyrant is
	on him, about to STOMP him with a bionic FOOT when...
	
	...Chris aims at the monster's rhinoceros heart and FIRES!
	
	The rocket CONNECTS, on target. The casing around the animal
	heart EXPLODES... and the Tyrant drops like a giant Redwood...
	
	...on top of Chris's legs.
	
	As Chris tries to free himself, he checks the detonator.
	THREE MINUTES. TWO-FIFTY-NINE. EIGHT. SEVEN. SIX.
	
	LaGuardia drops his chopper a bit lower. The bottom of the
	ladder hits the ground, coming within Chris' reach. He grabs
	on. The helicopter rises again. Chris is pulled out from
	under the Tyrant's steel body and is LIFTED into the air.
	He climbs frantically.
	
	Above him, Jill is still on the ladder as well. Ada and
	Rebecca pull her up. Chris DANGLES as the Huey banks away
	over the forest. The tops of TREES whip his legs, but he
	hangs on, climbing up... up... until the others catch his
	hands and hoist him into the chopper. Chris checks the LED.
	ONE MINUTE, FORTY-FIVE SECONDS.
	
				JILL
			(Reading over Chris' shoulder) We
			have to get out of range.
	
				CHRIS
			No. (To the pilot) Circle around.
			
				LAGUARDIA
			Are there more survivors?
	
				CHRIS
			No. Just...circle, okay? I want
			to...take a last look.
	
	The Huey banks into a circle. Chris looks down at...
	
	
	EXT   AERIAL POV   DAY
	
	...the MANSION. And just over the hills...HIS FARM.
	
	
	INT   HUEY   DAY
	
				JILL
			It's... your home.
	
	CHRIS looks at her, with a resigned smile.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-95
				CHRIS
			I hoped... it would be our home.
	
				JILL
			I guess... we're gonna be moving.
	
	Chris checks the LED. THIRTY-EIGHT SECONDS.
	
				CHRIS
			(To the pilot) Full throttle.
			Out of here, man!
	
	LaGuardia pushes his stick. The Huey LUNGES forward at
	top speed. REBECCA, ADA and JILL are pressed back by
	inertia. Chris holds himself erect. Through the window,
	in the receding sky, he spots...
	
	...AN EAGLE, riding the wind.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	EXT   THE ARKLEY FOREST   THE MANSION   DAY
	
	PLOOOOMMMMM! The GROUND ERUPTS from an enormous under-
	ground explosion. The MANSION is reduced to particulate
	as the shock-wave spreads outward.
	
	
	EXT   FARM   DAY
	
	Chris' farm hand, RAKE, is shambling out of the house, a
	ZOMBIE... when the EXPLOSIVE FORCE HITS, tearing him APART.
	
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   DAY
	
	The TOWN is EMPTY...except for NINE LONELY FIGURES, lumbering
	down Main Street. They, too...are ZOMBIES. The hot wave
	HITS. Two are VAPORIZED. FIRE engulfs two more. The BRAINS
	of two others are DESTROYED by flying debris.. .
	
	...which catches the remaining three, as well. Arms are
	torn off. Iron shafts from shattered plumbing, shards of
	window glass, slats from picket fences... PUNCH through
	necks, chests, bellies...
	
	...but the dead things, their skulls undamaged,
	through billows of dust... drooling hungrily.
	
	THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.

	PRESENTATION CREDITS appear... then FADE...
	
	Out of BLACK... SHOCK CUT TO:
	
	INT   LAB   "A" LEVEL   TIMELESS
	
	A MAN'S FACE, filling the screen.
	
				MARCUS (filter)
			Stay away from here!
	
	We're watching A VIDEO MONITOR. A pre-recorded tape shows
	a view of what is obviously a pristine-RESEARCH LABORATORY.
	DR. JOHN MARCUS, in a lab coat, faces THE CAMERA, disheveled
	and looking like a madman.
	
				MARCUS (cont. filter)
			This lab must remain sealed!
	
	INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	Overhead lamps cast pools of LIGHT down onto A CONFERENCE
	TABLE, onto THE HANDS of PEOPLE assembled to observe the
	video. We see NO FACES. But expensive WATCHES, sleeves
	with high-ranking STRIPES, indicate wealth, power, and a
	military presence.
	
	THE VIDEO: On the wall behind MARCUS, we see SHADOWS darting
	frantically. We hear VOICES rising in panic.
	
				MARCUS (cont. Filter)
			For God's sake, don't come in!
	
	The CAMERA is SWATTED by A HAND that lurches suddenly into
	the foreground. We only see it for a few video frames, but
	we might subliminally notice LESIONS on the flesh. The IMAGE
	SWIRLS wildly. The next clear picture we see... is of the
	same laboratory...topsy-turvy. THE CAMERA is lying on its
	side on the floor.
	
				VOICE IN THE ROOM (o.s.)
			Look.  Here.
	
	A LASER POINTER casts a RED DOT on a corner of the video
	screen, indicating A HUNCHED FIGURE, leaning over A HUMAN
	BODY, apparently ...feeding! With a GRUNT, the figure turns.
	and LUNGES, it's face covered with BLOOD, at the CAMERA. The
	image SWIRLS again, and the SCREEN GOES BLACK. With a MUSIC
	STING, a single TITLE appears, full across the blackness...
	
			        RESIDENT EVIL
	
	
	Pg-2
	
	EXT  FOREST LAND   PRE-DAWN
	
	A DARK SKY ...and in the foreground, profiled against a FULL
	MOON, A DARK FACE ...watching the heavens with piercing black
	eyes, alert, though not predatory. This is CHRIS REDFIELD,
	young, handsome. More than simply an outdoor type, he seems
	perfectly in place, almost part of the environment.
	
	A band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of
	magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. Sitting
	on a ridge, squinting into that band of light, Chris sees ...
	
	...AN EAGLE coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through
	the hilltops. As the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes
	recognizable. Chris smiles and jots a note on a pad.
	
	The regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly...
	a freshwater trout lies flapping, three-thousand feet above
	the highest water.
	
				CHRIS
			Take it, Goliath. It's yours.
	
	"Goliath" snaps up the fish and flies away with it.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			See ya next year, guy.
	
	Chris reaches into a water-filled bucket, pulls out another
	trout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious
	Cliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the-same high rock.
	ANOTHER EAGLE, smaller, a female, appears in the sky.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Cleopatra.
	
	Chris scrambles back to his place and jots another note.
	
	"Cleopatra" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down.
	She's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she
	recoils and climbs again, hovering.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Come on. Come on down.
	
	The eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning. It makes another
	dive, but stops short again.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			What's the matter, beautiful?
	
	The bird seems frightened.  Of what? It makes one more dive.
	Gets very close to the fish... but suddenly SHRIEKS and peels,
	away from the rock. Chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as
	it soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair.
	
	
	Pg-3
	
	CLOSE ON: CHRIS, concerned, as he watches the eagle disappear
	over the hills.
	
	Over his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the
	fish. It's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight
	catches SOMETHING MOVING there. Something that lets out a
	sharp INHUMAN SOUND.
	
	Chris whirls around. There's nothing on the rock. Nothing
	at all. The fish has been taken.
	
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   DAWN
	
	CHRIS walks into a characterless apartment. He quietly
	sheds his clothes. Even in silhouette, we can see that his
	body is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight.
	Moving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases
	himself into a bed where...
	
	...a beautiful young girl, JILL VALENTINE, seems to be fast
	asleep. As Chris nestles in beside her, we see that her
	eyes, facing away, are open. Chris gently drapes an arm
	around her and lets his body relax.
	
				CHRIS
			(A whisper) Glad you're still 
			here, lady
	
				JILL
			It's my apartment.
	
				CHRIS
			(Surprised) You're awake.
	
				JILL
			I've been awake. Since you left.
	
				CHRIS
			Sorry.
	
	His apology goes no further. He's still troubled by what
	happened in the hills.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			There was... something wrong.
	
				JILL
			What, with my dinner? I never had
			a mother. I'll learn.
	
	Chris smiles politely. He offers...
	
				CHRIS
			I'll do the cooking.
	
	
	Pg-4
	
	...but he can't switch focus.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			On the mountain...there...must
			have been something... prowling
			around up there.
	
				JILL
			There are probably all kinds of
			things prowling around up there.
			In the middle of the night.
	
	Chris apologizes again, this time more sincerely.
	
				CHRIS
			I'm sorry. Really. You...have to
			be there at dawn. They ride the
			wind over the ridge.
	
				JILL
			Dawn? You left at one A.M.
	
				CHRIS
			I had to go fishing. It's the fish
			that bring them down, so I can get
			a close look at them. (Enthused)
			I've tracked a dozen of them, Jill.
			Twelve of those big bruisers. I can
			actually recognize them. I've even
			given them names, over the years.
	
				JILL
			You've been doing this for years?
	
				CHRIS
			Only in the early Autumn. When
			they're' migrating.
	
				JILL
			I'II set the alarm for next. October.
	
	Jill rolls over and faces him.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			I wish I could get excited. Really.
			That's the truth. As excited as you,
			over such... simple things.
	
				CHRIS
			Beauty... isn't simple. If it was...
			I'd be beautiful.
	
				JILL
			You are.
	
	Pg-5
	
				CHRIS
			No, no, no.  I'm simple.  You, on the
			other hand...(nuzzling closer)...have
			all that... stuff... hiding underneath
			somewhere. That's what fascinates me.
	
				JILL
			Fascination. Not love?
	
	Jill is being playful. Chris, taking her question to heart,
	becomes introspective.
	
				CHRIS
			I... honestly don't know. I guess
			I've been... living alone too long.
			You're the first, the only woman I've
			ever thought of as... a real partner.
	
	Now Jill becomes introspective.
	
				JILL
			I've always been...afraid of living
			alone. I've always had... people...
			talking at me... knowing they could
			wind me up and I'd do... (shrug) ...
			whatever they wanted.
	
	Chris looks into her eyes. She kisses him gently.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			We all have... something hidden...
			underneath.  Beauty may not be simple.
			But it's not all that complicated,
			Either.  Most of the time, you find
			It... right in the middle of all the...
			confusion.
	
				CHRIS
			I'm part Mohawk. Indians are never
			confused. At least, they never let
			it show.
	
	They kiss again, this time more passionately. Rolling over,
	they begin to make love.
	
	EXT   FARM   DAWN
	The purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite
	dark when a crusty old farm-hand, RAKE, opens the creaking
	door of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads THREE HORSES
	out into the morning breeze.
	
	Two dogs, A LAB and A SPANIEL, romp at his heels as Rake
	opens a log gate.
	
	Pg-6
	-
	Two of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large
	corral. The third, a beautiful stallion, resists, snorting,
	tossing its head in high spirit.
	
				RAKE
			Get in there, Lucky. Quit horsin'
			around. Get in.
	
	"LUCKY" moves into the corral, strutting proudly.
	
				RAKE (cont.)
			Swear. If I didn't know you was
			just an animal, I'd say you was all
			full of yourself. GET IN THERE!
	
	Rake waves his flashlight, not meanly, there is clearly a
	great deal of affection here. Rake shuts the gate behind
	the stallion, who begins to gallop around happily inside
	the fence. All seems lovely, until...
	
	...the dogs suddenly go on point. Their ears perk. They
	sniff the air...and begin to WHINE.
	
				RAKE (cont.)
			What's wrong with you two?
	
	KER-RAAKK! A startling SOUND. Rake turns to find Lucky and
	the other horses, their eyes flaring, trying to KICK their
	way out of the fencing. They seem terrified.
	
	CUT TO :
	
	A WIDE SHOT:  of RAKE, and the frightened ANIMALS, from
	two hundred yards away. THE CAMERA MOVES IN, slowly at
	first, then gaining speed... extraordinary SPEED. We are
	seeing THROUGH THE EYES OF... whatever it is that's running,
	charging, SLATHERING HUNGRILY...
	
	...reaching the corral, DARTING through the fence, past the
	KICKING HORSES, and LEAPING at Rake, who whirls around...and
	CRIES OUT in pain as his flashlight BLINDS us with WHITENESS.
	
	EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
	
	The WHITENESS becomes the GLARE of HALOGEN LIGHTS. We are
	overwhelmed by the SOUND of AIRCRAFT ENGINES. We see MEN,
	armed SOLDIERS, scrambling into combat HELICOPTERS.
	
	A RADIO MAN runs right toward THE CAMERA, holding out an
	open receiver.
	
				RADIO MAN
			Top brass, sir!
	
	
	Pg-7
	
	ANOTHER MAN, in the foreground, takes the radio-phone. We
	can't see his face. Only his forearm, which bears A TATTOO
	of a grinning SKULL.
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO
			Alpha Leader.
	
				VOICE ON PHONE (o.s. filter)
			How long before you get in there?
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO
			Fifteen minutes.
	
	INT   AN OFFICE   DAWN
	
	A SUIT talks on a red telephone. Once again, we see no face.
	An ostentatious diamond RING kicks light as the man snips off
	the end off a Monte Cristo.
	
				MAN WITH RING
			You're good, soldier. But not that
			good. It's five hundred miles away.
			In the backwoods of Pennsylvania.
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO (o.s. filter)
			We have troopers on site. A first-
			strike force. Under cover.
	
	The flame from a wooden match lights the Monte Cristo.
	
				MAN WITH RING
			Very resourceful.  You have my
			permission activate them.
	
	EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
	
				MAN WITH TATTOO
			I've already done that. You have my
			permission... to say that you gave me
			permission.
	
	THE TATTOOED MAN runs off to join the other SOLDIERS.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	CHRIS sleeps. JILL is awake, deep in thought, when...
	
	...BRRRRT! It's not a ring, it's a vibration. Jill reaches
	down and extracts something small and black, the size of a
	box of Tic-Tacs, from one of her shoes. She gets out of bed,
	checking to see that Chris is still asleep, and moves into...
	
	
	Pg-8
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   BATHROOM   MORNING
	
	...a bathroom. Closing the door behind her, she puts the
	small box to her ear, extracts a wire from it, with a tiny
	microphone on its tip, and...
	
				JILL
			(Softly) Valentine.
	
	We can't hear the voice that speaks to her.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			If this is just another a drill,
			I'll strangle you. (She listens)
			Shit. Give me the activation code.
	
	JILL pulls a small ENVELOPE from a toiletry bag. She breaks
	open a wax seal...and takes out a thick paper on which is
	printed... 29-RC-6735.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			(Gaping, not believing) Th-that's
			a match. (Beat) I'm on my way.
	
	Jill clicks off. She dumps something else from the envelope
	into her hand... A BLUE PLASTIC CARD, the size of a Visa,
	blank except for a mag-stripe. There's a small hole in one
	corner, through which a chain is strung. Jill slings the
	chain over head, wearing the blue card like a pendant.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	CHRIS is still asleep. JILL comes out of the bathroom and
	looks down at him longingly.  Should she wake him?  Tell him
	what's happening?  She wants to, but duty prevents it.  She
	pulls herself away.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   CLOSET   MORNING
	
	TCHIK TCHIK TCHIK...JILL pushes aside hangers which hold her
	clothes. She types numbers into a hidden KEYPAD. A SECRET
	PANEL OPENS, revealing a CLOSET WITHIN THE CLOSET, packed
	with COMBAT UNIFORMS and WEAPONS.
	
	INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	The sound... TCHUNG... of the front door closing snaps CHRIS
	awake.  His first thought is for his lover.  He reaches out
	and finds that... she's not in bed.  He jumps up, rushes to
	a window, looks down, from the second story, and sees...
	
	
	Pg-9
	
	EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
	
	...JILL, heavily ARMED, in UNIFORM, wearing a beret that has
	an insignia... S.T.A.R.S. She rushes down the front path and
	jumps into A HUMMER with THREE OTHER TROOPERS on board. The
	vehicle pulls instantly away...
	
	...leaving Chris, looking through the window, puzzled, angry,
	and very much wounded.
	
	
	INT/EXT   HUMMER   MORNING
	
	RUSSO drives. WILLIAMS and DISIMONE sit in the back, all
	tough Special-Forces types. JILL, in the front passenger
	seat, though the only female, ranks the highest.
	
				DISIMONE
			Another practice run, right?
	
				RUSSO
			We been practicin' six months!
			For what?
	
				JILL
			For this. This is the real deal.
	
				WILLIAMS
			Honest to God?
	
				JILL
			Based on my experience, Williams,
			God isn't always honest
	
				DISIMONE
			Where we goin'?
	
				JILL
			In there.
	
	Jill points into THE ARKLEY FOREST which lies ahead. Miles
	of old growth-trees shrouded in a ghostly morning mist.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	EXT   THE FOREST   MORNING
	
	DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE MIST... THE HUMMER bounces over
	non-roads and stops fifty yards from...
	
	...A PAIR OF IRON GATES, each wrought with the letter "A".
	Beyond, the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of...
	A MANSION.  Huge.  Like Xandau.  THE TROOPERS, amazed,
	climb out and approach the gates.
	
	Pg-10
	
				RUSSO
			If you had the jing to build a place
			like this, would you build it in the
			middle of fuckin' nowhere?
	
				WILLIAMS
			Paris.
	
				DISIMONE
			Manhattan. Upper west.
	
				JILL
			(Wistfully) Some people prefer...
			a quiet life. (Back to business)
			Our orders are to secure the area.
	
				DISIMONE
			From what? This area's been 'secure'
			since the French and Indian War!
	
	A deep, animal SNARL comes from the woods.  The troopers
	raise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush.  The
	fog keeps sunlight from penetrating.  The forest is a maze
	of dark shadows. Leaves flutter.  Limbs SNAP.  Then...
	
	DARK SHAPES can be seen moving, circling.  A half-dozen
	of them.  Maybe more.  Jill whips out a transmitter and
	quickly types an access code.
	
				JILL
			(Into radio) This is Valentine,
			Bravo Team. We, er... we might be
			in trouble, here.
	
	KRITCH! Something LEAPS out of the brush. Automatic
	WEAPONS SPIT reflexively.
	
	KRITCH KRITCH KRITCH...more lunging SHAES appear. The
	troopers scatter, firing, as they are attacked from all
	sides. Jill dives for the shrubbery, shouting into her
	transmitter.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			WE ARE IN TROUBLE!
	
	CUT TO :
	
	INT   HUEY   MORNING
	
	JILL'S VOICE stutters over a headset which is pressed against
	A MAN'S EAR.
	
				JILL (o.s. filter)
			Under attack... by.. .assailants...
			Unidentifi...
	
	Pg-11
	
	Static. Hissing air. The SHOT WIDENS as the man lowers his
	headset. First we see the TATTOO on his arm... a grinning
	SKULL which we recognize. Then, gradually, we see his face.
	Lean and mean, wearing dark sunglasses, this is ALBERT
	WESKER, a hard-assed career officer.
	
				WESKER
			Can you get a trace?
	
	The pilot, LAGUARDIA, responds.
	
				LAGUARDIA
			Lost the beacon. It just cut out.
			Like it was...swallowed by something.
	
	Oddly, Wesker smiles.
	
				WESKER
			I do believe, gentlemen...that we're
			gonna be earning some combat pay.
	
	There are three other MEN on board. The closest to Wesker
	is BARRY BURTON, a muscular black man, as big as a grizzly,
	with the heart of a Teddy.
	
				BARRY
			Damn, if you don't love a fight.
	
				WESKER
			Hey, if I didn't... you'd be a dead
			man. (To the pilot) Call in a nine-
			nine. I want Raccoon City e-vacked.
	
	Wesker and the men fly from the lens.  THE CAMERA passes
	Out through one of the helicopter's windows as the chopper soars
	away.  When the SHOT WIDENS, we see OTHER HUEYS...black,
	unmarked, keeping formation.  Three... six...ten of them.
	
	EXT   FOREST   MORNING
	
	GUNS BLAZE. THE TROOPERS are under assault by thrashing,
	inhuman SHAPES...GROWLING, SNAPPING. JILL rolls into a
	natural trench.  DISIMONE is behind her, WILLIAMS is
	crawling just ahead, his legs pumping.  Jill scoots past
	him and sees that...
	
	...those legs aren't moving on their own.  They've been
	RIPPED AWAY FROM WILLIAMS' TORSO and are being dragged into
	the underbrush by some... BEAST... concealed in the thick
	brush, so we never get a clear look at it.
	
	OTHER BEASTS attack DiSimone.  Then Russo.  We see only
	details.  Jill fires her pistol, point blank... to no avail.
	RED-RIMMED EYES, SNARLING JAWS, DROOLING TEETH descend on
	her as we CUT TO:
	
	
	Pg-12
	
	EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT BUILDING   MORNING
	
	CHRIS steps out of Jill's building. Suddenly, incongruously,
	camo-painted HUEYS swoop down out of the sky.
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   MAIN STREET   MORNING
	
	THE CHOPPERS land where they can. COMMANDOS leap out and
	begin to cordon off the town.  Bullhorns blare.
	
	BULLHORN
	There's been an accident in the
	hills nearby. A military aircraft,
	carrying live weapons, has crashed...
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   SIDE STREET   MORNING
	
	CHRIS runs down a side-street into AN ALLEY, where he's
	trapped by COMMANDOS, both in front and behind.
	
				SOLDIER
			Let's go, hayseed. (Aiming his M-16)
			You gonna be a good boy?
	
	Chris swallows his fury. Gritting his teeth, he goes along
	with the soldiers, prodded, by rifle barrels, out onto...
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY  MAIN STREET   MORNING
	
	...Main Street, where there is CHAOS... an Orwellian sight,
	as CITIZENS find themselves horded into helicopters and
	TRUCKS from the local National Guard Post.
	
	A sweating man, still in his pajamas, rushes up to the
	SOLDIERS that are escorting CHRIS.
	
				MAN
			Look here, I'm the Sheriff of this...
	
				SOLDIER
			Step aside.
	
				SHERIFF
			But, I'm the Sheriff! An ex-Army man, like you.
	
				BULLHORN (o.s.)
			There is no immediate danger, but
			as a precaution, we are evacuating
			the area. You will be provided
			shelter until the weapons have been
			removed from the crash site.
	
	Pg-13
	
				SHERRIFF
			That's a worn-out scenario. If
			a plane crashed nearby, don't you
			think somebody would have heard
			it go down? Tell us the truth,
			guys. What's this really about?
	
				SOLDIER
			I said, STEP ASIDE!
	
	The soldier lifts his rifle. He's about to CLUB the sheriff
	when Chris lunges, grabbing his arm. WHOOMPH! Chris kicks
	the soldier in the balls. The man buckles. Chris bolts.
	
	One of the other commandos FIRES at him, a loud BURST which
	misses Chris but SHATTERS a shop window, setting off wild
	PANIC on the street. Chris ducks into a building...
	
	EXT   RACCOON CITY   BACK STREET   MORNING
	
	...and out a rear door. He runs through a warren of back
	alleyways, arriving at...
	
	...A JEEP SAHARA which is parked behind Jill's apartment
	building. He jumps in without opening the door, jams the key
	into the ignition, and ROARS off.
	
	INT   HUEY   MORNING
	
	Still airborne, in one of the black helicopters that have yet
	to reach the site, WESKER barks orders into a radio.
	
				WESKER
			Charlie, David, Edward, proceed to
			Raccoon City. Assist the e-vack.
			I'm going on target with Alpha Team.
			All forces stand ready to support.
	
	EXT   FARM   MORNING
	
	CHRIS rumbles his jeep onto a picturesque FARM, secluded deep
	in the forest. We don't recognize it immediately. It was
	dark when we last saw the place.
	
	Jumping out, Chris sees three large SHAPES lying in the grass
	of a corral. Rushing over, Chris realizes...
	
	...they're HORSES. One of them is LUCKY, his prize
	stallion... DEAD, in a pool of BLOOD, with its belly torn
	open and a huge chunk out of its neck.
	
				CHRIS
			Aw, no... (Devastated) ...L-Lucky.
	
	
	Pg-14
	
	Chris hears a weak, MOANING SOUND. He turns and sees...
	RAKE, lying near a water pump. Chris rushes to the man's
	side and finds him brutally SLASHED, barely clinging to life.
	
				RAKE
			(Coughing blood) They... they come
			outta the trees, Reddy. Don't... don't
			know what they was. Figure... maybe
			some kinda... wolves, or somethin' ...
	
	Examining the man's wounds, Chris realizes they're fatal.
	
				RAKE
			I... I never seen 'em comin'.
	
				CHRIS
			Don't try to talk, Rake.
	
				RAKE (cont.)
			I... ain't... never left this farm...
			untended... since yer daddy first
			took it over.
	
				CHRIS
			I know. You... kept the place runnin'...
			better than me.
	
				RAKE
			I just...never seen 'em comin', Reddy.
			Never even...had a chance to...turn
			a gun on 'em.
	
	There's a THUNDER in the sky. Chris looks up. Wesker's
	Fleet of black HUEYS appears on the horizon.  They split up,
	Seven banking off toward Raccoon City, the remaining three
	grinding ahead over the forest, slowing down, dropping in
	altitude.
	
				CHRIS
			Where are they going? There's
			nothing in there... except...
	
				RAKE
			Y'oughta... remember it... real good.
			I do.  From... when you was a kid.
	
				CHRIS
			The... the old Arkley place?
	
				RAKE
			I remember them days. I surely do...
			Remember them... them old days.
	
	Chris looks back down at the old man, who is drifting,
	starting to lose it.
	
	Pg-15
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			I'm not gonna bullshit you, Rake.
			You're...in a bad time. If there's
			any way to save you, I'll find it,
			I swear. You just... hang in there,
			old guy. I'll be right back.
	
	Chris jumps to his feet and runs into...
	
	INT   FARMHOUSE   MORNING
	
	...the great-room of the FARMHOUSE. Rustic. Cozy. CHRIS
	snatches up a telephone. There's no dial-tone. The line
	is dead. Chris rushes to a gun cabinet and pulls out an old
	WINCHESTER rifle. He scoops ammo from a drawer into a
	shoulder bag and runs back outside...
	
	EXT   FARM   MORNING
	
	...where his eyes catch MOVEMENT in the corral. LUCKY,
	entrails spilling, is trying to stand.
	
				CHRIS
			Oh, God, Rake. Oh, Jesus, the poor thing's still alive.
	
	Chris shoulders his ammo bag, reaches inside, and quickly
	reloads the Winchester. Stepping forward, he aims carefully.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Sorry, old hoss.
	
	
	BLAM!  A clean shot to the horse's brain drops the animal.
	
	It takes Chris a long moment to recover... then, he looks into
	the trees. The helicopters are no longer in sight, but their
	THUNDER remains.  They haven't landed yet.
	
	Chris turns and rushes back to Rake's side, only to find...
	...he has died. Chris' jaws tighten, but he has no time
	to mourn. He closes Rake's eyes. Digs through the grass.
	Pulls up a handful of dirt. Stuffs it into the old man's
	hand, and closes his stiffening fingers over it.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			The earth keeps us.
	
	Conquering his emotions, Chris runs to his jeep and jumps in.
	He shifts into four-wheel-drive and, ignoring the road, heads
	straight over the field for the trees.
	
	As the jeep disappears, THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN, ZOOMING
	IN ON...
	
	Pg-16
	
	...one of the farm dogs. The SPANIEL. Not the entire
	animal, but one of its three SEPARATE PARTS... it's front
	end... CRUSHED head, BLOODY neck, and a single BROKEN paw...
	
	...which is trying to CRAWL.
	
	Fifty yards away, RAKE'S HAND relaxes. The earth spills out
	through his fingers as the dead man's eyes... POP OPEN.
	
	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MORNING
	
	THE FIRST OF THE BLACK HUEYS drops, hazardously, into a
	small clearing with barely enough space. Unable to land
	on the scrub-brush, it hovers ten feet off the ground. Its
	rotors CLIP TREE LEAVES as WESKER, BARRY, and TWO OTHER
	S.T.A.R.S. COMMANDOS jump out, heavily armed. The chopper
	lifts off, placed by HUEY NUMBER TWO.
	
	NOT FAR AWAY, CHRIS navigates through undergrowth until he
	can see THE HELICOPTERS through the trees. The THUNDER from
	their rotors masks the grinding of Chris' jeep. He pulls
	within a hundred yards and, leaving his vehicle in the bush,
	moves closer, cautiously, on foot.
	
	THE THIRD HUEY air-drops TWO MEN and TWO WOMEN in S.T.A.R.S.
	uniforms. There are TWELVE COMMANDOS in all... ALPHA TEAM.
	Wesker looks up at the Huey's PILOT, using his radio to speak
	to the man.
	
				WESKER
			You'll have to rotate or you'll run
			out of fuel, but I want one chopper
			to remain in the air at all times.
			We might need help in a hurry.
	
	A "Roger that", squaks back as the Huey banks away.
	
	Barry looks worried. His instincts are asking... "We might
	need... 'help'".  Against what? We only see this in his eyes,
	he says nothing as...
	
	...Wesker leads the team through the woods, unaware of...
	
	...CHRIS, following behind, crouching around trees and
	bushes, not a trained commando, but comfortable with the
	land, a natural warrior using ancestral instincts.
	
	THE CAMERA TRACKS COMBAT BOOTS as they CRUNCH through the
	low-Lying MIST.. .stopping abruptly when they encounter...
	
	...WEAPONS, AMMO BELTS, bits of SHRDDED UNIFORMS... and
	HUMAN BODY PARTS... strewn all through the surrounding brush,
	remnants of what was obviously a feeding-frenzy.
	
	
	Pg-17
	
				VICKERS
			Holy... Goh... gaah...
	
	BRAD VICKERS vomits. Unarmed, he's Alpha Team's computer-
	techie. Not a combat soldier, he's a bit of a coward.
	
	Another non-combatant, REBECCA CHAMBERS, is the team's
	medical officer. She digs an ammonia capsule from her
	pack and holds it under Vickers' nose.
	
	RICHARD AIKEN and KENNETH SULLIVAN are buddies, regular
	G.I. Joes, right out of every war movie. Aiken stares at
	the carnage, calmly chewing a wad of gum.
	
				AIKEN
			You ever eat road-kill, Sullivan?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken... a guy with a brain your
			size would be better off dead.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (o.s.)
			Want me to shoot ya, Aiken?
	
	ROSIE RODRIGUEZ, a tough, body-built babe steps in.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			I'm ready ta shoot somebody.
	
				ALKEN
			I'll pass. Shoot Sullivan.
	
	FOREST SPEYER, a wiry Willem Defoe type, finds a bloody BERET
	and brings it to Wesker.  There's an I.D. tag on the brim...
	
				WESKER
			(Reading the tag) 'Valentine'. (Beat)
			Radio Washington.  Bravo Team found
			on site. No survivors.
	
	In the bushes, Chris overhears, not wanting to believe. He
	sees Wesker angrily pitch Jill's beret into the brush.
	
				WESKER
			We're goin' in.  Watch your backs.
	
	Wesker advances his troops. When the coast is clear, Chris
	rushes in, picks up the beret, and sees the name tag for
	himself. "Valentine ".
	
	After what happened at the farm... now this... feeling sucker-
	punched, defeated, Chris hangs his head.
	
	One of the HUEYS dips in low.
	
	
	Pg-18
	
	Chris looks up. The sight of the war machine lifts him from
	defeat... to rage.  His eyes are soft, for the last time, as
	he tucks Jill's beret into his pack.  When he looks up again,
	those eyes have become newly predatory.  He ducks out of
	sight as the helicopter swings lower.
	
	Downdraft from the rotors makes the bushes rustle, catching
	Chris' attention.  He realizes that... it's not just the wind.
	The shrubs are being disturbed by...
	
	SOMETHING DARK which is moving through them.  It pokes
	its head out.  A WOLF! Rake was right.  Chris readies his
	Winchester as the animal stalks forward.
	
	It's not a wolf. It's A DOG. Mottled, its flesh gray,
	covered with rotting lesions... and it has three bleeding
	BULLET HOLES in its belly, chest, neck.
	
	GROWRRR!  It LEAPS at Chris... who fires... BLAM!
	
	Up ahead, Wesker and his commandos freeze.
	
				WESKER
			Who fired? WHO FIRED?
	
	Before anyone can answer, the team is ATTACKED by MORE DOGS
	which BURST out of the surrounding woods...DOBERMANS and
	SHEPHERDS... but something is seriously wrong with all of
	them. Their EYES are DEAD, their FLESH decaying.
	
	Automatics piss streams of lead. Hot rounds TEAR through the
	animals, many of the slugs accidentally blowing out brains.
	of his bullets hits its target... one of the dogs' heads.
	
	The commandos are backed up against... the IRON GATES we
	saw earlier. The Arkley Mansion stands beyond.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Let's get inside.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			NO! (Shouting) I WANT 'EM ALL
			DEAD! YOU HEAR ME? STAND FAST...
			UNTIL THEY ARE ALL DEAD !
	
	The dogs don't stand a chance. Alpha Team's firepower is
	overwhelming. But there is a human casualty. JOSEPH FROST
	trips and falls. One of the dogs POUNCES on him, chewing
	out his HEART... through his BACK.
	
	Wesker steps in, RIDDLING the dead man, and the dog, with
	forty rounds from his M-16.
	
	Pg-19
	
	In the next instant, ANOTHER DOG LEAPS at Wesker from behind.
	He hears its snarl... too late.  He dives into the grass...
	too late.  The dog is about to land on him when...
	...it's BLASTED out of mid air by... Barry.
	
				BARRY
			Even-Steven, boss.  You saved my
			ass in the desert.  I saved yours I
			in Pennsylvania.
	
	Wesker stand, straightening his ever-present sunglasses.
	
				WESKER
			I don't believe in being... 'Even-
			Steven' with anybody.  A man saves
			my ass...I pay him back.  Before
			this day is over, I'll pay you back,
			Barry.  Just... stick with me, okay?
	
	Wesker checks his equipment belt. Something is missing.
	He looks to where he rolled in the grass. Using a FLASH-
	LIGHT, he finds...
	
	...a small electronic unit the size of a cell-phone. But
	it's not a cell-phone. Whatever it is... Wesker clips it
	onto his belt.
	
	FROM THE BRUSH, Chris sees all this. The guns have gone
	silent. The attack seems to be over. Chris moves stealthily
	to the body of the animal that he shot. It's wearing a
	COLLAR which reads...
	
				  SPIKE #26
	
	Alongside the I.D., there's a corporate-looking logo... the
	symbol of an UMBRELLA.
	
	GRRROWWWLL! ANOTHER DOG is advancing on Chris. He aims
	his Winchester.  CLICK! The magazine is empty.  No time to
	reload.  The dog is on him.  Chris SCRAMBLES away.  The dog
	BOUNDS after him.
	
	Chris drops to the ground.  Did he trip?  No.  He pushes a
	TREE ROOT, which is FALSE.  It swings open and he dives in,
	pulling the root shut over him.
	
	The dog arrives an instant later.  It lets out an angry
	howl... and is BLOWN AWAY... by RODRIGUEZ, who neither saw
	Chris, nor where he went.
	
	The forest goes dead quiet.  Too quiet.  There's not even
	the chirping of morning birds Wesker is SLAPPED startlingly
	on the back... by Barry.
	
	Pg-20
	
				BARRY
			Look here, man.  I'd follow you
			into any kind of enemy fire.  But
			these things ain't firin' at us.
			They want us for breakfast!  When
			are you gonna tell us what the
			hell is goin' on here?
	
				WESKER
			When you need to know.  Just do
			your job, soldier.  That's what
			I'm doin'.  My job.
	
	Wesker pulls a chain from under his shirt. It holds a card,
	the size of a Visa, like the one Jill found in her secret
	envelope, only Wesker's isn't blue, it's green.
	
	Stepping away from Barry, he slide the card through a slot
	in the iron gate-frame.  BUZZZZ.  The GATES SWING OPEN with
	a rusty SQUEAL.
	
	INT   TUNNEL   MORNING
	
	CHRIS crawls through a long, dark shaft with earthen walls,
	a man-made tunnel.
	
	EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MANSION   MORNING
	
	AT THE MANSION'S FRONT DOOR, a hand-carved monolith of solid
	oak, WESKER finds another hidden SLOT and swipes his card.
	The giant door CREAKS OPEN.
	
	INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING
	
	INSIDE, the place looks like a HAUNTED HOUSE, a glorious
	ruin, once spectacular, now mysterious and threatening.
	The chandeliers and furniture are covered with sheets that
	ripple on breezes from a thousand faults in the old walls.
	Indistinct NOISES echo within the ceiling, the floor, as
	ALPHA TEAM enters.
	
				AIKEN
			Old. They probably don't have cable.
	
				SULLIVAN
			They probably don't have radio.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Who's they? Who's place is this?
	
	WESKER shuts the front door. The BOOMING SOUND makes us
	wonder if we will ever see it opened again.
	
	
	Pg-21
	
				WESKER
			Guy named Arkley.  Bootlegger.  Built
			this old fortress during prohibition.
			He figured nobody'd ever find him out
			here in the back woods.  Nobody did.
			Till he died.  Feds have had it ever
			since.  Place has been here for eighty
			years... derelict... a safe-house.
	
				BARRY
			A safe-house... for who? For what?
	
				WESKER
			There's a... a secret installation.
			Below.  A network of laboratories.
	
				REBECCA
			What kind of... laboratories?
	
				WESKER
			(Shrugging) They didn't issue us
			gas-masks, so I figure... it's okay
			to breathe.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Why send in a strike-force?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Yeah. What are we supposed to do?
			Polish the silver?
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			There's a man downstairs. A top-
			priority man.  It's our job to...
			bring him out.  Hopefully, there
			are others alive, as well. We'll
			Rescue them, too... if we can...but
			Dr. John Marcus... he comes out alive
			at any and all cost.
	
	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   MORNING
	
	Though it's still morning, the windows are sealed over.  No
	sunshine can enter. From this point on... there will be no
	indication of time... except as shown on clocks.  A sense of
	dread takes hold of us as...
	
	...dark SHADOWS LURCH...FEET SCRAPE sluggishly... not in
	combat boots, but in Nikes, loafers, Dr. Martens... past an
	accordion GATE of corroded bronze.  A motor HUMS.  Behind
	the gate, an old-fashioned service ELEVATOR rises... but stops
	just below floor level. EYES peer out, waiting for the
	shuffling feet to pass.  Then the car rises the rest of
	the way, revealing its occupant...
	
	Pg-22
	
	...JILL VALENTINE! She's alive! She deactivates the
	elevator by pulling her blue ACCESS CARD out of an incon-
	gruously modern receptacle. Checking to be sure that the
	coast is clear, she slides the accordion gate aside and
	steps out into the corridor.
	
	With a ghostly MOAN, something LUNGES at her out of the
	shadows. It's A MAN in a lab coat. His skin is ROTTING,
	his teeth SNAPPING, like the dogs'. He tries to BITE Jill,
	not merely to do injury. He seems HUNGRY!
	
	Jill leaps aside, lifting her pistol and FIRING... once,
	twice, three times. The man is shot in the stomach, heart,
	neck...but he keeps coming! Finally, Jill shoots him in the
	head...and he falls.
	
	Jill quickly reloads, on instinct. But as she does it, she
	stares at the corpse, frowning, weighing life-long belief
	against the hideous facts of the moment.
	
	INT   MANSION   CENTRAL HALL   MORNING
	
	WESKER and his troopers hear the GUNSHOTS. There are THREE
	DOORS nearby. Wesker selects one that seems to lead to the
	source of the gunshots. Using his card, he unlocks it.
	
				WESKER
			Three men stay here. Chambers...
	
				REBECCA
			I'm not a man.
	
				WESKER
			Rodriguez...
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			I'm better than a man.
	
	Wesker grins, but hardly skips a beat.
	
				WESKER
			Alright. you come with us. Aiken,
			Sullivan, stick here with Chambers.
	
	The troop moves out. Aiken and Sullivan remain in the
	central hall with Rebecca.
	
				AIKEN
			Why us?
	
				SULLIVAN
			I dunno why me. You? I guess the
			C.O. figures you're as worthless
			as a dame, Aiken.
	
	Pg-23
	
	Sullivan catches Rebecca's eye.
	
				SULLIVAN (cont.)
			Er... sorry, ma' am. I... I didn't  ...
			I meant Aiken... Not you.
	
				REBECCA
			Relax. I get it.
	
	INT   MANSION LIBRARY   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER leads his TROOP into an enormous, cobwebbed library
	lined with book shelves, but no books. There are doorways
	on all four walls. Wesker pulls out something that looks
	like a Game-Boy. He types on a keypad. A MAP of the mansion
	appears. Wesker scrolls with the arrow-keys. Barry looks
	on very impressed with the high-tech unit.
	
				BARRY
			That thing...tells you where to go?
	
	Wesker doesn't answer. He pockets the "Game Boy".
	
				WESKER
			One man stays here. Ridley. You're
			it. Shoot to kill. Just make sure
			it's not one of us. The rest of you...
			this way.
	
	Wesker, leads his squad through one of the doorways. RIDLEY,
	a young rookie, remains.
	
	INT   UNDERGROUND CAVERN   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS reaches the end of the earthen tunnel. There are
	signs that children once played here... TOY SOLDIERS.
	GRAFFITI.  Chris finds his nickname... Christopher Reddy...
	etched in hardened mud.  After a moment of reflection,
	he moves on, into...
	
	
	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS
	
	...a small, sheet-rock chamber.  CHRIS rushes to a DOOR
	that looks like it's been there since the beginning of time.
	As soon as he touches the knob... AN ALARM SOUNDS!
	
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	RIDLEY, standing guard, hears THE ALARM. He hears Chris
	JIGGLING the knob. But he sees NO DOOR. The walls around
	him seem to be solid slabs.
	
	
	Pg-24
	
	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS can't get the doorknob to turn. Behind him, a dusty
	ORIENTAL CARPET BULGES upward. One corner flops aside.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	RIDLEY is spooked by the sound. Frightened, trembling,
	he un-slings his rifle.
	
				RIDLEY
			Who... who's there?
	
	INT   ENTRY CHAMBER   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS doesn't hear the trooper. Behind him, A Decomposed
	HAND pokes out of a drainage ditch beneath the carpet. It
	gropes. Finds purchase on the floor.
	
	Chris is unaware of the danger. He HURLS himself against
	the door. He can't break through.
	
	The thing that climbs out of the ditch was once a man, once
	a SCIENTIST. It's wearing a lab coat and a pair of thick
	EYEGLASSES. But it's long dead. It's... A ZOMBIE.
	
	As it pulls itself up, its eyeglasses strike the side of the
	ditch. They fall, CLATTERING, the rims scraping the zombie's
	cheek, which peels away like onion skin.
	
	Chris hears the noise. Turns and sees...
	
	...the dead man, reaching out hungrily.  Chris is trapped.
	He aims his Winchester. CLICK! He forgot. It's empty.
	
	The zombie pulls itself fully up onto the floor. Chris digs
	in his shoulder bag. Pulls out a handful of bullets and with
	them, accidentally, Jill's BERET. Rising emotion stops him
	for a moment.
	
	The dead man crawls toward him. Chris might not have time
	to load. As he tries to jam a bullet into his rifle, the
	zombie SWATS at him.  Catches the beret.  Looks at it.
	Sniffs it.  The bullet pops out of Chris' nervous fingers.
	He tries to load another.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	RIDLEY spots A BLUE ACCESS SLOT in the wall. He levels his
	automatic and CHEWS the thing up with a short burst.
	
	A PANEL SWINGS OPEN! CHRIS dives out... with the ZOMBIE
	inches behind him. Ridley FIRES off another BURST OF ROUNDS.
	
	
	Pg-25
	
	Stray bullets PIERCE the zombie's head. It drops back into
	the chamber...with Ridley never knowing why.
	
	Ridley and Chris look at each other, asking rapid-fire
	questions, none of them answered.
	
				RIDLEY
			Who are you?
	
				CHRIS
			Who are YOU? What the hell is 
			S.T.A.R.S.?
	
				RIDLEY
			How'd you get in here?
	
				CHRIS
			Who sealed the door?
	
				RIDLEY
			Who knew there a door?
	
	WHAM! ANOTHER ZOMBIE appears suddenly behind Ridley, BITING
	out the muscle between his shoulder and neck. The trooper
	stands, stunned, for a moment...
	
				RIDLEY
			Who... who... ?
	
	...then he drops..
	
	The zombie, in a uniform, once a security guard, gazes dully
	at Chris.  A wet sound comes from inside its gullet as it
	calmly chews on Ridley's flesh.  Swallowing, it reaches out.
	Chris grabs its arms, FLINGS it into the chamber. Then
	FIRES his Winchester, once, putting a HOLE in the thing's
	head. Chris slams the door.
	
	
	INT   MANSION   DINING ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	In a Hearst-sized dining room with draped furniture, WESKER
	and the OTHER TROOPERS have heard the new gunfire.
	
				SPEYER
			Where'd that come from?
	
				BARRY
			Back...where we just were.
	
				SPEYER
			Shit, man, we're chasin' our tails!
	
	
	
	Pg-26
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS hears the CLATTERING of the troopers heading his way.
	What he doesn't hear is... a slight CRACKLING... in the walls.
	
	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER and his TEAM burst into the corridor with the old-
	fashioned ELEVATOR.  FLASHLIGHTS find... the body of the
	ZOMBIE that was shot by Jill, bullet HOLES allover its body.
	
				SPEYER
			Damn. Surnbitch took a lotta lead.
	
				BARRY
			That's not what killed him. Blood's
			still running. Wounds are fresh.
			But look at his skin. This guy's
			been dead for a couple of days.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			He was dead... before he was shot?
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS checks Ridley.  No pulse.  His own rustling movements
	prevent him from hearing... that soft CRACKLING SOUND.
	
	The kitchen is lined with fifty-year-old IVY-PATTERNED
	WALLPAPER.  The printed VINES seem to be MOVING!  Chris
	doesn't notice until the vines begin to WIGGLE furiously...
	and RIP THROUGH the paper.  They're REAL.  Sprouts from
	some sort of exotic plant, that have climbed up the walls...
	with INTELLIGENCE!  They seem aware of Chris' presence.
	
				REBECCA (O.S.)
			Ridley?
	
	REBECCA has appeared in an open doorway. Chris looks at her,
	with the tips of the vines beginning to brush his shoulders.
	
				REBECCA (cont.)
			Who... who are...
	
				CHRIS
			I... I'm one of the good guys, okay
			I'm just trying to...
	
				REBECCA
			(Calling) SULLIVAN! AIKEN!
	
				CHRIS
			Shit.
	
	
	Pg-27
	
	Chris, familiar with the room, opens a SMALL DOOR in the
	wall, barely man-sized, and almost invisible because it's
	covered in matching wallpaper. Chris dives in.
	
	AIKEN and SULLIVAN pop up behind Rebecca, having barely
	caught a glimpse of Chris.
	
				AIKEN
			Who was that?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Forget him. What are they?
	
	Sullivan points at the vines... which are swirling, groping,
	as if alive, making their way toward Ridley's body.
	
	INT  MANSION   CHUTE   TIMELESS
	
	In a LAUNDRY CHUTE, propping himself against the sides,
	CHRIS descends...down...down... as he did as a child...
	and comes out onto...
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   TIMELESS
	
	...a DROP-CEILING, newly installed. Iron frames support
	AIR-FILTRATION SYSTEMS and other heavy MACHINERY. Sheet-
	metal walls have replaced the old soffit and fascia. LIGHT,
	from somewhere below, knifes through gridded iron vents.
	
				CHRIS
			Somebody did some major remodeling.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	The VINES continue to advance.
	
				REBECCA
			We gotta get him out!
	
	THE TROOPERS rush to retrieve RIDLEY'S BODY. The VINES hover
	around them, occasionally DARTING, then pulling back, as if
	they were timid animals, hungry, but afraid of anew food-
	dish. When AIKEN brandishing his M-16, the VINES RECOIL and
	RETRACT fully... THWIP THWIP THWIP... behind the wallpaper and
	down... somewhere into the bowels of the house.
	
				AIKEN
			What? Smart fuckin' plants?
	
				SULLIVAN
			No big deal. Most-plants are
			smarter than you, Aiken.
	
	
	Pg-28
	
	INT   MANSION   CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	THE OTHERS are still puzzling over the DOWNED ZOMBIE.
	
				SPEYER
			Why would anyone shoot a dead man?
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Lemme guess. Maybe 'cause he was...
			walkin' around?
	
	Barry steps closer to the corpse, notes its collapsed skull.
	
				BARRY
			Head-shot. We were sprayin' those
			dogs outside... but think about it.
			Were any of 'em brought down without
			a head-shot.
	
	Wesker has been exploring the corridor. Stopping in front
	of the elevator, he shines his light into the car. We expect
	someone... or some-thing... to be lurking inside.
	
	An attack comes from the opposite direction. A FIGURE BURSTS-
	out of the shadows behind Weasker. Another Zombie?  No.  It's
	JILL! In a rage, she holds her pistol to Wesker's head.
	
				JILL
			I lost three me.  You killed them,
			Wesker. You did... and I did. Because
			I didn't know what to expect... because
			you... didn't tell me!
	
				WESKER
			(Calmly) Tell you what?
	
				JILL
			Anything! I wasn't told anything!
	
				WESKER
			Put down the gun.
	
	Instead, Jill CLICKS the hammer back.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Put down the gun.
	
				JILL
			Not until...
	
				WESKER
			RELEASE! THAT'S AN ORDER, SOLDIER!
	
	Jill blinks. Slowly, reluctantly, she lowers her gun.
	
	Pg-29
	
	Wesker turns... and recognizes her.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			How... did you get in here?
	
				JILL
			(Sarcastic) How ya doin' , Valentine?
			Good to see ya. Glad you're still
			alive. Same here, colonel, I'm...
	
				WESKER
			How did you get in here?
	
				JILL
			(Exploding) The same way those fuckin'
			dogs got out! Through their pens!
			(Relaxing some) I... locked them off.
	
				WESKER
			Good thinking.
	
	A VOICE interrupts, from the end of the corridor.
	
				VOICE (o.s.)
			MAN DOWN!
	
	The voice is SULLIVAN'S. The troopers run to join him.
	Last to leave the corridor are Wesker and Jill. Wesker
	gestures gallantly.
	
				WESKER
			Ladies first.
	
				JILL
			Fuck you.
	
	INT   MANSION   KITCHEN   TIMELESS
	
	The TROOPERS trickle into the kitchen to find... REBECCA,
	kneeling over RIDLEY'S CORPSE, examining the ragged bite
	on its neck.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Maybe... they're in the house.
			More of them dogs.
	
				REBECCA
			Diameter's too small. It... almost
			looks as if... it was done by a...
	
				JILL
			(Arriving) A human?
	
	Rebecca looks up. The two women make sisterly eye-contact.
	
	
	Pg-30
				REBECCA
			Yes, but... what kind of... human...
			would do something like this?
	
				AIKEN
			Not a vegetarian, that's for sure.
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken, you'd be better off...
	
				REBECCA
			There was a guy. Not part of the
			team. And there was... some kind
			of... plant... that seemed... alive.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Gimme a fuckin' break.
	
				AIKEN
			No shit. It disappeared... right
			into the wall.
	
	Rodriguez cringes when she finds a ragged hole in the wall-
	paper near where she's standing.
	
				WESKER
			I guess it's... time to spill it.
	
	WESKER pulls off his dark glasses for the first time.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			I don't know... much more than I
			already told you.  I'll tell you
			the rest now.  The labs hare are...
			were...working on special apps for
			bio-eng1neered materials.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Speak English, hombre.
	
				WESKER
			Marcus has been experimenting with
			an artificial... man-made... virus.
			Coded...the 'T'-virus.  Financing
			came from a private corporation, you
			may have heard the name... Umbrella.
	
				JILL
			They're... multi-national. Huge.
	
				WESKER
			So huge that they have... connections...
			in high places.  That's why we're here.
	
	
	Pg-31
	
				BARRY
			This virus... it jumped, right?
	
				SPEYER
			Shit! We're all dead! We got the
			bug, and we're all dead!
	
				WESKER
			It's not airborne. It was spread...
			in the water supply. Lab animals
			and... the researchers themselves...
			passed it on... by...
	
				JILL
			By... biting.
	
	Wesker hangs his head. It's an affirmation.
	
				BARRY
			You catch this virus and... what?
	
				WESKER
			You die. But... not for long. The
			chemical...revives the brain, and...
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			You stand back up... and chew on
			the first guy you see.
	
				SPEYER
			Christ, this is like... Night of the
			Living Dead!
	
				BARRY
			Why, in the name of Jesus, would
			anybody wanna mess with shit...
			that does that shit?
	
				WESKER
			Victory, friend. Civilization has
			come a long way, but we still have...
			war.  Imagine... a soldier who can't
			die.  That... was the concept.
	
				JILL
			But the virus... jumped.
	
				WESKER
			Hopefully... if we got all the dogs...
			we've contained it.
	
				JILL
			Hopefully?  Jesus... why didn't you
			tell us?
	
	
	Pg-32
	
				WESKER
			By telling you NOW, I've put your
			lives in jeopardy. Nobody has this
			information. Except a few high-and-
			mightys. Me. And now, you.
	
	The troopers fall silent as all this sinks in.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			We have to get Marcus out of here.
			He developed this thing. He's the
			only one who... understands it.
	
				REBECCA
			I don't know, this all sounds pretty
			shaky to me...
	
	With a lightning move, Wesker draws his pistol and...BLAM!
	FIRES... at Rebecca. She flinches. The bullet flies past
	her and SHATTERS the skull of RIDLEY, the dead trooper who,
	having stood up, was about to attack Rebecca from behind.
	Ridley drops... dead again.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Guess that proves it. A head-shot
			knocks 'em down.
	
	Rebecca turns and looks at the blood-splattered body.
	
				REBECCA
			Th-that man.. .was dead. (Freaking)
			I... I'm a doctor! I should know!
			That man was dead!
	
	Vickers reaches in Rebecca's bag, pulls out an ammonia
	capsule, cracks it, and holds it under her nose.
	
				VICKERS
			I hope you have a lot of these.
	
	
	INT   CRAWL-SPACE   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS crawls across the drop-ceiling, into the up-rising
	light from one of the vents. He looks down through the
	grid work and sees...
	
	...the same LABORATORY that was behind Marcus in the opening
	video. No longer pristine, it's wrecked, torn apart. Files
	are scattered everywhere along with smashed fragments of
	furniture and computer hardware.
	
	CAGES that line the walls are filled with LAB ANIMALS making
	NERVOUS CHATTER. Chris watches a MONKEY sip water from a
	dish. Like the other animals, its skin is rotting.
	
	
	Pg-33
	
	Chris is about to move on, when his eye catches...
	
	...MOVEMENT... outside the cages.  There's A MAN, in a
	lab coat, sitting at a desk, writing on a note pad.
	
				CHRIS
			(Calling) Hey.
	
	CLOSE ON: the man's HAND... flaking, decomposing.  The pen
	it holds is making only random, erratic marks.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			HEY!
	
	The man turns his head, slowly, to look up toward the voice.
	There's NOTHING left of his FACE. RAW TISSUE seeps odd-
	colored fluids. A single eyeball is nested tenuously in
	the ooze. Something like a mouth, recognizable only because
	of its position, opens... and GROANS.
	
	Chris, pumping his Winchester, hears... KRANG! A NOISE from
	below. He looks down again, just as...
	
	...the lab door BURSTS open. WESKER and ALPHA TEAM stream
	into the lab. The thing with. the destroyed face turns toward
	the invaders, stands, and shuffles toward them.
	
	Without hesitation, Wesker, on point, FIRES a quick burst
	into the thing's brain. It drops like a sack. The lab
	animals SHRIEK.
	
	The team files in, not noticing... ANOTHER ZOMBIE... crawling
	across the floor...heading directly for SPEYER. Chris shouts
	
				CHRIS (cont. )
			HEADS UP!
	
	He punches out the grate with the barrels of his rifle
	and... BLAM!...punches a sure-fire HOLE in the zombie's head.
	
	BRAD VICKERS, his nerves badly frayed, thinks the team is
	being attacked. He SPRAYS the ceiling with his automatic.
	
	Chris ducks and rolls, narrowly escaping the initial barrage,
	but bullets keep coming, punching a dotted line up through
	the ceiling panels.
	
	Chris scrambles, as fast as he can, his feet barely escaping
	the punch holes.
	
	He finds himself on top of an enormous checkerboard of vents
	and Plexiglas panels. Bullets weaken the framework. It
	sags... then CRACKS, dropping away. Chris is plunged into...
	
	
	
	Pg-34
	
	INT   LAB   LEVEL "A" TIMELESS
	
	...WATER! CHRIS kicks, paddles with his rifle, righting
	himself, getting his bearings. He's in a huge AQUARIUM
	that's built into one of the laboratory's walls... and he's
	not alone. There are SIX SHARKS in the tank. ZOMBIE SHARKS,
	their flesh rotting, leaking pus.
	
	The largest of them SNAPS at Chris, but its jaws catch only
	a clump of his swirling hair. Chris kicks with his feet,
	remaining upright, and FIRES his wet Winchester.
	
	The bullet wimps-out, restrained by the water. It penetrates
	the shark, but barely. We can see the casing lodged in the
	animal's flesh.
	
	Chris gets an idea. He kicks forward. Plants the barrel
	of his Winchester directly against the aquarium glass...
	only to find himself aiming directly at...
	
	...JILL, who is aiming back at him with her M-16. They're
	both stunned. They stare at each other for a moment, like
	gunfighters, until...
	
	...another shark circles in for an attack. Chris swings the
	Winchester away from Jill and FIRES underwater. The aquarium
	glass CRACKS... but holds.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			Hang on! We're gonna get wet!
	
	Jill FIRES. More CRACKS, but the glass is resistant.
	Chris out. Water SURGES into the lab, knocking Wesker and
	some of his squad down.
	
	They stand up again, only to find themselves knee-high in a
	dark pool...with SHARK FINS slicing the surface. Everybody
	opens fire. The dead fish keep coming.
	
				AIKEN
			Where the fuck is a shark's brain?
	
				SULLIVAN
			In it's head! I swear, Aiken, you
			would be better off dead.
	
	In a bizarre frenzy, the sharks KICK their tails, making
	startlingly quick turns, darting every which way, SNAPPING
	at the scent of warm flesh. The troopers, hampered by the
	water, SPLASH around wildly, many of them nearly getting
	bitten. The air above thickens with a fog of graphite from
	ten spitting automatics.
	
	
	Pg-35
	
	The water gets darker as it becomes clouded with BLOOD. But
	thankfully, the level is dropping. The water is seeping out
	through GRATES in the floor. The sharks become more visible,
	moving slower as their bellies scrape the floor.
	
	The troopers pick them off, one by one. The immediate threat
	passes...but as the water drains away, the troopers become
	aware of... a KLAXON-LIKE SOUND. ANOTHER ALARM. The entry
	door glides shut with a BOOOMMM!
	
				WESKER
			Nice. Very NICE, Valentine! You
			set off a containment breach!
	
				JILL
			It must have been the water. God,
			the water! (She turns to Chris}
			Did you swallow any?
	
				SPEYER
			I did.
	
				SULLIVAN
			A bunch of us did, man.
	
				WESKER
			Separate systems. Salt water.
			No germs. But.. .it breached!
	
	Wesker, looking crazed, his sunglasses gone, is typing on
	his "Game-Boy"... getting no response.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			We can go in deeper.  But we can't
			get out.  Not with my card-key.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			So...we live here now.
	
	Rosie finds Sullivan looking at her curiously.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.}
			Landlords. Shit hills. Kicked my
			family out of six apartments. I
			got use to sayin'...'So...we live
			here now'.
	
				WESKER
			There are override exits... but I
			can't find them without THIS!
	
	Wesker FLINGS his "Game-Boy" angrily against a wall. It
	shatters into bits.
	
	
	Pg-36
	
				CHRIS
			That was a smart move.
	
	Wesker bristles. He's about to confront Chris, but he spots
	his sunglasses where they were deposited on a floor grate by
	the water. He walks over and picks them up, wiping the
	lenses on his shirt. Without looking at Chris, he asks...
	
				WESKER
			And... you are?
	
				CHRIS
			Nobody.  Just a...a local guy...
	
	Chris spots a dry lab-coat hanging on a wall hook. He takes
	it down and uses it to dry his rifle.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			...who gets pissed-off when he finds...
			his farm animals... and his father's
			oldest friend... dead. And the only
			woman he ever cared about turns out
			to be a goddam METAL HEAD!
	
	Wesker, while seeming to understand, still doesn't look up.
	
				WESKER
			Valentine...who is this asshole?
	
				JILL
			His name is Chris Redfield. He was...
			part of my cover, sir.
	
				CHRIS
			Cover?
	
	A snappy argument develops, a lover's quarrel, with higher-
	than-normal stakes.
	
				JILL
			This is not the time to mouth off,
			Chris! You're in deep shit here!
	
				CHRIS
			Why didn't you let me in on this?
	
				JILL
			Why did you have to come after me?
			How did you get in here, anyway?
	
				CHRIS
			I used to play here, when this was
			a fucking laundry room!  And what
			makes you think I came after YOU?
	
	
	Pg-37
	
				BARRY
			(Interrupting) Whoa! Look here.
	
	Barry is stooped over the faceless zombie that Wesker shot.
	He rips an I.D. badge from the corpse's coat.  He tosses it
	to Wesker, who reads the I.D... "DR. J. MARCUS"
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			Is this the pile of shit we're
			supposed to bring out of here?
	
				WESKER
			It...it once was.
	
				VICKERS (o.s.)
			I got something here.
	
	BRAD has been quietly working at one of the lab's computers.
	Barry rushes over and looks at the monitor screen.
	
				BARRY
			A map. Same as on your gizmo. Exits
			marked...blue and green.
	
	Wesker steps in for a look.
	
				WESKER
			The greens are the overrides. (To
			Brad) Can you print this out?
	
				VICKERS
			I can try.
	
	Chris calmly retrieves his wet shoulder bag from the floor.
	He wrings out the cloth and, using the lab coat, wipes the
	bullets dry.
	
				VICKERS (cont.)
			(Off the screen) We're on level 'A'.
	
				WESKER
			We have to get down to level 'D'.
	
				BARRY
			Hold on. Marcus is dead. If this
			mission was about bringin' him out,
			we're outta here, right?
	
				WESKER
			I wish we were, but no. We have
			a potential outbreak here. We might
			be the only ones who can stop it.
	
	Pg-38
	
				SPEYER
			Stop it? How?
	
				WESKER
			There's... an antidote.
	
	Everyone's ears perk.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			We can't bring Marcus out, but we
			can bring out the serum. Maybe
			somebody...can analyze it... and
			figure how to beat the virus.
	
	Jill looks at Chris. Catches him weighing options.
	
				JILL
			(Privately) Not simple.
	
				CHRIS
			(Privately) Not complicated, either.
			We only have to decide... what's right...
			and what's wrong.
	
				JILL
			(Privately) I forgot. You're never
			confused. So...what's right, Mohawk?
			And what's wrong?
	
				VICKERS
			Shit. (At the computer) There are
			no green exits on this level. Why...
			why would that be?
	
				CHRIS
			They don't want anybody up here
			to go snoopin' ...upstairs or down.
	
	Wesker looks at Chris with that odd, confident smile.
	
				WESKER
			Pretty good guess. You must have
			been in the military, son.
	
				CHRIS
			Native American. Exempted.
	
				VICKERS
			(Typing, starting to panic) Fuck!
			There... there's no way out!
	
				CHRIS
			Yes there is.
	
	Chris points at the broken grid above the shattered aquarium.
	
	
	Pg-39
	
	Wesker looks up. Then looks back at Chris.
	
				WESKER
			Not a bad idea. (Turning to
			Vickers) See if you can call
			up... service charts, schematics.
	
	Brad's fingers fly. He scrolls through menus.
	
				VICKERS
			Got it. Ceiling grids, ladders.
			The whole infrastructure.
	
				WESKER
			Print it. Print all of it.
	
	The young man types a command. Wesker rushes over to the
	H. P. and grabs the first chart that rolls out.
	
	Rebecca steps over to Brad. She points at his leg.  Seated
	at the computer, his trousers hiked, BLOOD can be seen on his
	sock, just above his boot.
	
				REBECCA
			What's that from?
	
				VICKERS
			(Nervous) I...snagged it. On the
			desk. When we were scrambling.
	
				REBECCA
			Lemme look at it.
				VICKERS
			(Adamant) No. It's just a scratch!
	
	Chris watches Wesker as he studies the printed charts.
	
				CHRIS
			There's a... part of an old laundry
			chute. It might not show on there.
			It runs up to the kitchen.
	
				WESKER
			I'm not going up. I'm going down.
	
	Wesker, grim-faced, looks at his team.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			I'd like to let you guys off the
			hook. But I can't. I need back
			up. You're comin' with me. Any
			objections?
	
	The troopers exchange glances. Jill is first to speak.
	
	Pg-40
	
				JILL
			No objections. We'll back you up.
	
				CHRIS
			(Disappointed) You said... people
			wind you up and you do whatever
			they want you to do.
	
				WESKER
			Stay out of this, son. You're the
			only one who doesn't have a choice
			in this. There's no place to lock
			you up. I can't let you go, you're
			a security risk. I could shoot you.
			Legally. But your lady-friend would
			probably get all over my ass. So...
			I'm afraid you're comin' with us...
			whether you like it or not. (To Jill,
			pointedly) He's your responsibility,
			Valentine. See that he doesn't make
			trouble.
	
	Jill looks at Chris.
	
				CHRIS
			You up to the challenge?
	
				JILL
			Try me.
	
				CHRIS
			(Snappy) I already have.
	
	INT   CRAWL-SPACE   TIMELESS
	
	One by one, the members of ALPHA TEAM wiggle up into the
	crawl space above the ceiling. CHRIS climbs up behind JILL.
	OTHER TROOPERS are already away, following WESKER, who guides
	them with the help of his chart. Jill starts after them.
	Chris grabs her arm.
	
				CHRIS
			Jill, I... I'm sorry. I'm just...
			angry. When I... thought you were
			gone, I... Then... when I saw you.
			Alive. I realized that...
	
				JILL
			That you were still... fascinated.

			Stop. Stop!
	
	He pulls her into an embrace. She goes willingly.
	
	
	
	Pg-41
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Come with me. We can get out of here.
	
				JILL
			(Tempted) I...I want to. I want...
			nothing more. But... I can't. When
			I'm in this uniform, I'm more than...
			just me. Try to understand...there's
			no "I" in Team, Chris.
	
				CHRIS
			There's no "I" in DEAD, either.
	
	Chris pulls away from the embrace and looks at her.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			I should order you to come with me.
			You'd never refuse an order.
	
				JILL
			You go. You're not part of this.
			
			
				CHRIS
			I'm part of it as. long as you are.
	
				BARRY (o.s.)
				This is very uncomfortable.
	
	Barry, having overheard, is halfway up through the grate.
	
				CHRIS
			For me, too, brother.
	
				BARRY
			I mean this... (indicating the
			iron that's pressing his belly.)
			It's very uncomfortable.
	
	Chris and Jill help Barry up into the crawl space.
	start off after the troop. THE CAMERA TRACKS them.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			This is gettin' old, Man, I swear.
			I been in this Army eighteen years.
	
				CHRIS
			Eighteen years?

			Yep. Two away from the big re-ti.

				CHRIS
			You've been with this asshole since... ?
	
				BARRY
			Since before that.  We were... kids
			together.  Macon, Georgia.  He's...

	UP AHEAD : WESKER reaches a service ladder. He waves his
	troop on. They start to climb down.
	
				VICKERS
			Who knows what we'll find down there?

			Think positive.  The farther down we

	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	The lead TROOPERS reach another section of the ceiling.
	Clustering around a vent, they look down into...
	
	...the "B"-level lab, more streamlined, more high-tech than
	the one upstairs. There are large COMPUTERS, linked by
	metal-shielded conduits to jacks in the walls.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-43
	
				WESKER
			Main-frame. Might have some data
			we could use. (A quick decision)
			Fox, Marini, Vickers.  Down.
	
	WESKER kicks out the vent. He jumps first, through the
	opening, down into the lab. CHRIS watches from behind.
	
				CHRIS
			The man has balls, I'll say that.
	
	Wesker grabs a desk and pushes it under the vent.  MARINI
	climbs down, followed by FOX.  BRAD is last.
	
				WESKER
			Hustle it, Vickers.  You're the guy
			we need.  To cut into the network.
	
	INT   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER looks around. There are THREE Doorways...open wide
	with only darkness beyond. Wesker runs around closing them.
	
				WESKER
			Watch these entrances, guys.
	
	FOX and MARINI take up posts. Brad lowers himself gingerly.
	He drops the last two feet onto the desk, landing on his
	bloody leg.
	
				VICKERS
			AAAAH ! Shit.
	
	He topples, falling to the floor, but pops up instantly.
	
				VICKERS (cont. )
			I'm alright. I'm alright.
	
	He limps over and attacks the computer keys.
	
	GRRRRRAAAAAWWWWWLLLL! Another distant snarl.
	
				WESKER
			Hold tight. It doesn't sound like
			it's on this level.
	
				VICKERS
			(At the computer) Shit. I'm locked
			out. Any clues for a password?
	
				WESKER
			Try... Umbrella.
	
	Brad types rapidly, nervously. Flubs. Types again.
	
	
	Pg-44
	
				VICKERS
			Nothing. Wait. I'm into... No.
			No data. Just some kind of video
			feed. Time-coded. Yesterday.
			It's a play-back. (Watching the
			screen) Holy shit!
	
	We HEAR it before we see it. The sound of absolute PANIC.
	People SHOUTING! SCREAMING! THUDS and CRASHES! GLASS
	BREAKING! Then A WOMAN'S VOICE .
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE (o.s.)
			Please...please.. .if anyone is
			receiving this...
	
	Brad limps around the desk and spins the monitor for the
	others to see. The WOMAN is an ORIENTAL. She's standing
	in the foreground, as Marcus was in the opening video.
	Behind her is a lab we haven't seen yet... with white-
	coated FIGURES... RUNNING... FIRING GUNS.
	
				WOMAN (cont.)
			the situation is completely.
			out of control. We...
	W
	HAM ! The woman is pushed out of the way by A MAN who is
	trying to protect her from...
	
	...SOMETHING that BLURS past the lens, like a pendulum,
	from ABOVE.
	
	In the next instant... SPLAT... the lens is COATED WITH BLOOD!
	As it oozes down, we see a partial image of the same MAN.
	His HEAD is OUT OF FRAME at the top of the screen.
	
	The thing above must have a hold on it... because the man is
	DANGLING, his arms witching. His back has three GOUGES in
	it, long and so deep that they might have been made by
	piece of heavy machinery. We only see this for an instant...
	before the man is LIFTED, straight UP, with amazing SPEED.
	
	Wesker clicks off the monitor. The other men instinctively
	look up above their heads.
	
				FOX
			Maybe the ceiling's not such a
			safe place, after all.
	
	CRASH! The door behind Fox BURSTS open. Before he has
	time to react A ZOMBIE is on him, BITING his cheek, neck,
	shoulder. The two figures fall to the floor, grappling.
	Wesker can't get a clean shot.
	
				WESKER
			Scram! SCRAM!
	
	
	Pg-45
	
	Marini is first to reach the desk, but he helps the limping
	Brad up ahead of him. TWO MORE ZOMBIES lurch in through the
	open doorway. Wesker shoots them, but he sees MORE... can't
	tell how many...shambling toward the open doorway from the
	darkness beyond.
	
	Wesker focuses on Fox, who is still being MAULED, BITTEN.
	Fox SCREAMS. Wesker still has no safe shot.
	
	Brad is YANKED up into ceiling by SULLIVAN and AIKEN. CHRIS
	leans out of the opening, reaching for Marini.
	
	Wesker KICKS the mauling zombie in the head. It takes three
	hard BOOTS to attract the thing's attention. When it finally
	looks up at him, Wesker BLOWS out its skull.
	
	Fox is lying on his stomach, writhing, BLEEDING profusely
	from a half-dozen bites. Wesker stoops down, trying to roll
	him over, lift him up. Fox resists. He's gone insane.
	
	Chris pulls Marini up to safety. BARRY leans down through
	the opening.
	
				BARRY
			Haul ass, boss!
	
	The zombies are heading for Wesker. There are three of them.
	Barry shoots at the one in front. Misses. His second shot
	hits the thing's brain.
	
	Wesker again tries to hoist Fox who, this time rolls over on
	his own. He has drawn his pistol. Before Wesker can stop
	him, he eats the barrel and BLOWS out the back of his head.
	
	One zombie is dangerously close. Barry fires two more
	rounds. No head shot, but the zombie staggers and, though
	not dead, FALLS...directly toward Wesker. The colonel rolls
	on his back, kicking himself away, managing to get clear.
	He uses his own pistol to BLAST the zombie.
	
	He scrambles to his feet, darts toward the desk, and jumps
	up. The third zombie grabs his legs. From above, Barry
	risks a dangerous shot. BLAM! Wesker hears the bullet
	WHIZZZ past his head like a mosquito.
	
	The zombie is hit in the skull. It drops. There are MORE
	of them coming out of the darkness. Barry takes hold of
	Wesker and, with a single strong arm, pulls him up into...
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	...the crawl space, where WESKER breathes heavily for a
	moment... then looks up at his old friend.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-46
	
				WESKER
			That's...two I owe ya.
	
				BARRY
			One. We were all... 'Even-Steven' .
	
				WESKER
			Two. Remember? 'Even-Steven' ...
			is not in my vocabulary.
	
	A horrible MOANING SOUND comes from below, in the lab.
	THREE MORE ZOMBIES can be seen clustering around the desk,
	dumbly trying to climb up, sensing the "food" above.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Let's move.
	
	Wesker takes off. SPEYER, RODRIGUEZ, AIKEN and SULLIVAN are
	quick to follow. The others lag behind when CHRIS says...
	
				CHRIS
			Those things could get up here.
			We can't let that happen. This
			is our way out...
	
	Chris swings his legs through the grate and JUMPS down...
	
	INT   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	...ONTO THE DESK. He BOOTS one of the ZOMBIES away and
	tries to LEAP over the others. One of them catches his foot
	in mid air. CHRIS isn't hurt, but he TOPPLES to the floor,
	sprawling, losing his Winchester.
	
	The zombies have him cornered. He crawls toward his rifle.
	Reaches it. Pumps a shell into the firing chamber. Aims
	at the closest of the walking dead...
	
	...which was once a young man, a simple laborer, wearing
	overalls, with a name tag...
	
				CHRIS
			(Reading) Caruso.
	
	Chris looks empathetically into the thing's dead eyes.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Can you hear me?
	
	The zombie lumbers forward hungrily.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Caruso! Can you hear me?
	
	Pg-47
	
	Chris has come late to the realization that these things
	were once human. Now he comes late to the realization...
	that they are human no longer.
	
	The zombie grabs the barrel of the Winchester, pushing it
	aside. Chris can't bring it back to bear on the monster's
	head. He BLASTS a round through the thing's belly. It has
	no effect. The zombie reaches for Chris' throat. Starts to
	lean in to bite him.
	
	BLAM! The thing's skull explodes. JILL has jumped down
	onto the desk. She FIRES another accurate pistol round.
	The SECOND ZOMBIE falls.
	
	Jill leaps to the floor and starts to push the desk. Chris
	gets to his feet, rushing in to help her. Together, they
	shove the desk out from under the open ceiling grate.
	
				CHRIS
			Thank you.
	
				JILL
			Any time. How do we get back UP?
	
				CHRIS
			Shit, if you didn't have a plan, you
			shouldn't have jumped down here.
	
				JILL
			We have a real problem here, Chris.
	
	Jill nods toward the open doorway. There are more stuttering
	FIGURES approaching out of the dark.
	
				CHRIS
			How big is this place? How many
			people were down here? How...
	
				JILL
			HOW DO WE GET UP?
	
	With a startling SOUND, A DARK SHAPE swing down from above
	and GRABS Jill! Is it the thing we saw on the video?
	
	No. It's BARRY! His mighty arms lift Jill. She's caught
	by Aiken and Sullivan and pulled up to safety. Barry grabs
	Chris and lifts him as well.
	
	
	INT   CRAWL SPACE   LAB   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS grabs the edge of the grate and pulls himself up.
	He reaches back down through the opening. Below, BARRY
	squats... and makes a mighty leap-with his muscular legs.
	Chris grabs his arms... and is nearly pulled back down.
	
	
	
	Pg-48
	
				CHRIS
			(Straining) Big. Heavy.
	
	Jill grabs on, then Sullivan. But one of the ZOMBIES has
	reached Barry. It GRABS his kicking legs. It's TEETH SNAP!
	And CATCH! The commandos lift Barry clear, but the zombie
	ends up with a CHUNK of something in its mouth.
	
				JILL
			It got you!
	
	Barry checks his leg. His trousers are torn, but...
	
				BARRY
			No skin broken. I'm alright.
	
				CHRIS
			We owe you a pair of pants.
	
	They crawl away. The zombies below reach up, their fingers
	clutching, at the ceiling, but with the desk gone, there's
	no way they can get up.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	INT   STORAGE AREA   TIMELESS
	
	THE COMMANDOS climb down a steel access ladder into a storage
	room stacked with CRATES and CARTONS. There's only one door.
	The place seems secure.
	
	
				WESKER
			Stand down. Five minutes.
	
	WESKER sits on a crate and pulls out his printed charts.
	Gradually the whole troop makes it down into the room.
	They relax. A few light cigarettes. But not SPEYER.
	
				SPEYER
			I'm through, Wesker.
	
				MARINI
			Me too, man. This ain't nothin'
			I signed on for.
	
				WESKER
			(Calm) You want to wait here, fine.
	
				MARINI
			Wait here? No. We're gettin' out!
				
				WESKER
			You can't. (He flashes his access
			card.) Not without this.

				SPEYER
			Fuck you! And your fancy doors and
			your green key! The choppers have
			rockets. They can blow out a wall
			if they have to. I'm callin' 'em in.
	
	Speyer pulls out his radio and starts to punch a code.
	
				WESKER
			You wanna see a wall blow, I'll
			blow all of 'em for ya.
	
	Wesker reaches down to the electronic unit that he lost and
	retrieved in the woods. He pulls a long wire out of it, with
	a small sensor on the end.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			I'll put a crater in this forest that
			takes out Racoon City and everything
			else for twenty miles... with this.
	
	He jams the little sensor into his ear and pushes a button
	on the belt unit. Small red LIGHTS blink.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			It's a radio detonator...to set off
			explosives that are...buried under
			neath us somewhere. The ultimate

			That's right. It's your job...all

			And to see that my heart... doesn't
			skip any beats.
	
	Wesker looks over the tops of his sunglasses... at Speyer
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Give me the radio, soldier.
	
	Speyer hesitates. Wesker explodes, for the first time.

	He also looks staunchly heroic as he speaks to his TROOP.

			on your asses, drawing pay checks for
			more than two years. Well... it's time
			to repay those... Government loans.

			Bull shit. I'm not...
	
	Wesker lifts his automatic. Speyer flinches. The action
	wasn't meant as a threat. Wesker is just checking his ammo.
	
	
	
	Pg-52
	
				WESKER
			Pitch your empties. Put all your
			loaded clips on that crate there.
			I want a count. Then I want the

	Jill has been counting the ammo clips.
	
				JILL
			Forty two.
	
				SPEYER
			That's all we have?
	
				WESKER
			We weren't expecting a war, Speyer.
			(To Jill) I'll take three. Three
			to your boyfriend...
	
				CHRIS
			Don't need 'em. Got my own loads.
	
	Wesker's eyes dart angrily toward Chris. But he notices
	Jill watching him...and he calms himself.
	
				WESKER
			Good. Then... we all get four clips.
	
				SPEYER
			They must have... weapons down here,

			No more side trips. It was a mistake

	Wesker stands and opens the door.  Outside is a SERVICE
	CORRIDOR with unfinished walls. Spaces between raw metal
	beams are stuffed with insulation. Wesker checks the jamb
	outside. It's got a lock mechanism. Blue.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Not an override. My key won't work
			here on the way out. Prop the door.
	
	The troopers drag a heavy crate over to hold the door open.
	Wesker moves out. The commandos trickle after him. Chris
	holds Jill behind for a moment.
	
				CHRIS
			Jill...this guy is a Loony-Toon.

			He's just... trying to get the job
			done. Doing what he has to do.

			Yeah, well...I hope you'll say

	clustered at a blind alley which has two doors.
	
				WESKER
			(Checking his map) It's not clear...
			which way to go.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Want me to flip a coin?
	
	WESKER is annoyed by the remark. Decisively, he selects one
	of the doors and uses his green key card. With a BZZZZ, the
	lock releases. The troop enters...
	
	INT   SYSTEMS CENTER   TIMELESS
	
	...a vast ROOM, fifty-by-fifty yards. It's filled with

	and SWITCHER PANELS another. This is the systems center
	for the entire facility.
	
	There's an attendant's desk just inside the door. AIKEN
	and SULLIVAN drag it over to prop the door open. It makes
	
	
	
	Pg-54
	
	a frightening SOUND as it scrapes the floor, echoing,
	bouncing around in the large space. It prompts a response...
	another of those animal-like SNARLS from somewhere in the
	distance.
	
				SULLIVAN
			What's that sound like to you?
	
				AlKEN
			A meat-eater.
	
	There are thick columns, floor to ceiling, every ten feet.
	The spaces between them are very dark. It's hard to see.
	WESKER and some of the OTHERS click on their FLASHLIGHTS .
	Beams cut through dust.
	
	There are ELECTRONIC HUMS.. CLICKS and CHATTERS emit from
	the switchers, PINGS from the heaters, all combining to fray
	everyone's nerves. Light beams dance nervously as the
	commandos start out across the dark and frightening space.
	
				CHRIS
			(Softly to Jill) This is the heart
			of the whole place. They've got to
			have it... protected somehow.
	
	Two things happen, almost at once. First.. .CHRIS notices
	ELECTRIC EYES... on all of the columns.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			DUCK! HIT THE DECK!
	
	Second. A ZOMBIE lurches around a corner and BITES a chunk
	out of MARINI'S face. JILL whirls around to shoot at the
	zombie, but Chris grabs her and FLATTENS her on the floor.
	
	Marini, staggering, screaming in pain, triggers the first
	electric eye. LASER BEAMS shoot in all directions, forming
	a tight NET. Chris and Jill are barely beneath them.
	Many of the other troopers are hit by the beams... which do
	no immediate harm... but wherever they make contact, small
	CYLINDERS above the electric eyes begin to HISS.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			FOR CHRISSAKE, GET DOWN!
	
	The commandos duck under the laser beams... just in time.
	Jets of STEAM spout from the cylinders. It's not just hot
	steam. It's ACIDIC, deadly.
	
	Marini is hit by it. His clothes IGNITE. His flesh BOILS.
	It's a horrible sight, but for the moment, the jets stop.
	
	
	
	Pg-55
	
	Marini is dead on his feet. When he falls, he trips another
	of the laser beams. The steam jets SPOUT again. The troop
	is beneath them, though many are burned by liquid drops that
	spit from the nozzles.
	Amazingly, the zombie has avoided contact. But as it begins
	to stumble after commandos, we realize it's going to activate
	the sensors again.
	
				SULLIVAN
			There's no way outta this mousetrap!
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			So we live here now?
	
				SPEYER
			We gotta run for it.
	
	The zombie hits one of the laser beams. The steam HISSES
	out again. The zombie is MELTED.
	
				AIKEN
			Bad idea, Speyer.
	
				CHRIS
			Down. Through these.
	
	Chris has noticed a series of hinged panels in the floor.
	
				VICKERS
			Where do they go?
	
				SULLIVAN
			Does it matter?
	
	Sullivan whips out a Swiss Army knife and goes to work on
	the screws that hold down one of the panels. Other troopers
	do the same.
	
	Another ZOMBIE lurches out of the darkness. And ANOTHER.
	
	Human hands work furiously, loosening screws. Panels come
	up, Troopers begin to duck through the openings.
	
	A second zombie hits a red beam. STEAM again. Chris and
	Jill are spattered. Burned. But Jill bravely keeps working
	with her own issued knife. She gets a panel open. As she
	drops through, a third zombie triggers a burst of steam.
	Chris ducks and covers.
	
	When the jets stop, Chris begins to climb into the opening,
	but one of his legs is GRABBED from behind by...
	
	...one of the dead things which has already been MELTED!
	
	
	
	
	Pg-56
	
	Its flesh is bubbling. Bone is beginning to show. But
	the acid hasn't reached its brain yet. The creature is
	still alive.
	
	Chris CRIES out. Acid from the zombie's hands is burning
	his leg. The thing's lips have been eaten away, making its
	teeth look frighteningly skeletal as it leans forward for a
	bite of flesh. Chris jams the stock of his Winchester into
	the zombie's mouth. He's able to hold the thing's head back,
	but he's stuck. He can't let go.
	
	Jill pops up out of the floor. She presses the barrel of her
	own weapon into the zombie's forehead.
	
				JILL
			On three...
	
				CHRIS
			One... two...
	
	Chris pulls his rifle away. At the same instant, Jill FIRES.
	The zombie is PROPELLED through the air. One of its flailing
	arms triggers another laser beam. Chris throws himself in on
	top of Jill as STEAM HISSES over them.
	
	Twenty yards away, Wesker crawls under the cloud of acid.
	Just as he climbs down through one of the openings, he feels
	pressure...on his ear.
	
	A groping zombie has accidentally hooked its fingers onto the
	wire that runs from the detonator to Wesker's ear-piece.
	For a breathless moment, it seems like the sensor will be
	popped loose. Holding the pulse-reader in place, Wesker
	twists his body, lifts his hand gun, and PUMPS THREE into
	the dead thing's brain.
	
	The zombie flops over, but its fingers cling, entangled, in
	the wire. Wesker plants his pistol barrel on the knuckles
	of the thing's dead hand. THREE MORE SHOTS cut through bone,
	removing the fingers from the hand. The wire is freed.
	Wesker dives into the opening in the floor.
	
	
	INT   AIR DUCT   TIMELESS
	
	The COMMANDOS find themselves in an AIR DUCT. No room to
	stand. Hardly room to sit.
	
	Chris looks at his rifle stock. It's corroded from the acid
	in the zombie's mouth. Jill notices.
	
				JILL
			God...and it doesn't even stop them...
	
	
	
	Pg-57
	
				CHRIS
			It's not meant to stop them. It's
			meant to stop...something else.
	
	That distant SNARLING SOUND comes again, making Jill shiver.
	The troop is strung out along the metal shaft. REBECCA
	crawls among them, treating the worst burns. WESKER checks
	his maps. SPEYER confronts him again.
	
				SPEYER
			We damn near got turned into Rice
			Krispies by that gizmo of yours.
			If you don't want me to nail that
			fuckin' thing into your ear, you
			deactivate it. Right now.
	
				WESKER
			I can't. They.. .fixed it... so you
			can't chicken out. The system can
			only be turned off at the main panel.
	
				BARRY
			Where the hell is that?
	
				WESKER
			Where the explosives are. Down...
			farther than we need to go. We only
			have to make it down one more level.
			If... when... we make it back up to
			the choppers... we can fly out of
			the detonator's signal range.
	
	Chris calls out from the far end of the shaft
	 
				CHRIS
			I'm not willing to rely on that.
			I live here, this is my town!
	
				WESKER
			The town's been evacuated. Just...
			just in case.
	
				CHRIS
			That explains the lie. About the
			plane crash. An airplane down...
			with weapons on board... would nicely
			explain a big explosion, wouldn't it?
			You figured all along you might have
			to blow this place!
	
				WESKER
			I don't want to do it. I... I hope
			I don't have to.
	
	
	Pg-58
	
	Chris looks down the dim air-shaft, unable to see Wesker's
	eyes, hidden by distance.. .and by his dark glasses.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			That's the best I can do for you,
			kid. Good faith. Now... let's
			knock on it.
	
	Wesker moves out. The troop follows.
	
				CHRIS
			I...I can't let this happen. I've
			got to find that bomb.
	
				JILL
			I'll help. Once Wesker gets what
			he wants, my obligation is over.
	
	Chris looks at her with appreciative eyes .
	
				CHRIS
			No. I want you out. With the
			rest of them. Wesker won't push
			the button until you're clear.
	
				JILL
			He doesn't want to push the button.
	
				CHRIS
			He has to. Don't you see? He can't
			leave these labs here. And, Jesus...
			walking corpses! He's gotta get rid
			of the evidence.
	
	INT   AIR SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	The light is dim at its best. Long stretches of the shaft
	are pitch black, and there's a constant stream of air that
	MOANS eerily. This whole mission has been like a descent
	into Hell, darker and more frightening with each level down.
	
	There are turn-offs, "T"s and "Y"s. At one point, when JILL
	looks back, she finds ROSIE behind her. Chris is gone. Did
	he leave to deal with the bomb?
	
	No, but he's about to. He's at the rear of the pack, pressed
	against the side-wall, waving others past.
	
				JILL
			Chris, no!
	
				CHRIS
			I've got to try and stop this.
	
	
	
	Pg-59
	
	Jill starts back toward Chris, but freezes.. .everyone freezes
	when... the duct-work starts to PING.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Shit. One thing after another.
	
	BOOM! The air shaft is ROCKED, as if punched by a giant
	fist. Then...the whole structure begins to SHIMMY. What
	is it, an earthquake?
	
				WESKER
			Sit tight. Ride it out.
	
	GRONK! A sheet-metal panel BUCKLES! Others do the same.
	All along the shaft, panels begin to FOLD INWARD. Something
	outside is CRUSHING the duct as if it were a giant tube of
	toothpaste. And the troopers are being SQUEEZED inside.
	
	RIVETS POP! The panels begin to SEPARATE...and large,
	pulsing bits of FLESH appear! Not animal flesh. But the
	flesh of A PLANT! The things that press in through the
	openings are larger versions of the vines we saw in the
	kitchen. Those were its fingertips. These are its ARMS.
	Strong arms that are RIPPING the ductwork apart.
	
	Chris, Rebecca, Aiken and Sullivan end up in one part of the
	shaft. The rest in another... including Jill, who calls out.
	
				JILL
			CHRIS!
	
	The section that holds Chris' group FALLS AWAY... with a
	monstrous, CRUNCHING sound.
	
	INT   ARBORETUM   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS' GROUP spills out of the dangling metal, with cables
	from the torn ceiling...TZZZZZT...SPARKING around them.
	The troopers drop out of Hell, into...PARADISE.
	
	An enormous HOT HOUSE, a lush, indoor JUNGLE of PLANTS,
	IVIES, GRASSES. It's like a RAIN FOREST, complete with
	a thick, damp MIST that makes it difficult to see. We might
	be on another planet. None of the foliage seems indigenous
	to Earth. There are LEAVES the size of bed sheets, FLOWERS ,
	the size of armchairs. And at the center of it all, is the
	mother of the deadly vines...
	
	...PLANT 42, a monstrous schefflera, twenty times normal
	size. Most of its limbs reach upward, where they have opened
	CRACKS in the ceiling and walls, to stretch on into the
	facility above. There are also dozens of shorter, beefier
	"arms", each of which act independently, like tentacles on
	an octopus... and each has a large, drooling POD at its tip.
	
	
	Pg-60
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	BURSTS OF GUNFIRE from three M-16s shatter our ears... and
	a ceiling VENT. WESKER and THE OTHERS jump down into...
	
	...a very unusual CORRIDOR. It seems to stretch forever, in
	both directions. It has no doors, no visible means of exit
	or entry. The walls are made-up of multi-colored polymer
	TILES, whose irregular shapes fit together like a JIGSAW
	PUZZLE. The floor is HEAVY STEEL, though faceted. It seem
	designed to shift. The whole corridor looks like it might be
	able to bend, to change position, like an airport jet way.
	
	There are disconcerting signs of damage...claw-like GOUGES on
	the tiles, clean cut HOLES punched through the metal ceiling,
	larger in diameter than any that might have been caused by
	bullets.
	
	And there are smears of BLOOD everywhere, as if some terrible
	battle... or battles...took place here.
	
				WESKER
			This way. (He starts off.)
	
				JILL
			No. That way.  Chris and the others...
	
				WESKER
			If they're dead, they're dead. If
			they're alive, they'll still be alive
			in twenty minutes. When we get back.
	
				JILL
			Maybe not. And how do we know it's
			only going to be twenty minutes?
			How do we know we'll be able to come
			back this way?
	
				WESKER
			We don't. But we'll do our damndest
			to try. This is it, guys. The home
			stretch. Let's go.
	
	Wesker trots off. Vickers and Rodriguez follow. Speyer and
	Barry hang back... with Jill, who remains torn.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			(Looking back) Valentine. You're
			on the clock! Fall in!
	
	Jill wrestles with her emotions but, in the end, dutifully,
	she "falls in".
	
	As the troopers move off, we hear odd SCRATCHING SOUNDS...
	with the high-pitched SQUEAL of metal-on-metal.
	
	
	Pg-61
	
	
	INT   ARBORETUM  TIMELESS
	
	The beefy "ARMS" of PLANT 42 undulate overhead as CHRIS and
	his COMPANIONS look for an exit.
	
				REBECCA
			Th-this thing was no accident.
			It was cultivated!
	
				CHRIS
			And it didn't rip out the ceiling
			for the fun of it. Stay alert.
	
	The plant seems to behave intelligently, with caution. The
	pods on its "arms" dart, almost as if sniffing... then pull
	back...like the vines in the kitchen, like timid animals.
	
	Chris spots A DOORWAY.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Here.
	
	As the others follow him, one of the pods swoops down in
	front of REBECCA, and doesn't withdraw. It hovers there.
	Its follicle's open like jaws, which display serrated daggers
	of cartilage that look like teeth. Inside, a pulsing calyx
	emits a pistil that twitches and swells.
	
				AIKEN
			My mother made me eat vegetables.
			I know 'em all. This ain't one
			of 'em.
	
				SULLIVAN
			Aiken...
	
	
	ANOTHER POD swoops down on Sullivan's back. Its BEAK clamps
	onto the flesh between his shoulder blades. It's PISTIL
	shoots out like a hypodermic needle, stabs him and, within
	the blink of an eye, SUCKS out every ounce of the man's
	blood. His skin turns the color of PARCHMENT, FLAKING OFF
	HIM like powder, as he dies.
	
				AIKEN
			Sullivan! JESUS, SULLIVAN!
	
	Aiken rushes to his buddy's side.
	
				CHRIS
			Get out of the away!
	
	Chris launches himself off a stone retaining wall around one
	of the gardens. Leaping up, he grabs one of the SPARKING
	CONDUITS and pulls it down.
	
	
	Pg-62
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Get OUTA THERE, AIKEN!
	
	Chris ends up having to shoulder Aiken out of the way.
	Tendrils from the plant very nearly get both of them, but
	Chris manages to JAM the semi-rigid conduit into a pool of
	sprinkler-fed WATER around the plant's roots.
	
	A BRIGHT CURRENT stutters through every vine. The plant
	SHRIEKS, hideously, as electricity causes fluids to SQUIRT
	from boils that develop on its flesh, down along its "arms",
	and into its blood-sucking pods...which FLOP, lifeless, to
	the floor, with the same sort of liquid SMACKS that human
	skulls might make.
	
				AIKEN
			They.. .they killed Sullivan. The
			bastards... whoever did this shit...
			they KILLED SULLIVAN!
	
	Enraged, Aiken draws a long-bladed KNIFE and wildly attacks
	the remains of Plant 42, slashing at the thing's dead limbs,
	not stopping until he cuts into...
	
	...something that looks like a vine...but BLEEDS RED!
	Aiken traces the thing with his eyes, up to where it's
	coiled in high tree branches. It's the oversized body...
	...of A COPPERHEAD, with a belly SIX FEET in diameter.
	As Aiken gasps, spellbound, he's STUCK from behind.
	
	The snake is so long, its body is draped on one side of the
	greenhouse, but its head is on the other. With the power
	of a dozer-shovel..JAWS like the open hood of a Cadillac...
	TEETH the size of windows...CLAMP onto Aiken's mid-section,
	instantly CRUSHING his ribs.
	
	Chris finds a skein of ROPE. He throws the long end over a
	ceiling beam, then instantly makes a LASSO out of the piece
	in _is hand and tosses the loop at the snake's head .
	
	Aiken's body, in the serpent's jaws, makes the rope miss.
	Chris throws again. In the seconds between tosses, the snake
	has SLURPED Aiken into its mouth. The rope encircles the
	beast's head. Chris pulls. The noose slips down over the
	snake's maxillaries and tightens around its neck. Chris uses
	all his strength. With the ceiling beam as a pulley, the
	snake's head is SLAMMED against the rafters.
	
				CHRIS
			(To Rebecca) Hold this.
	
	Rebecca is, understandably, not quick to respond.
	
	
	
	Pg-63
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			GET IN HERE, SOLDIER!
	
	In this crisis, Chris finds himself sounding a lot like
	Wesker. It sobers him. It sobers Rebecca, as well. She
	rushes in and takes hold of the rope.
	
	Moving fast, Chris rushes to where Aiken's knife dropped
	on the floor. He grabs it, turns back, and sees...
	
	...something MOVING inside the snake's beaded torso. It's
	Aiken... still alive.
	
	Chris charges, PLUNGES the knife into the beast, hacking
	through layers of fat until he reaches a bloody CAVITY.
	
	Aiken is curled within, like Jonah in the Whale. His chest
	has been crushed to half its normal size. Acids from the
	monster's intestine have begun to eat through flesh on his hands,
	his face, but he's still conscious, able to wheeze-out words.
	
				AIKEN
			K-kill me. S-Sullvan said...I'd
			be.. .better off dead. That...ain't
			never been truer than now. Kill me!
	
	The snake uses all its strength to lower its head from the
	ceiling. Rebecca hangs bravely onto the rope, but she's
	LIFTED, bodily, off the floor.
	
	The rope SNAPS, cut by the steel beam. Rebecca falls. The
	trailing edge of the noose catches on twisted debris. It
	delays the snake for two seconds.
	
	Those fragile seconds give Chris just enough time to reach
	into the open belly of the monster...and pull the PINS on
	TWO GRENADES that dangle from Aiken's vest.
	
	The giant copperhead SNAPS at Chris from behind, missing him
	by inches. He dives, like a wide-receiver reaching for a
	pass. What he catches is...
	
	...Rebecca's arm. His momentum carries her down to the
	floor. They roll behind another STONE WALL that contains
	tons of earth, which protects them from...
	
	...BOO-BOOOOOM!... the explosions of the grenades... which blow
	Aiken... and yards of the snake's mid-section...into eternity.
	
	
	INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	The same nervous HANDS that we saw in the opening fidget on
	the polished surface of the conference table. A distorted
	VOICE scratches over a speaker-phone.
	
	
	
	Pg-64
				VOICE ON THE PHONE (o.s. filter)
			We're close. I think I'll be able
			to get the package. It's been...
			very interesting.
	
				VOICE IN THE ROOM
			Anything you can't handle?
	
				VOICE ON THE PHONE (o.s. filter)
			(Chuckling) There's nothing I
			can't handle.
	
	A hand with an ostentatious RING flicks cigar ash.
	
				HOLDEN
			Keep us appraised.
	
	Holden's hand clicks off the speaker-phone.
	
				HOLDEN (cont.)
			(To the others in the room) I'm
			reassured, gentlemen...that every-
			thing is...under control.
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER, alone in the strange, faceted corridor, packs away
	his radio. He hears... FOOTSTEPS. JILL appears.
	
				WESKER
			Where are the others?
	
				JILL
			Right behind me. Were you...
			talking to someone?
	
				WESKER
			To Washington. To my... superiors.
			They're your superiors too, Valentine.
			Don't forget that.
	
	Jill wonders. Should she challenge Wesker? She has no time
	to think. More FOOTSTEPS come CLACKING at her back. It's
	RODRIGUEZ and SPEYER. A moment later, BARRY and VICKERS
	appear from the opposite direction.
	
				BARRY
			Nothin'. man. No doors. Nothin'.
			We hit a dead end.
	
				SPEYER
			Us too. Cement wall.
	
				VICKERS
			We're never gonna get to that lab.
	
	
	Pg-65
	
	TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG... a sound like a rivet gun resounds
	in the corridor, repetitive, but random, not rhythmic.
	
	
	INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS and REBECCA are crawling through a two-foot high
	feeder-passage for electric cables, their bellies scraping
	the floor, their backs the ceiling. They hear the sound...
	
	...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG! Then suddenly...it stops.
	
				REBECCA
			(Crying quietly) I... can't take
			this any more.
	
				CHRIS
			We take what comes. That's the
			secret of our genius.
	
	He looks back. Rebecca sniffles.
	
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			How old are you?
	
				REBECCA
			Not very old at all. Not nearly
			old enough to...to...
	
				CHRIS
			None of us is old enough for that.
	
	Rebecca nods, forcing a smile meant to be appreciative.
	
				REBECCA
			Jill... told me... you were nice .
	
				CHRIS
			She did? She never told me.
	
	That sound returns... TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...getting louder.
	
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	Down in the corridor, the other TROOPERS see...
	...faintly in the dusty reaches of the dark... AGILE SHAPES
	advancing... not along the floor, but along the CEILING!
	They look like apes, swinging from... What could they be
	swinging from? The ceiling is solid metal.
	
	CLOSE ON: A MONSTROUS HAND, both hairy, and scaly. It's
	fingers have ten-inch claws.. .more like horns... which PUNCH
	upward, penetrating the ceiling metal, and clamping on.
	
	
	
	Pg-66
	
	THE SHOT WIDENS to reveal A BEAST, unlike any we've seen,
	dangling from the ceiling. It is ape-like... and lizard-
	like. With ferocious eyes that glare from beneath an insect-
	like carapace. This thing is an amalgam of all the nasty
	creatures that have pursued us in our nightmares. It's
	called... A HUNTER.
	
	There are SIX OF THEM... as far as we can see, there might be
	more coming from behind. Their three-toed feet also have
	claws that can pierce the ceiling, enabling them to move
	forward... hand over foot, foot over hand.
	
	One of them lets out a GRRROWLLLL! The same sound we've
	been hearing through the walls. Now it echos in the
	corridor, up close and personal. The troopers open fire,
	even before the creatures get in range.
	
	
	INT   ELECTRIC TUNNEL   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS and REBECCA hear the gunfire.
	
				CHRIS
			Hurry.
	
	Chris crawls on. Rebecca is stopped when... TCHUNNNNGGG !
	One of the HUNTERS' CLAWS PUNCHES up through the floor ,
	almost stabbing her. Rebecca SCREAMS. In the tight space,
	Chris is barely able to reach back and take her hand.
	
	TCHUNNNNGG! TGG! More CLAWS penetrate the metal.
	The couple plunge ahead of them, the way Chris plunged
	ahead of the bullets on Level "A".
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER, JILL and the OTHERS spit lead at the advancing
	creatures. Bullets THUNK into their bodies. Blood flows,
	but the creatures seem to feel no pain. Even when they're
	hit squarely in their skulls.
	
				BARRY
			Head shots. Ain't doin' nothin'!
	
				WESKER
			That was the idea.
	
				BARRY
			What idea?
	
				WESKER
			To win. The idea was... to win.
	
	
	Pg-67
	
	Jill aims at one of the hunters, pressing the trigger of
	her M-16, and not letting go until her clip runs out.
	The creature's head is turned RAGGED by the barrage...
	revealing an iron SUPERSTRUCTURE beneath the skin.
	
				VOICE (o.s.)
			Now that... is a metal-head.
	
	Jill looks up. CHRIS jumps out of the open grate in the
	ceiling. REBECCA jumps down after him.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			What d'ya think? Should I wait
			for orders, or just wing it?
	
				JILL
			Wing it!
	
				CHRIS
			You know...that just might be
			the ticket. Wing the fuckers.
	
	Chris takes a careful SHOT with-his Winchester. He hits one
	of the Hunters squarely on its WRIST...which SNAPS. The
	creature drops to the floor.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Forget the head shots. They're
			useless. Shoot for the joints.
			The JOINTS!
	
	Rebecca opens FIRE with Aiken's M-16, giving the others time
	to reload. Barry is the first to resume firing...at the
	closest of the Hunters... at its wrists, which are SNAPPED
	by the bullets. The creature drops to the floor.
	
	The troopers fire at KNEES, ANKLES, ELBOWS, which seem to
	be the weakest spots. More of the hunters drop from the
	ceiling...but they continue to advance, crawling, pushing
	themselves forward with whatever limbs remain intact.
	
				SPEYER
			Run! We slowed 'em down. Run!
	
				BARRY
			Where? As far as we'll get, either
			way, is a cement wall.
	
	There are two hunters left on the ceiling. One of them makes
	a mighty, impossible LUNGE... and hits Speyer like a battering
	ram, slashing his CHEST OPEN with its claws.
	
	Two of the hunters on the floor rush forward, not attacking,
	but wanting to feed on Speyer's remains.
	
	
	Pg-68
	
	Brad, trembling, completely crazed, drops his weapon and
	backs away. He sees...one of those jigsaw tiles, a RED
	one, GLOW from within. He thinks he's hallucinating until...
	
	...the floor JERKS, in a tight spasm. Its steel facets
	begin to separate, sliding away from each other. The
	troopers narrowly escape as.. .
	
	...the floor behind them GRINDS, in and out, left and right,
	as if it were CHEWING. Speyer's body, and those of the
	hunters on the floor, are EATEN by the powerful steel blades.
	But one hunter remains above it all. TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG,
	it continues to advance along the ceiling.
	
	An invisible, JIGSAWED DOOR glides open twenty yards down
	the hall. The troopers run for it, and are met by a
	beautiful Asian scientist... the woman we saw on the video
	playback... ADA WONG.
	
				ADA
			You lost a man. If I had only
			been faster. I was unfamiliar
			with the mechanism.

			God. One of them... is still ..
			Quickly. Inside. Quickly!
	
	The troopers rush into...
	
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
	...a security cubicle. CHRIS is the last to enter, barely
	making it before the door begins to slide shut.
	KA-TCHUNK! CLAWS penetrate the opening.

			Don't worry, it's mindless. It
			doesn't realize that it's strong
			enough to push the door open.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			Sometimes the dumb get lucky.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Hasn't happened to me, yet.
	
	The Hunter GROWLS. Its snout darkens the space between door
	and wall. Mucous from its nostrils spits through.
	
	
	
	Pg-69
	After a terrifying moment, the claw recedes. The dark
	snout disappears. The snorting fades away. Followed by
	a distant...TCHUNG TCHUNG TCHUNG...as the hunter departs.
	Everyone relaxes, visibly.
	
	The troopers turn and, for the first time, notice two haggard
	SCIENTISTS standing across the room.
	
				ADA
			My... colleagues. Benjamin. Toshiro.
			As far as we know, we are the...only
			ones.. .left alive. We worked on "C"
			level. One of the biologists saved us.
			Brought us down here. He knew that...
			he didn't have long to live. He...
			started the mechanism... out there,
			in the corridor.. .and he let it...
			take him.
	
	Ada stares at a complicated control panel.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			I only saw it used that one time.
			Or perhaps...I could have been
			faster. The man...you lost...
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			You did fine, lady. We're obliged.
	
				ADA
			As are we. (Sighing) We believed...
			we would die here. Believed...the
			bomb would destroy us.
	 
				 JILL
			You knew.. .about the bomb?
	
				ADA
			The end for a place like this, when
			it fails... must be a bomb, yes?
	
	Jill looks at Chris. His point has been proven.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			But now... that you are here... the
			bomb will not come.
	
				CHRIS
			It... already came. ma'am. We
			brought it. The colonel, here...
			he's wearing it.
	
	Ada looks at the detonator on Wesker's belt, at the sequence
	of blinking lights.

				ADA
			(To Wesker) Is it true? Are you
			here to... rescue? Or destroy?
	
				WESKER
			Both. (With that odd smile of his)
			If I have to pick only one... I'll
			pick destroy.
	
				ADA
			You're not S.T.A.R.S. You're Umbrella.
	
				WESKER
			Once again. Both. (Still smiling)
			Two salaries. Three if you count
			combat pay.
	
	Ada looks at him with disgust.
	
				ADA
			The man I loved, John Marcus...
			developed the organism that caused
			all this. He... he did it for
			humanitarian purposes. It was
			taken away from him...for in-human
			purposes...by men like you!
	
				WESKER
			No, ma'am. Men like me... are just
			errand boys. Sent in to do the
			wet-work. All of the glory. None
			of the benefits.
	
				ADA
			After what you've seen down here,
			do you think any of it could be
			turned into... benefit?
	
				WESKER
			Yes. I think it could be turned
			into five or ten million dollars.
			How do we get into "D" lab?
	
				ADA
			Death lab. (She slumps) John
			was killed...never even knowing it
			existed. They kept him... isolated,

			The cook. Electricians. Guards.
			People who believed they were serving
			their flag. Scientists. Great minds...

			The product of human DNA spliced

			Die.

			The "T"-virus reactivates them in a

	Pg-72
	
	
				CHRIS
			Were any more of these...weapons...
			developed?
	
	Ada is about to answer, but Wesker interrupts.
	
				WESKER
			HOW DO WE GET INTO "D" LAB?
	
				ADA
			You don't.
	
	Ada glances at an innocuous wall panel. Wesker notices a
	key-slot. Green.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			It can't be opened. Thank God.
			None of us is cleared for that
			level of security.
	
				WESKER
			How fortunate... that I am.
	
	Wesker steps over to the wall and inserts his green card into
	the slot. The panel slides open. Beyond it is a steel door
	with another green slot. Wesker uses his card again. A lock
	CLICKS. Wesker pushes the door open.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			Barry. Come with me. The rest of
			you.. .make sure this door doesn't
			close. Remember...
	
	Wesker taps his ear-piece. Everyone gets his meaning. He
	and Barry disappear through the opening. The steel door
	begins to close. Rodriguez lunges, and catches it.
	
				ADA
			Have...you been leaving doors open?
	
				JILL
			Yes.
	
				ADA
			This place is going to be overrun by...
	
				REBECCA
			Brad's in really bad shape.
	
	Brad is leaning against a wall, sweating, shivering. Rebecca
	looks at his wounded leg.
	
				REBECCA (cont.)
			That's not just a scrape. You
			were bitten, weren't you?
	
	
	
	Pg-73
	
				VICKERS
			One...of the sharks. Its teeth.
			I Just...brushed up against its
			teeth...after it was dead.
	
				ADA
			(Alert) Shoot him. Somebody,
			shoot him!
	
				JILL
			No! We're so close. The antidote.
	
	
	INT   STAIRWELL   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER and BARRY trot down a flight of metal stairs.
	
				BARRY
			What's got into you man? This...
			this isn't like you.
	
				WESKER
			Oh, yes, this is exactly like me.
	
	Until now, Wesker has been steadfast. He suddenly seems
	nervous, anxious. Some of it is fear. Most of it is
	anticipation of the goal which is suddenly within reach.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			This is...what I've been all my life.
			A guy... suckin' up to the honchos.
			Wipin' the shit off their asses...
			all the while lookin' for a break.
			A way to get some of my own! Well
			this it, friend. I'm myself,
			alright. And I know exactly what
			I'm doing. I told you...before this
			day was over... I'd pay you back.
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
	CHRIS and JILL step past RODRIGUEZ. They take off down the
	stairs.
	
	As they leave, ADA opens a desk drawer and pulls out a .45.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			(Looking at the gun) You know
			how to use that thing, chica?
	
				ADA
			Of course I do. I'm a scientist.
	
	Pg-74
	
	Ada CLICKS back the bolt, whips up the .45, and aims it at
	BRAD'S head. REBECCA dives in front of the man.
	
				REBECCA
			No! You can't! Not while there's
			still a chance to save him!
	
	
	INT   SAFETY CHAMBER   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
	
	WESKER and BARRY arrive at a set of PLEXIGLASS DOORS. They
	can't see through them, they're FOGGED. Wesker finds a key
	slot, inserts his access card, and...
	
	...WHOOSH... the doors open. A CLOUD OF HYPER-COLD MIST
	rushes out, instantly coating the men in FROST. Wesker
	doesn't feel the cold. He doesn't feel anything, except
	a surge of triumph. He steps through the opening into...
	
	
	INT "D" LAB TIMELESS
	
	...a laboratory that looks like-the cockpit of a Concorde...
	only a hundred times larger.. Nothing is, recognizable, except
	desks that hold futuristic-Ibokin computers. A befuddling
	array of BUTTONS, SWITCHES, stuttering LIGHTS, covers every
	inch of wall space.
	
	And at the center of it all stands a tall, cylindrical TANK,
	a stasis tube, filled with ICE. It's mounted on a six-foot
	tall platform, like an altar, with cables and flexible tubes
	running out of it. Wesker squints, and through the freeze,
	sees the thing that stands sedated within the cylinder...
	
	...THE TYRANT. It's nine feet tall. Like the hunters, it
	has more or less human form, though it's musculature is more
	defined than Superman's. One of its arms is scaled to size,
	but the other is much longer. Its hand dangles at knee-
	level. Monstrous steel CLAWS depend from its fingers,
	nearly touching the floor.
	
				WESKER
			(In awe) It's called... the Tyrant.
			Nobody knows it exists. Except us...
			and Holden.
	
				BARRY
			Holden?
	
				WESKER
			Umbrella's man in D.C. We need him.
			He signs the checks. (Excited) We've
			got it, Barry! Our fortune!
	
	
	Pg-75
	
				BARRY
			You're not gonna try to get this
			big mother outta here ?
	
				WESKER
			Don't have to. All we need is the
			data. Then.. .these things can be
			cranked out on an assembly line!
	
	Laying down his automatic, WESKER hits computer keys until
	a DISK pops out of a master-feed.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			YES! This is it!
	
				BARRY
			What about the antidote?
	
				WESKER
			Antidote? (Laughing) There is no
			antidote. That was just happy horse
			shit, to keep the team going.
	
	Neither man notices... that the removal of the master disk has
	caused certain systems to fail... indicated by red lights, and
	by the fact that... the walls of the Tyrant's cylinder are
	beginning to run liquid sweat. The ice... is MELTING.
	
				BARRY
			You're gonna give this to Umbrella?
	
				WESKER
			No. I'm gonna sell it to them. Then
			I'm gonna open a Swiss bank account...
			right next to yours.
	
				JILL (o.s.)
			God...damn!
	
	JILL has appeared in the doorway with CHRIS. They both
	at the monster with awe...and terror.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			That thing... can't be real!
	
				WESKER
			It's real, alright. And it's worth...
			more than gold. More than uranium!
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Do we get a piece of that action?
	
	ROSIE has arrived. So have REBECCA, ADA, and the two
	surviving SCIENTISTS.
	
	Pg-76
	
				WESKER
			All of you do. Anyone who comes out
			of this alive... gets a taste.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (o.s.)
			I'm in. I been eatin' shit all my
			life. I'm happy to eat some more...
			as long as it's got some gravy on it.
	
	Rosie steps into the lab, her weapon ready.
	
				WESKER
			Anybody else see it my way?
	
	One of the scientists, TOSHIRO, rushes to join.
	
				ADA
			(To Toshiro) You disgrace yourself!
	
				TOSHIRO
			I...I want to live.
	
				WESKER
			Smart. Anyone else? Valentine?
	
	Jill looks at Chris. Then she steps through the doorway and
	takes a defensive post beside her c.o.
	
				CHRIS
			And I was gonna try to disarm the
			bomb. This place should be destroyed!
			It needs to be destroyed!
	
	Chris lifts his rifle. Wesker is faster with his pistol,
	aiming it at Chris' belly.
	
				WESKER
			Gotcha, son. It's only because
			of Valentine, here, that I didn't
			squeeze the trigger.
	
	Chris and Jill exchange dagger eyes.
	
				CHRIS
			If she's on your side... she doesn't
			mean shit to me. And I don't mean
			shit to her.
	
				JILL
			Chris, please. There's only... one
			way to go, here .
	
				WESKER
			That's right. My way!
	
	
	Pg-77
	
	
				JILL
			Yes, sir. Your way!
	
	Jill presses in close to Wesker, as if completely allied.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			I...can't yell you, Chris...how much
			I wanted...things to have turned out
			differently. (Beat) Goodbye.
	
	Swiftly, unexpectedly, Jill snatches the detonator wire and
	pulls the sensor out of Wesker's ear.
	
	Everyone shuts their eyes, expecting to be blown sky-high.
	
	Nothing happens.
	
	Jill pulls the detonator off Wesker's belt. She stares
	small LED screen which reads... 14:42:16... 15... 14...
	
				JILL (cont.)
			Shit. I got all my courage up...
			and we still have fifteen minutes!
	
	Jill tosses the detonator to Chris. Wesker turns on her,
	lifting his M-16...
	
				BARRY
			You shoot. I shoot, boss.
	
	Wesker turns to find Barry's weapon aiming at his belly.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			Shit.. here I am still callin'
			you 'boss'.
	
	Wesker is holding the data-disk. Suddenly, he feels it
	snatched away...by Ada, who has rushed into the room.
	
	He aims his weapon at her back as she darts away. Before
	he can fire, he's KICKED in the head... by Jill. Buckling,
	dazed, he looks up at her.
	
				JILL
			We believed in you. I believed
			in you. Boy, was I a sucker.
	
	She kicks him again, just for the hell of it. He flops on
	the floor, his eye-socket swollen. He's dropped his gun.
	
	He gropes for it. Barry steps in and boots it away.
	
	A KLAXON SOUNDS! Emergency!
	
	The ice in the Tyrant's tank has melted down to a critical
	level. The monster... is beginning to MOVE.
	
	
	Pg-78
	
	Reaching the doorway, Ada hears a mechanism TRIP in the jamb.
	The Plexiglas doors begin to slide shut. Ada strains to
	hold them back.
	
				ADA
			Get out! Now! Or you never will!
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			So... we'll live here! (Glancing at
			the Tyrant) No. The landlord looks
			like a sonuvabitch.
	
	Rosie rushes in to help Ada hold the doors. So does
	BENJAMIN, the second of the surviving scientists, who is...
	...MAULED from behind by a ZOMBIE. It's not just any zombie.
	It's BRAD VICKERS, back from death, who BITES out the artery
	in Benjamin's neck.
	
				ADA
			I TOLD YOU... TO SHOOT HIM!
	
	Ada lifts her .45 and blows Vickers way. She looks down
	at Benjamin, writhing on the floor, aims at his head... and
	FIRES again.
	
	Rodriguez is the only one holding the doors. Jill rushes
	to help her.
	
				JILL
			Everybody! OUT!
	
				CHRIS
			(Off the LED) Thirteen minutes.
	
	Inside the lab, Barry turns to Toshiro, the other scientist.
	
				BARRY
			Go.
	
	Toshiro hesitates... a second too long. KRAAASSSH! The
	stasis tube BURSTS open. WATER and bits of ICE fly out...
	along with an enormous, bionic HAND. Big-enough to grab
	Toshiro's head as if it were a cantaloupe. Powerful enough
	to CRUSH that head as if it were... well, a cantaloupe.
	
	Wesker, still searching for his pistol, sees all this.
	
	The Tyrant is not completely free. Much of the cylinder
	wall has cracked away, but sections of it cling to a now
	misshapen mass of ice that still holds the monster bound.
	Though it won1t for much longer.
	
	Wesker starts toward the door. Barry grabs the back of his
	shirt and pitches him across the lab.
	
	
	Pg-79
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			You and me... we ain't goin' nowhere.
			Not just now, boss.
	
	Barry turns to the others clustered at the doorway.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			This thing gets loose, it's gonna
			be pissed. Somebody's gotta hold it
			back. Give you guys a fair chance.
	
				JILL
			LOOK OUT!
	
	Wesker has found his pistol. He FIRES at Barry who, ducking,
	is only GRAZED. Wesker aims at the group in the doorway.
	Barry pops out from behind a desk and shoots back at him.
	
	Ada and Rebecca duck away from the doors, pulling Rodriguez
	and a reluctant Jill after them. The doors begin to slide
	closed. Chris valiantly tries to prevent them from shutting.
	
	Wesker CRAWLS lke a dog. He manages to fling an arm
	out through the opening. Steel bumpers press on the meat
	of his forearm. Wesker looks up. Through the Plexiglas,
	his eyes meet Chris'.
	
				WESKER
			Get me outta here, Redfield. Or so
			help me God, you're a dead man.
	
	With his free hand, Wesker aims his pistol at Chris. The gun
	barrel is an intimidating sight, even though it's on the other
	side of the plexi. Chris glances at the others.
	
				CHRIS
			Get going.
	
				JILL
			Not without...
	
				CHRIS
			MOVE!
	
	Ada, Rebecca and Rodriguez wrestle Jill away bodily, and
	start up the metal stairway.
	
				WESKER
			COME BACK! RODRIGUEZ! VALENTINE!
			THAT'S AN ORDER !
	
				CHRIS
			Orders don't mean shit any more,
			Wesker. Especially when they come
			from sell-out bastards like you.
	
	
	
	Pg-80
	
	Chris lets go. The doors squeeze tighter. Wesker SCREAMS.
	
	Through the plexi, Chris catches a glimpse of Barry, who
	stands and gives him a military salute. Chris salutes back.
	
	BLAM BLAM BLAM... Wesker FIRES three rounds. Dusty blemishes
	appear on the bulletproof glass. The slugs ricochet back
	into the lab.
	
	One of them CHIPS away at the ICE which is less and less
	able to contain the Tyrant.
	
	Chris makes a break for the stairs. Wesker twists his body
	in an attempt to push his pistol through the opening, but his
	fist, around the stock, is too thick. Nonetheless, Wesker
	FIRES .BLAM BLAM BLAM... bullets SCREAM off the banister
	rails, but none of them contact Chris' legs which disappear
	up the stairs.
	
	The ice in the stasis tube is turning to slush. The Tyrant
	is about to break loose. Wesker looks pleadingly at Barry.
	
				WESKER
			B-buddy. You gotta get us out.
	
				BARRY
			Not sure I know how, boss. Do you?
			Is there some other...'need-to-know'
			secret for shutting down the Big
			Bopper, here?
	
				WESKER
			No. It.. it can't be shut down.
	 
				BARRY
			The ultimate warrior. The ultimate
			soldier. We'll see. How it does
			against a couple of hard-ass career
			guys, like you and me.
	
	WESKER swings his free arm and aims his pistol at BARRY.
	CLICK! The gun is empty.
	
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
	The ESCAPEES arrive in the security cubicle.
	
				ADA
			The corridor outside... can be moved.
	
	Ada rushes over to the instrument panel. Her hands go to
	work on an array of buttons and switches.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-81
	
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	The multi-faceted CORRIDOR TWISTS into a new configuration
	with the RUMBLE of an "eight" on the Richter.
	
	
	INT   CUBICLE   TIMELESS
	
				ADA
			You won't come out in the same place.
			But you'll find a freight loader that
			can be accessed with...
	
				JILL
			...a blue key. I hope.
	
				ADA
			No. Pot blue or green. Red.
	
	Ada pulls a RED KEY from under her lab coat, snaps the chain
	on her neck, and holds it out to Chris.
	
				ADA (cont.)
			I took it from an Umbrella agent
			assigned to us here. He died...
			like all the rest.
	
				CHRIS
			Red... overrides green.
	
				ADA
			Yes.
	
				CHRIS
			So... you could have unlocked "D" lab.
	
				ADA
			I was hoping it would never be un-
			locked again. Go. I will see that
			this.. .(she holds up the data disk) ...
			is destroyed.
	
	Chris grabs Ada's arm and holds it tight while he wrenches
	the disk away from her.
	
	He folds it over onto itself, drops it to the floor, and
	pumps three Winchester rounds into it.
	
				CHRIS
			It's destroyed. It's worthless
			But you're not.
	
				ADA
			I helped develop it!
	
	
	
	Pg-82
	
				CHRIS
			Unwittingly. They lied to you.
			They lied to Marcus. They made
			you believe you were doing a good
			thing when it wasn't good at all.
			It was evil!
	
	Ada looks deeply into Chris' eyes.
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			The kind of evil that... resides
			in all of us. Makes us... greedy,
			uncaring. The kind of evil that
			will... wipe us out, in the end.
			Unless we stand up against it.
	
				ADA
			Stand up? Against powers that have...
			ruled the world since before we were
			born? We will only be...eliminated.
			Or locked away someplace else. I'd
			rather die here. Knowing that the
			virus has died with me .
	
	Jill takes a step toward Ada.
	
				JILL
			What if it's already spread? You're
			the only one...who knew anything
			about it.
	
				ADA
			(The thought penetrating) But, I...
			know so little.
	 
				 CHRIS
			More than anyone else. You have...
			a responsibility.
	
				JILL
			To a higher command. The highest.
	
	She and Chris touch eyes again, this time with understanding.
	
	
	INT   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
	
	THE TYRANT flexes its monumental muscles. The ice around
	it CRACKS... but clings. The giant HEART dangling outside
	its chest PUMPS rapidly...sending fluids through exposed
	synthetic veins that run to the creature's brain.
	
				BARRY
			That's one helluva big pump.

				WESKER
			An implant.
	
				BARRY
			From what? A fuckin' elephant?
	
				WESKER
			Rhinoceros.
	
				BARRY
			Shit. I figured you knew more than
			you were telling.
	
	Barry FIRES at the encased organ. His bullets bounce off the
	shielding with no effect.
	
				BARRY (cont.)
			How do we kill this thing?
	
				WESKER
			I told you, we don't. W-we can't.
			It's unstoppable!
	
	More ICE pops off the monster's pectorals.
	
	
	INT   RUNWAY   TIMELESS
	
	CLOSE ON: ADA'S face.
	
				ADA
			I don't know if I can face this.

	in the runway.
	
				CHRIS
			Just get us upstairs. I'll take
			care of it from there.
	
				ADA
			Alright. (With a sigh) Come.
	
	They break out, at the run, klacking along the faceted steel
	floor of the movable... and still moving.. .corridor.
	
	KRUNNNGGG! They're nearly knocked off their feet when the
	system suddenly STOPS DEAD.
	
	Ada slams her fist into one of those JIGSAW TILES on the

	A PANEL grinds open, revealing...
	
	
	
	Pg-84
	
	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	...a more natural-looking corridor. Half-way along, there
	are STEEL PRONGS that protrude from a wall. The group starts
	toward them...but stops when a soul-shriveling SOUND fills
	the passageway...the hungry MOANING of things that are dead.
	
				ADA
			Doors... were left open.
	
	INT   "D" LAB   TIMELESS
	
	The TYRANT BREAKS free of the last bit of restricting ice.
	WESKER FREAKS. Whimpering, he gropes with his hand that's
	outside the Plexiglas doors. He grabs something. A BOOT.
	Brad Vickers' boot. Wesker tugs on it.
	
	BARRY opens fire on the Tyrant, full bore, with his M-16.
	The stream of bullets does nothing except make the monster
	notice the big man.
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   TIMELESS
	
	THE ESCAPEES run down the corridor. SHAPES appear at the
	far end. ZOMBIES! Twenty. Thirty. Forty. More. The
	walking remains of humans who were infected in the labs,
	crawling over each other, hungry for living flesh.
	
	The humans reach the FREIGHT LOADER. Prongs, like those on
	a fork lift, extend from a heavy chain-drive that runs up
	and down through openings in the floor and ceiling.
	ADA swipes her red key through a slot and pushes a button.
	The chain-drive Grinds upward, hoisting the prongs.
	
				ADA
			Step on.
	
	Ada pushes REBECCA onto the next set of prongs that come up
	out of the floor. The footing is precarious. Rebecca has
	to hold on to the chain as she is hoisted.
	
	The lift moves slowly, eight feet separating each set of
	prongs.
	
	The ghouls continue to press in.
	
				JILL
			I don't know if it's gonna happen.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Come on. I been waitin' all day
			for somthin. like this.
	
	
	Pg-85
	
	Rosie opens FIRE. Chris and Jill follow suit as Ada steps
	onto the next set of prongs.
	
	Blood FLIES. Skulls SHATTER. Front ranks drop. Zombies
	from behind push their fallen comrades ahead of them. The
	corridor is like a syringe filled with corrupted bodies,
	pushing inexorably forward.
	
	Rosie, teeth gritted, keeps firing while Chris forces Jill
	onto the next set of prongs. As she rises, she hands her
	M-16 to Chris. He slings it on his arm while levering his
	old Winchester, making each of his shots count, until the
	next set of prongs rises out of the floor.
	
				CHRIS
			(To Rosie) You're up.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			I'm havin' too much fun. You got
			a lady. I just got me. Anyway...
			I ain't gonna die in this rat hole.
			I'll make it. Get outta here.
	
	Chris hands Jill's rifle to Rosie, who fires with both hands
	as Chris jumps onto the lift.
	
	Zombies are MOWED DOWN. But more come. The syringe keeps
	pressing.
	
	The next prongs rise. Rosie steps on, still blasting..
	The first zombies reach her. Shooting down, she blows them
	away. But more come, grabbing her legs, grabbing the chains,
	ROCKING the prongs. Rosie nearly falls. She drops one of
	the rifles in order to hold on. She carefully picks off the
	most threatening zombies. Miraculously, she rises out of
	their reach, and into...
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	...a very tight, very dark SPACE with sheet metal walls that
	have been bruised by loads of freight. The rumble of the
	chain-drive ECHOES frighteningly.

	apprehensive, vulnerable. REBECCA, at the top, looks up and
	sees LIGHT spilling through an opening through which she is
	about to pass.

	quiet... but who knows what might be lurking.
	
	
	INT "D" LAB TIMELESS
	
	THE TYRANT, still a bit sluggish, steps down from the
	platform that supported its tank. BARRY jams in a fresh
	clip and keeps firing at the thing. The Tyrant, impervious,
	stalks after the big trooper.
	
	Wesker is still on the floor, his arm through the doors,
	tugging on Vickers' boot.
	
	The flesh on Wesker's forearm is PEELED by the bumpers as
	he uses all his strength to drag Vickers' body closer...
	until the boot winds up in the opening, preventing the doors
	from closing.
	Wesker manages to pull his bloody arm free. He rushes to
	a computer console and types a request for the "T"-virus.
	
				BARRY
			Get under a desk, man. I'm gonna
			feed this thing a pineapple.
	
	Barry pulls a GRENADE from his belt.
	
				WESKER
			NO! It might damage the system!
			I've got to get this data!
	
	Wesker's M-16 has been lying, where he left it, on the
	console. He picks it up.
	
				BARRY
			Forget it. Bullets don't work!
	
	Barry is about to pull the pin on the grenade when Wesker
	triggers off A BURST...into BARRY'S GUT!
	
				WESKER
			They seem to work just fine.
	
	Barry is BLASTED across the lab.
	
	The Tyrant makes its first quick move... making us appreciate
	how fast and powerful it really is. It swipes at Barry's
	body as it flies through the air, catching it in it's steel
	claw. We hears BONES SNAP as Barry goes limp.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			That's it. Take a little lunch
			break, Mr. "T". I just need a few
			more seconds.
	
	Pg-87
	
	The Tyrant lifts Barry's body, as if it were as light as a
	feather, up to its snout. Recognizing that the man is dead,
	the monster FLINGS him aside like so much garbage... and
	begins to lumber toward Wesker.
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			(To the computer) Come on, come on.. .
	
	A monitor reads: 90% COMPLETE...95%...98%. Wesker rests
	a finger on the button to eject a floppy.
	
	The Tyrant is getting closer by the second. Wesker FIRES
	a burst at it which only slows it for a heartbeat.
	
	100%.. .TRANSFER COMPLETED. Wesker ejects the floppy, jams
	it into his flack-jacket, and, FIRING another burst, runs
	for the door. The Tyrant has to move around desks and
	computer consoles to catch him.
	
	Wesker shoves his M-16 through the space that's being held
	open by Vickers' boot. He begins to pry the opening wider.
	A WARNING BUZZER goes off. The Tyrant dimly registers
	the sound. Its eyes dilate, like camera shutters, with
	a CLI-CLICK. It strides forward at top peed, PITCHING
	DESKS easily aside, SMASHING through a CONSOLE as if it
	were made of balsa.
	
	Wesker has pried the doors wide. The Tyrant is coming at
	him FAST. It's going to be very close.
	
	Wesker MAKES IT. He gets outside. The doors begin to glide
	shut. He LAUGHS!
	
				WESKER (cont.)
			EAT SHIT, YOU...
	
	THLANNG! The Tyrant's long, bionic CLAWS SHOOT, with the
	speed of switch-blades, through the opening, just before the
	doors meet. FOUR of the claws SKEWER WESKER, passing clean
	through him.
	
	He doesn't die instantly. He's still alive and SCREAMING
	when the Tyrant uses the same hand, with Wesker impaled on
	it, to PUSH the doors open wide again. The action causes
	WESKER'S HEAD to be SLICED OFF by one of the steel bumpers.
	The Tyrant steps out of the lab. As the doors glide shut,
	the monster holds the remainder of Wesker's body inside
	their path.
	
	The bumpers are stopped by the Tyrant's iron hand... which
	it extracts, letting the doors scrape the dead meat from
	its claws.
	
	Pg-88
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	REBECCA is approaching another OPENING.
	
				ADA
			Level "B".
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT CORRIDOR   LEVEL "B"   TIMELESS
	
	THE CORRIDOR on Level "B" is long and narrow, with only
	occasional pools of LIGHT from bare, overhanging bulbs.
	REBECCA rises, like a spirit, out of the floor. She lifts
	her weapon. Her eyes dart, looking for dangers. There are
	none. The corridor, while very spooky, is quiet.
	
				REBECCA
			Don't see anything.
	
				ADA
			Good.
	
	
	INT   FREIGHT SHAFT   TIMELESS
	
	REBECCA rises through the ceiling.
	
				ADA
			We're almost there. You'll have
			to jump off. The belt won't stop.
	
	As the ECHO of Ada's voice rings off, Rebecca looks up and...
	...SCREEEE... SOMETHING dives down on her out of the darkness.
	She ducks, almost losing her balance. She clings to the
	chain as OTHER THINGS...black, relatively small.. .WHIP past
	her head.
	
				REBECCA
			Bats! There are bats in here!
	
				ADA
			No. They're crows! Infected!
			Don't let them bite you!
	
	Rebecca dodges with new urgency as the black birds dive past
	her. Looking up, she sees more coming. She aims her M-16
	and fires up the shaft. TWO BIRDS are HIT. They plummet.
	One hits ADA. She swats it aside. It drops all the way
	down to ROSIE, who JUMPS, gasping, when it hits her.
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Rats. FLYING RATS!
	
	
	Pg-89
	
	Beneath her, Rosie sees the crows hovering in the light from
	Level "B"... They circle, then start to fly up again.
	Rosie opens fire, filling the shaft with ribbons of lead.
	Another BIRD dives from above and... SKIT... takes a chunk
	out of Rosie's cheek.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			AAAH ! YOU FUCKER !
	
				CHRIS
			(From above) You alright?
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			Yeah. I'm cool. I'm... cool.
	
	Rosie keeps FIRING. The deafening SOUND of her M-16 keeps
	her from hearing a...
	
	...KRATTCH...in the sheet-metal wall. A second later...
	
	...RRRRRIPPP! The metal is torn open like tissue-paper.
	
	SOMETHING dark lunges from the opening. It's the surviving
	HUNTER! One of its steel claws GRABS the chain-drive. The
	mechanism stops dead.
	
	QUICK CUTS: of THE ESCAPEES slipping, nearly falling, as they
	hang on to the chain.
	
				REBECCA
			I thought it wasn't supposed to stop.
	
				ADA
			Climb out. OUT!
	
	Rebecca has nearly reached Level "A"... She's able to hoist
	herself up, and roll to safety.
	
	Ada tries to climb. The chain is GREASY. Her hands slip.
	BELOW, the Hunter lets go of the mechanism. The chain JERKS.
	The escapees nearly lose their balance again.
	
	Rosie, at the bottom, is being lifted toward the Hunter's
	free hand. She JUMPS down. Barely catching the next set
	of prongs beneath her.
	
	AT THE TOP, Ada reaches Level "A". Rebecca catches her and
	pulls her up onto Level "A..
	
	Jill is next, rising slowly. Rebecca and Ada reach down and
	grab her arms just as... TCHUNG... the mechanism stops again.
	The Hunter has grabbed the chain again. Its free hand
	swings, clutching at Rosie, who crouches, avoiding capture.
	
	
	
	Pg-90
	
	Jill is pulled to safety. She turns and reaches down for
	Chris, who starts to climb the chain, his hands slipping on
	the grease.
	
				CHRIS
			ROSIE!?
	
				RODRIGUEZ
			I'M ALRIGHT!
	
	She's not alright. She's trapped. She can't get up past
	the Hunter. She FIRES at the thing. Bullets BOUNCE off its
	protective steel under-hide.
	
	Chris climbs three feet. Slides back two. The others reach
	down from above. Their hands come within inches, but can't
	quite catch hold of him.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			Here! Here, you... lizard. You
			fuckin' cockroach, HERE!
	
	Straining to reach Rosie, the hunter lets go of the chain
	for a second, then latches on again. That second lifts
	Chris to within reach of Jill and the others. They grab
	his arms. Lift him up.
	
	That second has also brought Rosie within reach of the
	Hunter. Its claws COMB her hair as she tries to duck lower
	while keeping her balance on the prongs.
	
	THWAKK! SOMETHING crashes through the wall. A MONSTROUS
	CLAW that IMPALES the Hunter. It's the claw of THE TYRANT!
	
	The chain mechanism begins to rise again. Rosie, cringing,
	is lifted past the monster just as it leans its head and
	shoulders into the shaft to examine what it has caught.
	
	Disappointed, the Tyrant SCRAPES the Hunter off its claw.
	It drops away down the shaft.
	
	The Tyrant turns its CLICKING, dilating eyes up at Rosie,
	and...TCHUNNNGG...purposely STOPS the rising chain.
	
				RODRIGUEZ (cont.)
			(Calling up) BAD NEWS, GUYS. THIS
			THING'S NOT SO STUPID!
	
				CHRIS
			(From above) Climb, Rosie!
	
				ROSIE
			No. I'm finished. I live here now.
	
				CHRIS
			ROSIE, NOOOOO!
	
	
	Pg-91
	
	Rosie DIVES off the prongs...directly at the Tyrant. With
	another lightning move, the monster catches her in its bionic
	claw, crushing her ribs. With BLOOD spurting from her mouth,
	she utters her last words...
	
				ROSIE
			EAT ME, YOU PILE OF SHIT!
	
	
	INT   LEVEL "A"   TIMELESS
	
	ADA is the most pragmatic.
	
				ADA
			Come.
	
				CHRIS
			ROSIE ...
	
				ADA
			COME! You convinced me that there
			were...larger matters. We're at the
			top. You said you'd get us out.
	
	Ada's words snap Chris back into the urgency of their
	situation. He struggles to his feet.
	
				CHRIS
			Th-this way.
	
	They are in the MANSION, which Chris knows well. He leads
	his small troop into...
	
	INT   POWDER ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	...a small powder room, decorated garishly in an East Indian
	motif. A ceramic TIGER'S HEAD sits atop a vanity. CHRIS
	grabs it...and TWISTS it on a pivot. A PANEL spins. The
	COMMODE disappears into the wall, opening a SECRET PASSAGE.
	
				REBECCA
			Hell of a shit-house.
	
				JILL
			The guy was a bootlegger... with
			a sense of humor.
	
	Chris leads the other into...
	
	
	INT   CLOCK ROOM   TIMELESS
	
	...a small, blank CHAMBER. The only thing it holds is a
	GRANDFATHER CLOCK .
	
	
	
	Pg-92
	
				CHRIS
			I hope they haven't disabled this.
	
	CHRIS opens the door that covers the clock face. He quickly
	spins the hands until they hit... HIGH NOON.
	
	GRONNNK! A WALL begins to GRIND open, straining against
	rust, dirt, from years of idleness. Cobwebs are pulled
	apart and...DAYLIGHT APPEARS!
	
				CHRIS (cont.)
			Alright. We made it.
	
	Chris urges the OTHERS out through the opening. At the same
	time he checks the detonator. The LED is down to SIX MINUTES
	and counting.
	
	INT   HUEY   DAY
	
	At the controls of his helicopter, LAGUARDIA spots something.
	
	
	EXT   MANSION   HUEY'S POV   DAY
	
	REBECCA, then ADA, then JILL climbing onto the lawn.
	
	
	INT   HUEY   DAY
	
				LAGUARDIA
			I'm goin' in.
	
				RADIO MAN
			You don't have authority.
	
				LAGUARDIA
			Fuck authority.
	
	
	EXT   MANSION   YARD   DAY
	
	...CHRIS climbs out of the secret exit. THE OTHERS, having
	spotted the incoming chopper, are waving at it. There's a
	sense of relief, of salvation. Only Chris notices...
	
	...a bit of PLASTER falling away from one of the mansion's
	stone walls.
	
				CHRIS
			Watch it. WATCH IIIIT!
	
	KER-AAAASSSSHHH! THE TYRANT BURSTS through the wall. With
	superhuman speed, it ATTACKS the escapees, who run, dodge,
	barely escaping the WHISHING SWIPE of its iron claw.
	
	
	
	Pg-93
	
	INT   HUEY   DAY
	
				RADIO
			What in God's name is that thing!
	
				LAGUARDIA
			Somethin' we weren't supposed to
			see. Drop the ladder. And drop
			the Stinger.
	
	EXT   MANSION   YARD   DAY
	
	THE HUEY swoops down as low as safety will allow. A faceted
	aluminum LADDER unfurls.
	
				CHRIS
			GET UP!
	
	CHRIS pushes JILL toward the ladder. She pulls on Ada's arm
	and sends her up first. ADA begins to climb. Then REBECCA.
	
	The Tyrant closes in, SWIPING at Chris, who just manages to
	avoid the SLICE of its mighty claw.
	
	The RADIO MAN leans out of the door above, holding something.
	
				RADIO MAN
			Catch this!
	
	Chris doesn't hear. Jill does.
	
				JILL
			Toss it to me!
	
	The radio man drops the Stinger...a rocket with a shoulder-
	launcher.. .down into Jill's hands.
	
	Chris hits the dirt. The Tyrant tries to crush him by
	stepping on him. Chris rolls away.
	
	The ladder is too wobbly. Jill can't be sure of launching
	an accurate shot.
	
				JILL (cont.)
			CHRIS!
	
	Chris looks up. Sees Jill holding the rocket launcher. He
	RUNS past the Tyrant, okey-doking, left, right, then dodging
	left again. The monster SWIPES at him with its elongated
	claw. Chris' flack-jacket is caught. Protective fibers fly.
	But Chris escapes without injury.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-94
	
	Jill pitches the weapon. Chris catches it. The Tyrant is
	on him, about to STOMP him with a bionic FOOT when...
	
	...Chris aims at the monster's rhinoceros heart and FIRES!
	
	The rocket CONNECTS, on target. The casing around the animal
	heart EXPLODES... and the Tyrant drops like a giant Redwood...
	
	...on top of Chris's legs.
	
	As Chris tries to free himself, he checks the detonator.
	THREE MINUTES. TWO-FIFTY-NINE. EIGHT. SEVEN. SIX.
	
	LaGuardia drops his chopper a bit lower. The bottom of the
	ladder hits the ground, coming within Chris' reach. He grabs
	on. The helicopter rises again. Chris is pulled out from
	under the Tyrant's steel body and is LIFTED into the air.
	He climbs frantically.
	
	Above him, Jill is still on the ladder as well. Ada and
	Rebecca pull her up. Chris DANGLES as the Huey banks away
	over the forest. The tops of TREES whip his legs, but he
	hangs on, climbing up... up... until the others catch his
	hands and hoist him into the chopper. Chris checks the LED.
	ONE MINUTE, FORTY-FIVE SECONDS.
	
				JILL
			(Reading over Chris' shoulder) We
			have to get out of range.
	
				CHRIS
			No. (To the pilot) Circle around.
			
				LAGUARDIA
			Are there more survivors?
	
				CHRIS
			No. Just...circle, okay? I want
			to...take a last look.
	
	The Huey banks into a circle. Chris looks down at...
	
	
	EXT   AERIAL POV   DAY
	
	...the MANSION. And just over the hills...HIS FARM.
	
	
	INT   HUEY   DAY
	
				JILL
			It's... your home.
	
	CHRIS looks at her, with a resigned smile.
	
	
	
	
	Pg-95
				CHRIS
			I hoped... it would be our home.
	
				JILL
			I guess... we're gonna be moving.
	
	Chris checks the LED. THIRTY-EIGHT SECONDS.
	
				CHRIS
			(To the pilot) Full throttle.
			Out of here, man!
	
	LaGuardia pushes his stick. The Huey LUNGES forward at
	top speed. REBECCA, ADA and JILL are pressed back by
	inertia. Chris holds himself erect. Through the window,
	in the receding sky, he spots...
	
	...AN EAGLE, riding the wind.
	
	CUT TO:
	
	EXT   THE ARKLEY FOREST   THE MANSION   DAY
	
	PLOOOOMMMMM! The GROUND ERUPTS from an enormous under-

	Chris' farm hand, RAKE, is shambling out of the house, a

	The TOWN is EMPTY...except for NINE LONELY FIGURES, lumbering

	of two others are DESTROYED by flying debris.. .
	
	...which catches the remaining three, as well. Arms are
	torn off. Iron shafts from shattered plumbing, shards of

	through billows of dust... drooling hungrily.

  Caption-- September 5th.  Sunday.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  TOMOKOS ROOM - NIGHT

  CLOSEUP on a TELEVISION SET.  Theres a baseball game on, but the sound 
  is turned completely down.  Camera PANS to show two cute high school 
  girls, MASAMI and TOMOKO.  Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee 
  table, TEXTBOOK in front of her. Tomoko is at her desk.  There are SNACKS 
  all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going 
  on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.

				MASAMI
		They say that some elementary school 
		kid spent the night with his parents 
		at a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid
		wanted to go out and play with everybody, 
		right, but he didnt want to miss the 
		program he always used to watch back in 
		Tokyo, so he records it on the VCR in 
		their room.  But of course the stations 
		in Izu are different from the ones in 
		Tokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty 
		channel, so he shouldve recorded
		nothing but static.  But when the kid 
		gets back to his house and watches the 
		tape, all of a sudden this woman comes 
		on the screen and says--

  Masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko 
  actually jumps in her seat.

				MASAMI (contd)
		One week from now, you will die.

  Short silence as Masami pauses, relishing the moment.

				MASAMI (contd)	
		Of course the kids completely 
		freaked, and he stops the video.  
		Just then the phone rings, and when he 
		picks it up a voice says--

  Her voice drops voice almost to a whisper.

				MASAMI (contd)	
		You watched it, didnt you?  That 
		same time, exactly one week later... 
		hes dead!

  Masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance.  
  Tomoko, however, is completely silent.  She begins looking more 
  and more distressed, until finally Masami notices.

				MASAMI
		What is it, Tomoko?

  Tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her 
  friend.  Her words are quick, earnest.

				TOMOKO
		Who did you hear that story from?

				MASAMI
		Who?  Its just a rumor.  Everybody 
		knows it.

				TOMOKO
		Youko told you?	

				MASAMI	
		No, it wasnt Youko...

  Tomoko looks away, worried.  Masami slaps her on the knee, 
  laughing.

				MASAMI
		Whats up with you?

  Tomoko speaks slowly, still looking away.

				TOMOKO
		The other day, I... I watched this 
		strange video.
		
				MASAMI
		Where?

				TOMOKO	
		With Youko and them.

				MASAMI	
			(excited) 
		So thats what Ive been hearing 
		about you doing some double-date/
		sleepover thing!  So, you and that 
		guy Iwata, huh? 

				TOMOKO	
		No, its not like that.  Nothing 
		happened!

  Their eyes meet and Tomoko half-blushes, looks away again.  Her 
  expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation.

				TOMOKO
		Iwata... he found this weird video.  
		Everyone was like, Whats that? so 
		he put it on and we all watched it.

				MASAMI
			(quietly) 
		And?  What kind of video was it?

				TOMOKO
		Just... weird, I cant really explain 
		it.  Anyway, right after we finished 
		watching it, the phone rang.  Whoever
		it was didnt say anything, but still...

  Silence.  Masami curls up on herself, thoroughly spooked.  

				MASAMI	
		Jesus.

				TOMOKO
  		It's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the 
		rumors.

Tomoko looks seriously over at her friend.

				TOMOKO (cont'd)
		That was one week ago today.

  There is a long, heavy silence as neither of them says anything.

				MASAMI  	
		Waaait a minute.  Are you faking me 
		out?

  Tomokos face suddenly breaks into a smile. 

				TOMOKO	
		Busted, huh?

  They both crack up laughing. 

				MASAMI
		Oh, my... I cant believe you!  

  Masami reaches out, slaps her friend on the knee.

				MASAMI (contd)
		Youre terrible!

				TOMOKO
		Gotcha!

				MASAMI	
			(thinking) 
		But hang on... you really stayed
		the night with Youko and Iwata, 
		right?

  Tomoko nods, uh-huh.  Masami dives forward, pinching her friends 
  cheeks and grinning wildly.

				MASAMI	
		So, how far did you and he get?

				TOMOKO 	
		Oh... I cant remember.

				MASAMI	
		You cant remember, huh?

  Masami laughs, then slaps Tomoko on the knee again as she remembers 
  the trick her friend played on her.

				MASAMI	
		Man, you had me freaked me out. 
		I--

  Just at that moment, the phone RINGS.  They are both suddenly, 
  instantly serious.  Tomokos eyes go off in one direction and she 
  begins shaking her head, -No-.  Masami looks over her shoulder, 
  following her friends gaze.  

  Tomoko is looking at the CLOCK, which currently reads 9:40.

  The phone continues to ring.  Tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her 
  friend, looking panicked.

				MASAMI
			(softly) 
		Was it true?

  Tomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly.  Masami has to 
  forcibly disengage herself in order to stand.  The phone is downstairs, 
  so Masami opens the bedroom DOOR and races down the STAIRS.  Tomoko 
  calls out to her from behind.

				TOMOKO
		Masami!

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  STAIRCASE - NIGHT  

  Tomoko and Masami run down the staircase, through the hallway towards 
  the kitchen.  Tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen.

				TOMOKO	
		Masami!

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  

  Masami has come to a halt before a PHONE mounted on the wall.  She 
  pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone.  She 
  takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly.  The 
  tension continues to mount as nothing is said. Masami suddenly breaks 
  into a huge grin.

				MASAMI	
		Ill put her on.

  Still grinning, she hands the phone to Tomoko.  Tomoko snatches it 
  quickly.

				TOMOKO
			(softly) 
		Yes?

  She is silent for a moment, then smiling widely.  

				TOMOKO
		Oh, man!

  She is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she 
  sinks to the kitchen floor.  Masami, equally relieved, slides down 
  the wall and sits down next to her.

				TOMOKO
			(on the phone) 
		Yeah, Ive got a friend over now.  
		Yeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye.

  Tomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle, and then 
  squats back down onto the kitchen floor.

				TOMOKO	
		The games gone into overtime, so 
		theyre gonna be a little late. 

  They burst out laughing with relief again, and are soon both 
  clutching their stomachs.

				TOMOKO	
		Jeeezus, my parents...

				MASAMI	
		Oh man, Im tellin everybody about 
		this tomorrow!

  Tomoko shakes her head, -Dont you dare-.

				MASAMI	
		Im gonna use your bathroom.  Dont 
		go anywhere.

				TOMOKO	
		K.

  Masami walks out of the kitchen. Alone now, Tomoko stands and walks 
  toward the SINK, where she takes a GLASS from the DISH RACK.  She 
  then goes to the FRIDGE and sticks her face in, looking for something 
  to drink.  Suddenly there is the SOUND of people clapping and 
  cheering.  Tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator 
  door to check for the source of the sound.  

  She begins walking slowly, following the sound to the DINING ROOM 
  adjacent the kitchen. 

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM - NIGHT  

  The lights are off, and there is no one in the room.  Tomoko pauses a 
  moment, bathed in the garish LIGHT from the TV, which has been switched
  on.  Playing is the same baseball game they had on the TV upstairs; the 
  same game that Tomokos parents are currently at.  The VOLUME is up 
  quite high.

  A puzzled look on her face, Tomoko takes the REMOTE from the coffee 
  table and flicks the TV off.  She walks back to the kitchen.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  

  A bottle of SODA that Tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on 
  the kitchen table.  She picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink.  
  Before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly 
  charged, heavy.  Her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight 
  comes a popping, crackling SOUND underscored by a kind of GROANING.  
  Trembling now, Tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt 
  lurking behind her.  She draws in her breath to scream.

  The screen goes white, and fades into:

  CAMERA POV 

  The screen is filled with the visage of a nervous-looking YOUNG GIRL.  
  She is being interviewed by ASAKAWA, a female reporter seated offscreen.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.)
		There seems to be a popular rumor 
		going around about a cursed 
		videotape.

				YOUNG GIRL	
		Uh-huh.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.) 
		Have you heard what kind of video 
		it might be?

				YOUNG GIRL	
		Uh-huh.

  The girl looks directly at the camera, her mouth dropping into an O 
  as shes suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright.  She continues 
  staring, silently, at the camera.

  INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY  

  KOMIYA, the cameraman, has lowered his camera. We can now see that 
  the young girl being interviewed is seated at a table between two 
  friends, a SHORT-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL#2) and a LONG-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL #3).  
  They are all dressed in the UNIFORMS of junior high school students.  
  Opposite them sits Komiya and Asakawa, a pretty woman in her mid-
  twenties.  A BOOM MIKE GUY stands to the left.
 
				KOMIYA	
		Uh, dont look right at the camera, 
		OK?

				YOUNG GIRL	
		Sorry.

				ASAKAWA	
		Lets do it again.

  Asakawa glances over her shoulder, makes sure that Komiya is ready.

 
				ASAKAWA
		Have you heard what kind of video 
		it might be?

				YOUNG GIRL
		What I heard was, all of a sudden 
		this scaaarry lady comes on the
		screen and says, In one week, you
		will die.


				GIRL #2	
		I heard that if youre watching TV 
		late at night itll come on, and
		then your phonell ring.

				ASAKAWA
		Watching TV late at night... do you
 		know what station?

				GIRL #2	
		Mmmm... I heard some local station, 
		around Izu.

				ASAKAWA	
		Izu?

				GIRL #2	
		Mmm-hmm.	

				ASAKAWA
		And, do you know if anyones really 
		died from watching it?

  The girl flashes a look at her two friends.

				YOUNG GIRL
		Well, no one that we know, right?

  Girl #2 nods her head. Girl #3 nods slowly, opens and closes her 
  mouth as if deciding whether to say something or not.  The 
  reporter notices. 

				ASAKAWA	
		What is it?


				GIRL #3
		I heard this from a friend of mine 
		in high school.  She said that there 
		was this one girl who watched the 
		video, and then died a week later.  
		She was out on a drive with her 
		boyfriend.

				ASAKAWA
		They were in a wreck?

				GIRL #3
		No, their car was parked, but they 
		were both dead inside.  Her 
		boyfriend died because hed watched 
		the video, too.  Thats what my 
		friend said.

  Girl #3 grows suddenly defensive.

				GIRL #3 (contd)	
		Its true!  It was in the paper two 
		or three days ago.

				ASAKAWA
		Do you know the name of the high 
		school this girl went to?

				GIRL #3
		No... I heard this from my friend, 
		and it didnt happen at her school.  
		She heard it from a friend at a 
		different school, she said.

  INT. NEWS STATION  DAY

  Asakawa is seated at her DESK.  The station is filled with PEOPLE, 
  scrabbling to meet deadlines.  Komiya walks up to Asakawas desk 
  and holds out a MANILA FOLDER.

				KOMIYA	
		Mrs. Asakawa?

				ASAKAWA
		Hm?

				KOMIYA	
		Here you are.

				ASAKAWA
			(taking the folder) 
		Thanks.

  Komiya has a seat.

				KOMIYA	
		This same kind of thing happened 
		about ten years ago too, didnt it?  
		Some popular young singer committed 
		suicide, and then suddenly there was 
		all this talk about her ghost showing
		up on some music show.

				ASAKAWA	
		But I wonder what this rumors all 
		about. Everyone you ask always 
		mentions Izu.

				KOMIYA	
		Maybe thats where it all started.  
		Hey, where was that Kuchi-sake
		Onna * story from again?


  >* Literally Ripped-Mouth Lady, a kind of ghastly spectre from 
  >Japanese folk stories who wears a veil to hide her mouth, which 
  >has been ripped or cut open from ear to ear. She wanders the 
  >countryside at night asking men Do you think Im beautiful? then 
  >lowering her veil to reveal her true features.


				ASAKAWA	
		Gifu, but there was some big 
		accident out there, and that ended
		up being what started the rumor. 

				KOMIYA
		A big accident?

				ASAKAWA	
		Mmm-hmm.  Something terrible like 
		that is going to stay in peoples 
		minds.  Sometimes the story of what 
		happened gets twisted around, and 
		ends up coming back as a rumor like 
		this one. Thats what they say, at 
		least.

				KOMIYA
		Dyou think something like that 
		happened out at Izu?

				ASAKAWA
		Maybe. Well, anyway, Im off.  See you
		tomorrow.
   
				KOMIYA
		See you.

  Asakawa gets up from her desk and begins walking towards the exit.  
  She takes only a few steps before noticing a RACK of recent DAILY 
  EDITIONS.  

  She takes one from the rack, sets it on a nearby TABLE.  She begins 
  flipping the pages, and suddenly spies this story:  

    STRANGE AUTOMOBILE DEATH OF YOUNG COUPLE IN YOKOHAMA

    The bodies of a young man and woman were discovered in their 
    passenger car at around 10 A.M. September 6th.  The location was a 
    vacant lot parallel to Yokohama Prefectural Road.  Local authorities 
    identified the deceased as a 19-year old preparatory school student 
    of Tokyo, and a 16-year old Yokohama resident, a student of a 
    private all-girls high school. Because there were no external 
    injuries, police are investigating the possibility of drug-induced 
    suicide...

  Just then two men walk by, a GUY IN A BUSINESS SUIT and a youngish 
  intern named OKAZAKI.  Okazaki is carrying an armload of VIDEOTAPES.

				GUY IN SUIT
		OK, Okazaki, Im counting on you.

				OKAZAKI	
		Yessir.

  The guy in the suit pats Okazaki on the shoulder and walks off.  

  Okazaki turns to walk away, spots Asakawa bent over the small table 
  and peering intently at the newspaper article.


				OKAZAKI	
		Miss Asakawa?  I thought you were 
		going home early today.

  Asakawa turns around and begins speaking excitedly.

				ASAKAWA
		Okazaki, can I ask you a favor?

				OKAZAKI
		Sure.

  Asakawa points to the newspaper.

				ASAKAWA
		Could you check out this article 
		for me?  Get me some more info.?	

				OKAZAKI
		I guess...

				ASAKAWA	
		Good.  Call me as soon as you know 
		more, OK?

				OKAZAKI	
		Maam.

  Asakawa walks off.  Okazaki, still carrying the videotapes, leans 
  forward to take a look at the article.
   
  EXT. APARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY  

  Asakawa drives her car into the lot and parks quickly.  She gets 
  out, runs up the STAIRCASE to the third floor.  She stops in front 
  of a door, sticks her KEY in the lock, and opens it.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM  DAY

  A BOY of about 7 is sitting in an ARMCHAIR facing the veranda.  We 
  can see only the back of his head.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.) 
		Yoichi!

  Hearing his name, the boy puts down the BOOK he was reading and 
  stands up, facing the door.  He is wearing a white DRESS SHIRT with 
  a brown sweater-type VEST over it.  He sees Asakawa, his mother, 
  run in the door.  She is panting lightly.

				ASAKAWA
		Sorry Im late.  Oh, youve already 
		changed.

				YOICHI
		Yup. 

  He points over to his mothers right.

				YOICHI (contd)
		I got your clothes out for you.

  Asakawa turns to see a DARK SUIT hanging from one of the living 
  room shelves.  She reaches out, takes it.

				ASAKAWA
		Aargh, weve gotta hurry!

  She runs into the next room to change.

  INT.  BEDROOM  DAY

  Asakawa has changed into all-black FUNERAL ATTIRE.  Her hair is 
  up, and she is fastening the clasp to a pearl NECKLACE.  Yoichi is 
  still in the living room.

				ASAKAWA	
		Did grandpa call?

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Nope.

  Yoichi walks into the room and faces his mother.

				YOICHI	
		Why did Tomo-chan die? *


  >* -chan is a suffix in Japanese that denotes closeness or affection.  
  >It is most often used for young girls, though it can also be used for 
  >boys.


				ASAKAWA	
		Well... it looks like she was really, 
		really sick.

  She takes a seat on the bed.

				ASAKAWA	
		Will you do me up?

  Yoichi fastens the rear button of his mothers dress and zips her up.  

				YOICHI	
		You can die even if youre young?

				ASAKAWA
		If its something serious... well, yes.

  Asakawa turns to face her son, puts an arm around him.

				ASAKAWA	
		As hard as it is for us, what your 
		auntie and uncle are going through 
		right now is even harder, so lets 
		not talk about this over there, OK?

  Yoichi nods.

				ASAKAWA
			(remembering)
		You and her used to play a lot 
		together, didnt you?

  Yoichi says nothing.

  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT  

  RED PAPER LANTERNS mark this place as the site of a wake.  Several 
  GIRLS in high school uniforms are standing together and talking in 
  groups. Asakawa and Yoichi, walking hand in hand, enter the house.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 

  There are many PEOPLE milling about, speaking softly.  A MAN seated 
  at a counter is taking monetary donations from guests and entering 
  their information into a LEDGER.  Asakawa and Yoichi continue walking, 
  down a hallway.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 

  Mother and son halt before the open DOOR to the main wake room, where 
  guests may show their respects to the departed.  The room is laid in 
  traditional Japanese-style tatami, a kind of woven straw mat that 
  serves as a carpet. Two GUESTS, their shoes off, are kneeling upon 
  zabuton cushions.  

  Kneeling opposite the guests is KOUICHI, Asakawas father.  The two 
  guests are bowing deeply, and Kouichi bows in response.

				ASAKAWA	
		Dad.

  Kouichi turns to see her.

				KOUICHI
		Ah!

				ASAKAWA
		How is sis holding up?

				KOUICHI
		Shes resting inside right now.  
		Shes shaken up pretty badly, you 
		know.  Its best she just take 
		things easy for a while.

  Asakawa nods.

				ASAKAWA
		Ill go check on auntie and them, 
		then.

				KOUICHI
		OK.  Ah, Yoichi.  Why dont you sit 
		here for a little while?

  He grabs the young boy and seats him on a cushion next to the two guests.  
  As the guests resume their conversation with Asakawas father, Yoichis 
  eyes wander to the ALTAR at the front of the room set up to honor the 
  deceased.  It is made of wood, and surrounded by candles, flowers, and 
  small paper lanterns.  At the center is a PICTURE of the deceased, a 
  teenage girl.  A small wooden PLAQUE reads her name: Tomoko Ouishi. It 
  is the same Tomoko from the first scene.

  Yoichi continues to stare at Tomokos picture.  He makes a peculiar 
  gesture as he does so, rubbing his index finger in small circles just 
  between his eyes.

  INT. HALLWAY  NIGHT

  Asakawa walks down the hallway, looking for her aunt.  She walks until 
  finding the open doorway to the kitchen.  There are a few people in 
  there, preparing busily. Asakawa sees her AUNT, who rushes into the 
  hallway to meet her, holds her fast by the arm.  The aunt speaks in a 
  fierce, quick whisper.

				AUNT		
		Have you heard anything more about 
		Tomo-chans death?

				ASAKAWA	
		No, I...

				AUNT		
		But the police have already finished 
		their autopsy!

				ASAKAWA	
		Well, they said there was no sign of 
		foul play.

				AUNT	
			(shaking her head) 
		That was no normal death.  They havent 
		once opened the casket to let us see
		the body.  Dont you think thats 
		strange?
 
  Asakawa looks away, thinking.

  INT. HALLWAY  NIGHT

  Yoichi has wandered off by himself.  He stops at the foot of the 
  steps, looking up-- and catches a glimpse of a pair of BARE FEET 
  running up to the second floor.  

  A guarded expression on his face, Yoichi walks slowly up the 
  stairs.  

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOS BEDROOM - NIGHT  

  Yoichi has wandered into Tomokos bedroom.  The lights are all off, 
  and there is an eerie feel to it.  Yoichis eyes wander about the 
  room, finally coming to rest on the TELEVISION SET.  Suddenly, he 
  hears his mothers voice from behind him.

				ASAKWAWA (O.S.) 
		Yoichi?

  Yoichi turns to face her as she approaches, puts an arm around him.

				ASAKAWA	
		What are you doing up here?  You
		shouldnt just walk into other 
		peoples rooms.

  Without replying, Yoichis gaze slowly returns to the television 
  set.  Asakawa holds him by the shoulders, turning him to meet 
  her.

				ASAKAWA	
		You go on downstairs, OK?

				YOICHI	
		OK.

  He turns to leave, and Asakawa follows.

  INT. OUSHI HOUSEHOLD - TOP OF THE STAIRS  NIGHT

  Just as Yoichi and Asakawa are about to descend the steps, 
  Asakawas CELL PHONE rings.  She opens the clasp to her PURSE.

				ASAKAWA	
			(to Yoichi) 
		You go on ahead.

				YOICHI	
		K.

  He walks down the steps.  Asakawa brings out her cell phone, 
  answers it.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				OKAZAKI	
		Uh... this is Okazaki.  Ive got 
		some more info on that article for
		you.  The girl was a student of 
		the uh, Seikei School for Women in 
		Yokahama City.

  Asakawa blinks at this, looks disturbed.


				ASAKAWA	
			(softly) 
		Thanks.

  She hangs up the phone.

  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT  

  Asakawa stands now at the entrance of the house.  Dazedly, she 
  walks toward a large, hand-painted PLACARD.  The placard reads 
  that the wake is being held for a student of the Seikei School 
  for Women. 

  Asakawa stares at that placard, making the mental connections.  
  She turns abruptly, walks towards a nearby TRIO of HIGH SCHOOL 
  GIRLS.

				ASAKAWA	
		Excuse me.  This is, um, kind of a
		strange question, but by any chance 
		were you friends of that young girl
		that died in the car as well?

  The three girls turn their faces to the ground.

				ASAKAWA	
		Please.  If you know anything...

				GIRL RIGHT	
		They all died the same day.  Youko.  
		Tomoko.  Even Iwata, he was in a
		motorcycle accident.

				GIRL LEFT	
		Because they watched the video.

				ASAKAWA	
		Video?

				GIRL LEFT	
		Thats what Youko said.  They all
		watched some weird video, and 
		after that their phone rang.

				ASAKAWA	
		Tomoko-chan watched it, too?  
		Where?

  Girl Left shakes her head.

				GIRL LEFT	
		She just said they all stayed 
		somewhere.

				GIRL RIGHT	
		There was a girl with Tomoko when 
		she died.  Shes had to be 
		hospitalized for shock.

				GIRL MIDDLE
		They say she wont go anywhere 
		near a television.


  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH  DAY

  Asakawa and YOSHINO, another news reporter, are watching scenes 
  from the Yokohama car death.  In the footage there are lots of 
  POLICEMEN milling about, one of them trying to pick the door to 
  the passenger side.  Yoshino is giving Asakawa the blow-by-blow.

				YOSHINO
		The bodies of those found were 
		Tsuji Youko, age 17, a student of 
		the Seikei School for Women, and 
		Nomi Takehiko, age 19, preparatory 
		school student.  Both their doors 
		were securely locked.

  Onscreen, the policeman has finally picked the lock.  The door opens, 
  and a girls BODY halffalls out, head facing upwards.  Yoshino flicks 
  a BUTTON on the control panel, scans the footage frame by frame.  He 
  stops when he gets a good close-up of the victim. 

  Her face is twisted into an insane rictus of fear, mouth open, eyes 
  wide and glassy. Yoshino and Asakawa lean back in their seats.

				YOSHINO
		This is the first time Ive -ever- 
		seen something like this.

				ASAKAWA
		Cause of death?

				YOSHINO
		Couldnt say, aside from sudden 
		heart failure.

				ASAKAWA	
		Drugs?

				YOSHINO	
		The autopsy came up negative.


  Yoshino takes the video off pause.  Onscreen, a policeman has caught 
  the young girls body from completely falling out, and is pushing it 
  back into the car.  As the body moves into an upright position, we 
  can see that the girls PANTIES are mid-way around her left thigh.

				YOSHINO
		These two, about to go at it, 
		suddenly up and die for no 
		apparent reason. 

  He sighs.

				YOSHINO (contd)
		Do -you- get it?


  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DAY  

  Asakawas CAR is already halted before a modest-sized, two-story HOUSE 
  with a small covered parkway for a garage.  She gets out of her car, 
  closes the door.  She stares at the house, unmoving.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - DAY  

  Asakawa stands before her SISTER RYOMI, who is seated at the kitchen 
  TABLE.  Ryomi is staring blankly away, making no sign of acknowledging 
  her sister.  The silence continues unabated, and Asakawa, pensive, 
  wanders idly into the adjoining dining room.  She takes a long look at 
  the television, the same television that had puzzled Tomoko by suddenly 
  switching itself on, sitting darkly in one corner.  Her reflection in 
  the screen looks stretched, distorted.


				RYOMI	(O.S.) 
		They tell me that Yoichi came to 
		the funeral, too. 

  Asakawa steps back into the kitchen.  She addresses her sister, who 
  continues to stare out at nothing.

				ASAKAWA
		Mmm-hmm.

				RYOMI
		They used to play a lot together, didnt they?  Upstairs.

				ASAKAWA	
		Yeah...

  Ryomi lapses back into a silence.  Asakawa waits for her to say more, 
  but when it is clear that nothing else is forthcoming, she quietly gives 
  up and exits the kitchen.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  STAIRCASE - DAY  

  Asakawa climbs the steps to the second floor.  She makes her way down 
  the hall.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOS ROOM - DAY  

  As if intruding, Asakawa walks slowly, cautiously into Tomokos room.  
  The window to the room is open, and a single piece of folded white PAPER 
  on Tomokos desk flutters in the breeze.  Asakawa walks towards it, picks 
  it up.  It is a RECEIPT from a photo shop.  The developed photos have yet 
  to be claimed.  

  Asakawa senses something, spins to look over her shoulder.  Her sister 
  has crept quietly up the stairs and down the hall, and stands now in the 
  doorway to Tomokos room.  She appears not to notice what Asakawa has in 
  her hands, as her gaze has already shifted to the sliding closet door.  
  She regards it almost druggedly.

				RYOMI
			(haltingly) 
		This... this is where Tomoko died.

  FLASHBACK
				RYOMI (O.S.)
		Tomoko!

  Ryomis hands fling aside the CLOSET DOOR.  Within, she finds the pale 
  blue CARCASS of her daughter, curled up into an unnatural fetal position.  
  Tomokos mouth yawns gaping, her eyes glassy and rolled up into the back 
  of her head.  Her hands are caught in her hair, as if trying to pull it 
  out by the roots.  It is a horrific scene, one that says Tomoko died as 
  if from some unspeakable fear.

  PRESENT

  Ryomi sinks to her knees, hitting the wooden floor hard.  She puts her 
  face into her hands and begins sobbing loudly.  Asakawa says nothing.

  EXT. CAMERA SHOP  DAY

  Asakawa leaves the camera shop clutching Tomokos unclaimed PHOTOS.  She 
  walks out onto the sidewalk and begins flipping through them.  We see 
  Tomoko standing arm-in-arm with Iwata, her secret boyfriend. Tomoko and 
  her friends eating lunch.  The camera had its date-and-time function 
  enabled, and the photos are marked

    97 8 29.

  The next shot is of Tomoko, Iwata, and another young couple posing in 
  front of a SIGN for a bed and breakfast.  The sign reads:

    IZU PACIFIC LAND

				ASAKAWA	
		Izu...

  Asakawa continues looking through the photos, various shots of the 
  four friends clowning around in their room.  Suddenly she comes to a 
  shot taken the next day, at check out.  The friends are lined up, arms 
  linked-- and all four of their faces are blurred, distorted as if 
  someone had taken an eraser to them and tried to rub them out of 
  existence.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  KITCHEN - DAY

  Asakawa wears an APRON, and is frying something up on the STOVE.  Yoichi 
  stands watching.

				ASAKAWA	
		Look, Im probably going to be late
		coming home tonight, so just stick 
		your dinner in the microwave when 
		youre ready to eat, OK?

				YOICHI	
		K... Mom?

				ASAKAWA	
		Hmm?

				YOICHI	
		Tomo-chan watched some cursed video!


  Asakawa leaves the food on the stove, runs over to Yoichi and grabs him 
  by the shoulders.  She shakes him roughly.

				ASAKAWA	
		What did you say?  You are not to 
		speak of this at school, do you 
		hear me?

				YOICHI	
			(utterly unfazed) 
		I wont.  Im going to school now.

  Yoichi walks off.  Asakawa goes back to the stove, but stops after only 
  a few stirs, staring off and thinking.

  Caption-- September 13th.  Monday.

  EXT. ROAD  DAY

  Asakawa drives her car speedily along a narrow country road, LEAVES 
  blowing up in her wake.

  INT. ASAKAWAS CAR - DAY  

  Asakawa mutters to herself, deep in thought.

				ASAKAWA	
		Theres no way...

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

  Asakawas car drives past a sign reading:

	IZU PACIFIC LAND

  EXT. IZU PACIFIC LAND - DRIVEWAY  DAY

  Asakawa has left her car and is walking around the driveway of what is 
  less a bed and breakfast and more like a series of cabin-style rental 
  COTTAGES. 

  She wanders about for a while, trying to get her bearings.  She pauses 
  now in front of a particular cottage and reaches into her PURSE.  She 
  withdraws the PICTURE from the photomat, the one that showed Tomoko and 
  her friends with their faces all blurred.  The four are posing in front 
  of their cottage, marked in the photograph as B4.  Asakawa lowers the 
  photo to regard the cottage before her.

    B4

  She walks to the door, turns the handle experimentally.  Its open.  
  Asakawa walks in.

  INT. PACIFIC LAND - COTTAGE B4  DAY

  Asakawa lets her eyes wander around the cottage.  It looks very modern, 
  all wood paneling and spacious comfort.  

  Her eyes rest on the TV/VCR setup at the front of the room.  Crouching 
  before the VCR now, she presses the eject button.  Nothing happens.  
  She fingers the inside of the deck, finds it empty, then reaches behind 
  to the rear of the VCR, searching.  Again, there is nothing.  Asakawa 
  presses the power button on the television, picks up the REMOTE, and 
  takes a seat on the SOFA.  She runs through a few channels but theyre 
  all talk shows, no clues whatsoever.  She flicks the TV off and leans 
  back in the sofa, sighing.

  Just then, she spies a LEDGER on the coffee table.  These things are 
  sometimes left in hotels in Japan, so that guests can write a few 
  comments about their stay for others to read.  Asakawa picks the 
  ledger up, begins thumbing through it.  She stops at a strange PICTURE
  obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely 
  round personages.  She reads the handwritten MESSAGE.

				ASAKAWA	
		"My dad is fat.  My mom is fat.  
		Thats why Im fat, too."

  She smiles in spite of herself.  

  Asakawa flips through the rest of the ledger, but theres nothing else 
  of any import.  

  She tosses it back onto the coffee table and, sighing again, leans into 
  the sofa and closes her eyes.

  EXT. OUTDOOR CAFÉ - DUSK  

  Asakawa eats silently, alone.

  INT. PACIFIC LAND - FRONT RECEPTION - NIGHT  

  Asakawa has returned to the bed and breakfast.  As she walks in the 
  door, the COUNTER CLERK rises out of his chair to greet her.

				CLERK
		Room for one?

				ASAKAWA	
		Um, actually Im here on business.

  She passes the clerk a picture of Tomoko and her three other friends.  
  He stares at it for a moment.



				ASAKAWA
		They would have stayed here on 
		August 29th, all four of them.  
		If theres any information you 
		might have...

				CLERK
		Uh, hang on just a minute.  

  The clerk turns his back to her, begins leafing through a guest log.

				CLERK	
			(to himself) 
		August 29th...

  While she waits, Asakawas eyes start to wander around the room.  
  Behind the desk is a sign reading Rental Video, and a large wooden 
  BOOKSHELF filled with VIDEOTAPES. They are all in their original boxes, 
  and she lets her eyes glance over the titles.  Raiders of the Lost Ark, 
  48 Hours--

  --and then, suddenly, she spies a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked 
  sleeve, tucked away in the back of the very bottom shelf.  She feels 
  the hairs on the back of her neck rise.

				ASAKAWA	
		That...

  The clerk looks up.

				CLERK
		Hmm?

  Asakawa stabs a finger excitedly towards the shelf.


				ASAKAWA
		That!  What tape is that?

  The clerk reaches out for it, grabs it.

				CLERK	
		This?  Hmm...

  The clerk pulls the tape out of its SLEEVE and checks for a label.  
  Its unmarked.

				CLERK
		Maybe one of the guests left it behind

  INT. PACIFIC LAND  COTTAGE B4 - NIGHT 

  Asakawa flips on the TV.  Its on channel 2, and there is nothing but 
  static. She kneels down to slide the tape into the deck and pauses a 
  moment, framed in the vaguely spectral LIGHT from the television 
  screen.  Steeling her nerves, she puts the tape into the machine, picks 
  up the remote, and presses play.


  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this 
  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP 
  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.  Afterwards, you can 
  come back here to check the meaning of the Japanese characters 
  displayed.


  THE VIDEOTAPE

  At first it looks like nothing has happened-- then Asakawa realizes that 
  she is now viewing recorded static instead of broadcast static.  She 
  watches, waiting, but the static continues unbroken.  Asakawa looks 
  down at the remote, is about to press fast forward, when suddenly the 
  picture on the screen clears and for a moment she thinks shes looking 
  at the moon.

  Its not the moon at all, she realizes.  The shape is round like a full 
  moon, but it seems to be made up of thin RIBBONS of cloud streaking 
  against a night sky.  And theres a FACE, she sees, a face hidden in 
  shadows, looking down from above.  

  What is this?

  The scene changes now, and Asakawa notes that the tape has that kind of 
  grainy quality one sees in 3rd or 4th generation copies.  The scene is of 
  a WOMAN brushing her long hair before an oval-shaped MIRROR.  The nerve-
  wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the 
  background, but the lady doesnt seem to notice.  The mirror the lady is 
  using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of 
  the wall before which she stands, to the right.  Almost instantly the 
  mirror returns to its original position, but in that one moment in its 
  changed location we see a small FIGURE in a white GOWN.  The woman turns 
  towards where that figure stood, and smiles.

  The screen next becomes a twitching, undulating impenetrable sea of the 
  kanji characters used in the Japanese language.  Asakawa can pick out 
  only two things recognizable:

    local     volcanic eruption

  Now the screen is awash in PEOPLE-- crawling, scrabbling, shambling 
  masses, some of them moving in reverse.  A sound like moaning accompanies 
  them.
  -

  A FIGURE stands upon a shore, its face shrouded.  It points accusingly, 
  not towards the screen, but at something unseen off to one side.  The 
  insect-like screeching sounds louder. 
  --

  Close up on inhuman, alien-looking EYE.  Inside that eye a single 
  character is reflected in reverse:  SADA, meaning "chastity."

  The eye blinks once, twice.  The symbol remains.
  ---

  A long shot of an outdoor, uncovered WELL.
  ----

  Sudden loud, blinding STATIC as the tape ends.

  Asakawa turns the TV off, looking physically drained.  She sighs shakily 
  and slumps forward, resting on her knees.  Just then, she glances at the 
  television screen.  She sees, reflected, a small FIGURE in a white gown 
  standing at the rear of the room.  Shocked, Asakawa draws in breath, 
  spins around.

  The room is empty.  Asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket--

  --and the RINGING of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks.  Zombie-
  like, she walks towards the telephone, picks it up wordlessly.  

  From the other end comes the same metallic, insectoid SQUEAKING heard on 
  the video.  Asakawa slams the phone down and glances up at the CLOCK.  
  Its about seven minutes after 7 P.M.

				ASAKAWA	
			(to herself) 
		One week

  Asakawa grabs her coat, pops the tape out of the deck, and runs out the 
  door.

  EXT. STREET  DAY

  It is dark and raining heavily.  Yoichi, Asakawas son, is walking to 
  school, UMBRELLA firmly in hand.  The sidewalk is quite narrow, and Yoichi 
  comes to a halt when a second PERSON comes from the opposite direction, 
  blocking his way. Yoichi slowly raises his umbrella, peers up to look at 
  this other pedestrian.  It is a MAN, a BAG slung over one shoulder.  He 
  has a beard; unusual for Japan where clean-shaven is the norm.  

  The two continue looking directly at each other, neither moving nor 
  speaking.  Yoichi then walks around the persons left and continues on his
   way.  The man resumes walking as well.

  Caption-- September 14th.  Tuesday.

  EXT. OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT DOOR - DAY  

  The bearded man, whose name is RYUJI, reaches out to press the DOORBELL, 
  but the door has already opened from within.  Asakawa leans out, holding 
  the door open for him.  Neither of them speaks.  Wordlessly, Ryuji enters 
  the apartment.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - DAY  

  Ryuji puts his bag down, looks around the apartment.  The interior is dark, 
  ominous somehow.  He takes his JACKET off and wanders into the living room.  
  Asakawa is in the kitchen behind him, preparing TEA.  Ryuji spies the 
  collection of FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS in living room.

				RYUJI
		Yoichis in elementary school 
		already, is he?

				ASAKAWA	
		His first year.  What about you, 
		Ryuji?  How have you been 
		recently?

				RYUJI		
		Same as always.

  She takes a seat next to him, serves the tea.  On the coffee table 
  before them is a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked case.

				ASAKAWA
		And money is...?

				RYUJI
		Im teaching at university.

  Ryuji picks up his cup of tea but stops, grimacing, before it is to his 
  lips.  He rubs his forehead as if experiencing a sudden headache.  Ryuji 
  shakes it off and quickly regains his composure.

				RYUJI
		Anyway.  You said that the phone rang?

				ASAKAWA
		Thats right.

				RYUJI		
		So if I watch it too, that phone over 
		there--

  He gestures with his mug 

				RYUJI (contd)
		--should ring.

				ASAKAWA
		Ryuji, four people have already 
		died.  On the same day!

				RYUJI
			(flippant) 
		Well, why dont you try calling 
		an exorcist?

  He takes a sip of his tea.  Asakawa reaches quickly, grabs something 
  from the bookshelf behind her-- a POLAROID CAMERA.    She shoves it 
  into Ryujis hands, then turns to look down at the floor.

				ASAKAWA	
		Take my picture.

  Ryuji raises the camera to his eye.

				RYUJI		
		Turn this way.


				ASAKAWA	
			(unmoving) 
		Hurry up and take it.

  Ryuji snaps off a shot.  It comes out the other end and he takes it, 
  waits impatiently for an image to appear.  When it does, all he can 
  do is pass it wordlessly over to Asakawa.  Her face is twisted, 
  misshapen.  

  Just like the picture of Tomoko and her friends.

  Asakawa stares at it, horrified.  By the time she finally looks up, 
  Ryuji has already risen from his seat and slid the videotape into the 
  VCR.  Again, the screen is filled with static, only to be replaced 
  with what looks like the moon.  Asakawa slams the Polaroid on the 
  coffee table and goes outside onto the veranda.  

  EXT. VERANDA - DAY  

  Asakawa stares out at a view of the houses shaded in cloud and rain. 
  There is a knock on the glass door behind her.  A moment later, 
  Ryuji slides the door open.

				RYUJI		
		Its over.

  Asakawa re-enters her apartment.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

				RYUJI		
		Well, it looks like your phones not 
		ringing.

  Ryuji pops the tape from the deck, hands it to Asakawa.

				RYUJI	
		Make me a copy of this, will you?  
		Id like to do a little research
		of my own. Theres no reason to 
		write us off as dead just yet. 

  He dramatically takes a seat.

				RYUJI	(contd)
		If theres a video, that means that 
		somebody had to make it.

				ASAKAWA	
		Theres the guest list from the 
		cottage to look into... and the 
		possibility of someone hacking 
		into the local stations broadcast 
		signals.

  Asakawa pulls a NOTEPAD from her purse and begins busily scribbling 
  away.


  INT. NEWS STATION - DAY  

  Okazaki putters around.

  Caption- September 15th.  Tuesday.

  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH  DAY

  Asakawa sits by herself, reviewing the videotape.  She is replaying 
  the very last scene, an outdoor shot of a well.  She stares at it 
  carefully, and notices...

  The tape ends, filling the screen with static.  A split-second 
  afterwards, there is a KNOCK on the door and Okazaki enters, holding 
  a FILE.  Asakawa momentarily forgets about the video.

				OKAZAKI	
			(handing her the file)
		Heres that guest list you wanted.

				ASAKAWA	
		Oh, thanks.

				OKAZAKI	
		What are you gonna do with this?

				ASAKAWA	
		Uh... sorry, Im working on 
		something personal.

  EXT. IN FRONT OF A TRAIN STATION - DAY  

  Some quick shots of a FOUNTAIN gushing water, PIGEONS flapping away 
  looking agitated.  CUT to Ryuji sitting on a BENCH.  Hes deep in 
  thought, writing in a NOTEPAD. There are multitudes of PEOPLE about 
  him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going.  A PAIR 
  OF LEGS attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears, 
  heading directly for Ryuji.  Her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as 
  that pace progresses all other sounds FADE into the background, so 
  that all we can hear is the CLOMP, CLOMP as those legs walk to stand 
  just before Ryuji.  The pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime.  

  A gust of WIND rips by.  Ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his 
  ears rings the same hollowed, multi-voiced BABBLING heard on the 
  videotape.  The sound grows stronger.

				RYUJI (VO)
 		So, it was you.  You did it.

  The babbling fades, disappears as slowly the worlds normal 
  background sounds return.  Ryuji looks up, but the woman in white 
  is nowhere to be seen.

  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT  AFTERNOON

  Ryuji rides up on a BICYCLE. He turns the corner towards his 
  apartment and finds Asakawa seated on the steps, waiting for him.

				RYUJI		
		Hey.

  Asakawa notes in his face that something is wrong.

				ASAKAWA
 		What happened to you?

				RYUJI
			(gruffly)
		Nothing.

  He enters the building, carrying his bicycle.  Asakawa follows.

  INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON  

  The two walk down the hallway towards the FRONT DOOR to Ryujis 
  apartment.  He unlocks the door and they enter.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  AFTERNOON

  Ryuji and Asakawa enter the living room.

				RYUJI
		So, whatd you come up with?

				ASAKAWA
		I dont think any of the guests on 
		the list brought the tape with them.  
		I couldnt confirm it face-to-face 
		of course, but even over the phone I 
		got the feeling they were all being 
		upfront with me.

 				RYUJI
		How about the other angle?  Pirate 
		signals or...

  Asakawa shakes her head.

				ASAKAWA
		Therere no traces of any illegal 
		television signals being broadcast 
		around Izu. 

  She reaches into her purse, pulls out a large white ENVELOPE.


				ASAKAWA
		Heres that copy of the videotape 
		you wanted.

  Ryuji tears the package open.  He squats down on the tatami in 
  frontof his TV and slides the tape in.  Asakawa sits on the 
  tatami as well, but positions herself away from the TV and keeps 
  her eyes averted.  Ryuji glares over his shoulder at her.

				RYUJI
			(sternly) 
		Asakawa.

  She reluctantly scoots closer, looks up at the screen.  Ryuji 
  fast-forwards the tape a bit, stopping at the scene where the 
  woman is brushing her long hair before an oval mirror.  He puts 
  the video on frame-by-frame. 

				RYUJI
		Have you ever seen this woman?

  Asakawa regards the screen intently.

				ASAKAWA
 		No...

  The tape advances to the scene where the mirror suddenly changes 
  positions.  When it does, we can again see the small figure in the 
  white gown, a figure with long black hair. When Ryuji sees this 
  his body stiffens, becomes tense.  Asakawa notices but says nothing.  
  She also notices something else.

				ASAKAWA
			(excitedly) 
		Theres something strange about 
		this shot.

  She takes the remote from Ryuji, rewinds it a ways.  Onscreen, the 
  woman begins coming her long hair again.

				ASAKAWA	
		From this angle, the mirror should 
		be reflecting whoevers filming.

				RYUJI		
		So, what does that mean?

  Asakawa lets out a short sigh.

				ASAKAWA	
		Well, if the person who made this 
		is a pro, thered be a way around 
		that, I guess, but still...

  The screen changes, showing the mass of squiggling kanji characters 
  again.

				RYUJI		
			(reading) 
		Volcanic eruption... Eruption where?

  He pauses the screen, trying to make sense of what is written.


				ASAKAWA	
		This is gonna be impossible to figure 
		out on just a regular TV screen, 
		dont you think?

  They are both still staring at the screen when from behind them comes 
  the SOUND of someone opening the front door.  Ryuji turns off the TV, 
  ejects the tape from the deck.

				RYUJI	
		Come on in.

  Asakawa flashes a look at Ryuji and then turns her head back towards 
  the front door to see who has entered.  A cute, nervous-looking young 
  GIRL with short hair approaches slowly.  She is carrying a PLASTIC BAG 
  filled with groceries.

				RYUJI	
		Asakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai.

  He turns, addresses Mai.

				RYUJI	(contd)	
		This is Asakawa, my ex-wife.

  Ryuji gets up and walks conveniently away.

				MAI		
		Nice to meet you.  Im Takano.

				ASAKAWA	
		Asakawa. *


  > * As you may already be aware, Japanese name order is the 
  >opposite of Englishs, and even close friends may continue to
  >address one another by their last names.  Incidentally, Asakawas
  >first name is Reiko.  In this scene, Mai deferentially refers
  >to Ryuji as sensei, meaning teacher.


  Mai sets the bag of groceries down and chases after Ryuji.  He is 
  putting on his jacket and getting ready to leave.

				MAI	
		Sensei, the people from the 
		publishing company called about 
		the deadline on your thesis again. 

				RYUJI		
			(brusquely) 
		Whatre they talkin to you 
		about it for?

				MAI		
		Because they can never get a 
		hold of you.

  Ryuji picks up his keys, video firmly in hand.

				RYUJI		
		Ask them to wait another week.

				MAI		
		Sensei, ask them yourself, 
		please.

  Ryuji is already headed for the door.  His back is to her as he 
  responds.

				RYUJI	
		OK, OK.

  Asakawa walks after him.  They leave.

  Mai pouts unhappily a bit, and then breaks into a smile as an idea 
  crosses her mind.  She walks across the room to where Ryuji has set 
  up a large BLACKBOARD filled with mathematical equations.  Grinning, 
  Mai rubs out part of one equation with her sleeve and writes in a 
  new value.

  INT. NEWS STATION  HALLWAY - NIGHT  

  Asakawa and Ryuji stride purposefully.  They stop before a DOOR to 
  the right, which Asakawa unlocks.  They both walk in.

  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH - NIGHT 

  Asakawa and Ryuji sit in a completely darkened room, their eyes 
  glued to the television MONITOR.  They are again watching the scene 
  with the fragmented kanji characters, but despite their efforts have 
  been able to identify only one additional word, bringing the total 
  to three:

	volcanic eruption	  local	     residents

				RYUJI		
		This is impossible.

  Ryuji fast forwards, stopping at the scene with the kanji reflected
  inside an alien-looking EYE.  He reads the kanji aloud. 

				RYUJI
		Sada... 

  Ryuji moves to make a note of this, notices the time.

				RYUJI
		Is Yoichi gonna be all right?

				ASAKAWA	
			(sadly) 
		Hes used to it...

  Short silence.  Ryuji breaks it by gesturing towards the screen. 


				RYUJI
		Whoever made this had to have left 
		some kind of clue behind.  Theyre 
		probably waiting for us to find it.

  Asakawa turns a DIAL to bring up the volume, which up until now has 
  been  on mute.  The room is filled with an eerie, metallic GRATING, 
  and Asakawa spins the dial again, shutting it off.  Just as she does, 
  Ryujis eyes widen.

				RYUJI	
		Wait a minute.

  He turns the dial again, punches a few buttons as if searching for 
  something.  He listens carefully, and when he hears that strange 
  something again he stops, looks at the screen.

  It is paused at the scene with the figure, pointing, a CLOTH draped 
  over its head.  The figure now looks oddly like a messenger.

  Ryuji and Asakawa exchange glances.  This could be it.  Ryuji flips 
  some more switches, setting the sound for super-slow mo.  What follows 
  is a strange, labored sort of speech- a hidden message-- framed in 
  the skittering distortion of the tape in slow motion. 

				TAPE	
		Shoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou...  
		boooouuuukonn ga kuuru zouuu...

				RYUJI	
			(repeating) 
		Shoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru 
		zo.  Did you hear that, too?

  Asakawa nods.  Ryuji is already writing it down excitedly.

				ASAKAWA	
		What does that mean?

  Ryuji tears the sheet of paper off the notepad, folds it, and tucks 
  it into his shirt pocket.

				RYUJI		
		Im gonna check it out.

  EXT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT COMPLEX - MORNING  

  Yoichi is walking to school.  He looks back over his shoulder, just 
  once,then resumes walking.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - MORNING

  All the lights are turned off, and she is sitting on the living room 
  couch watching the footage of her café interview with the junior high 
  school girls.  

  Caption-- September 16th.  Thursday.

  Just when the girl in the interview mentions that whomever watches 
  the video is supposed to afterwards receive a phone call, Asakawas 
  own phone RINGS, startling her. She runs to answer it.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		Ive got it.  Its a dialect, just 
		like I thought.  SHOUMON means 
		playing in the water and BOUKON
 		means monster. *


  >* Translated from standard Japanese, the phrase from the videotape 
  >would initially have sounded like, "If only SHOUMON then the 
  >BOUKON will come."  These two capitalized words, later identified to 
  >be dialectical, were at the time completely incomprehensible to Ryuji 
  >and Asakawa.  Dialect can vary dramatically from region to region in 
  >Japan, to the point of speakers of different dialect being unable to
  >understand one another.  

  >The phrase on the tape can now be rendered, "If you keep playing in 
  >the water, the monster will come for you."


				ASAKAWA	
		But, dialect from where?

				RYUJI	
		Oshima.  And the site of our 
		eruption is Mt. Mihara.

  INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT  

  Ryuji and Asakawa are seated at cubicles, looking through bound 
  ARCHIVES of old newspaper articles.  Asakawa sneaks a look at Ryuji, 
  stands up and walks off a little ways.  She has already pulled out her 
  cell phone.

				ASAKAWA	
			(whispering, on phone) 
		Yoichi?  Im gonna be a little 
		late tonight, honey. 

  Ryuji looks over his shoulder at her, scowls.

				ASAKAWA
		You can do it yourself, right?  OK.  
		Sorry.  Bye.

  She hangs up, returns to her seat at the cubicle.  She resumes her 
  scanning of the newspaper articles, and Ryuji shoots her another scowl.  
  Asakawa turns a page and then stops, frowning.  She has spied an article 
  that looks like...

  Nervously, Asakawa puts the thumb and forefinger of each hand together, 
  forming the shape of a rectangle.  Or a screen.  She places the rectangle
  over the article she has just discovered, its headlines reading:

    Mount Mihara Erupts 	Local Residents Urged to Take Precautions

  Ryuji notices her, leans forward excitedly.

				ASAKAWA	
		Ive got it!  This old article...

  The two scan the remainder of the page, and find a smaller, related 
  article.	

    Did Local Girl Predict Eruption?
    A young lady from Sashikiji prefecture...

  The two read over both articles, absorbing the details.  Ryuji stands 
  suddenly, gathering his things.

				ASAKAWA
		What are you doing?

				RYUJI		
		Has your newspaper got someone out 
		there at Oshima?

				ASAKAWA	
		I think so.  There should be a 
		correspondent out there.

				RYUJI	
		I need you to find out, and let me 
		know how to get hold of him.
		Tonight.

  He begins walking briskly away.  Asakawa chases after him.

				ASAKAWA	
		What do you think youre--?

				RYUJI	
			(angrily) 
		Youve only got four days left, 
		Asakawa!  Your newspaper contact 
		and I can handle this from here 
		on out.  You just stay with Yoichi.

  Ryuji strides off.  Asakawa stands motionless.

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY  

  A car speeds along.  CUT to a gravel DRIVEWAY leading up to a wooden, 
  traditional-style HOUSE.  Kouichi, Asakawas father, is standing before 
  the entrance and puttering around in his GARDEN.  The car from the 
  previous shot drives up, comes to a halt.  The passenger door opens and 
  Yoichi hops out, running towards the old man.  Asakawa walks leisurely 
  after her son.


				YOICHI	
		Grandpa!

				KOUICHI	
		Whoa, there!  So, you made it, huh?

  Caption-- September 17th.  Friday.

				ASAKAWA
		Yoichi says hes looking forward to 
		doing some fishing with you.

				KOUICHI	
		Is that so?

  Yoichi begins tugging excitedly at his grandfathers arm.

				YOICHI	
		Cmon grandpa, lets go!

				KOUICHI	
		OK, OK.  Well get our things 
		together and then we can go.


  EXT. RIVER  DAY  

  Asakawa stands on a RIVERBANK while her father and Yoichi, GUMBOOTS on, 
  are ankle-deep in a shallow river.  Yoichi holds a small NET, and 
  Asakawas dad is pointing and chattering excitedly. 

				KOUICHI
		There he is!  Cmon, there he is, 
		dont let him go!

  Yoichi tries to scoop up the fish his grandfather is pointing out.

				KOUICHI
		Oh, oh!  Ah... guess he got away, 
		huh?

				YOICHI	
		That was your fault, grandpa.

  Asakawas father laughs.

				KOUICHI	
		Well, whaddya say we try again?

  He begins sloshing noisily out to the center of the stream, Yoichi in 
  tow.

				KOUICHI
		Well get im this time.

  Asakawa looks away, pensive.

  INT. KOUICHIS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT  

  Yoichi is passed out asleep on the tatami mats.  A TELEVISION looms 
  inone corner of the living room, but it is switched off.  The 
  SLIDING DOORS to the adjacent guest room are open and we can see 
  futons set out, ready for bed.

  Asakawa enters the living room and, seeing Yoichi, scoops him up in
  her arms and carries him over to the guest room.

				YOICHI
			(sleepily) 
		How was work, mommy?

  Asakawa tucks him into the futons and walks silently off.

  INT. KOUICHIS HOUSE - STAIRCASE  NIGHT  

  Asakawa stands at the foot of the staircase, telephone RECEIVER in 
  hand.  The phone rests on a small STAND by the staircase.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		Yeah.  Your Oshima contact came 
		through.  It looks like the woman 
		who predicted the Mihara eruption 
		is the same woman from the video.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  NIGHT

  Ryuji is crouched in front of the TV, REMOTE in hand.  The screen is 
  paused on the scene of the woman brushing her long hair.

				RYUJI
		Her name is Yamamura Shizuko.  She 
		committed suicide forty years ago 
		by throwing herself into Mt. Mihara.

  INT. KOUJIS HOUSE  STAIRCASE - NIGHT  

				ASAKAWA
		Have you got anything else?

				RYUJI (O.S.) 
		Im gonna have to check it for 
		myself.  Ill be leaving for 
		Oshima tomorrow morning.

				ASAKAWA
		Oshima?  Ive only got three days 
		left!

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		I know.  And Ive got four.

  Short silence.

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		Ill be in touch.

  Ryuji hangs up.  Asakawa, deep in thought, slowly places the phone 
  back in its CRADLE.  She turns around to walk back down the hallway 
  only to find her father standing there, face full of concern.

				KOUJI
		Whats happened?

  Asakawa shakes her head.

				ASAKAWA
		Nothing.  I just had some things 
		left over from work.

  She walks past her father, who glances worriedly after her over his 
  shoulder.

  INT. KOUJIS HOUSE - GUEST ROOM  NIGHT

  The lights are all off and Asakawa is asleep in her futon.  Her eyes 
  suddenly fly open as a VOICE sounding eerily like her deceased niece 
  Tomoko calls out to her.


				TOMOKO (O.S.) 
		Auntie?

  Asakawa looks around the room, gets her bearings.  Her eyes fall on 
  the futon next to hers.

				ASAKAWA
		Yoichi?

  There is a BODY in that futon, but it is full-grown, dressed all in 
  black.  It is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned 
  away.

  Suddenly, the IMAGE from the video of the figure with its face 
  shrouded springs to Asakawas mind.  Just an instant, its pointing 
  visage materializes, and then disappears.  It reappears a moment 
  later, pointing more insistently now, and disappears again.  

  Asakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is 
  empty.  Yoichi is nowhere to be seen.

  Just then, she hears that high-pitched, metallic SQUEAKING from the 
  video.  Eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart--
  --and there, seated before the television, is Yoichi.

  He is watching the video.

  It is already at the very last scene, the shot of the outdoor well. 
  CLOSEUP on the screen now, and for just an instant we can see that 
  something is trying to claw its way out of the well.  The video cuts 
  off, and the screen fills with static.  

  Shrieking, Asakawa races over to Yoichi, covers his eyes though it is 
  already too late.  She scoots over to the VCR, ejects the tape and 
  stares at it uncomprehendingly.  She is then at Yoichis side again, 
  shaking him roughly.

				ASAKAWA
		Yoichi!  You brought this with you, 
		didnt you?  Why?!?

				YOICHI	
		Tomo-chan...

  Asakawa freezes, her eyes wide.

				YOICHI	
		Tomo-chan told me to watch it.

  EXT. OCEAN  DAY
  
  WAVES are being kicked up by a large PASSENGER SHIP as it speeds on 
  its way.  CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji standing on deck, looking out over 
  the waves.

				RYUJI	
		I shouldve been more careful.  
		When I was at your place that 
		day, I could feel something 
		there.  I thought it was just 
		because of the video... 

				ASAKAWA	
		You mean that Tomoko

				RYUJI		
		Thats not Tomoko.  Not anymore.



				ASAKAWA	
		Yoichi... he can see them too, 
		cant he?

  Ryuji nods his head, lowers it sadly.

				ASAKAWA	
		Its all my fault.  First Tomoko 
		died, then those three others.  It 
		should have stopped there, but it 
		didnt.  Because of me.

				RYUJI	
		I wonder...

  Asakawa turns to Ryuji suddenly.

				ASAKAWA
		How did the rumors about the 
		video even start in the first 
		place?


				RYUJI	
		This kind of thing... it doesnt 
		start by one person telling a 
		story.  Its more like everyones 
		fear just takes on a life of its 
		own.

				ASAKAWA	
		Fear...

				RYUJI
		Or maybe its not fear at all.  
		Maybe its what we were 
		secretly hoping for all along.

  EXT. PORT  DAY  

  The ship has docked, its GANGPLANK extended.  Ryuji and Asakawa walk 
  the length of the gangplank towards the shore.  A man named MR. 
  HAYATSU is already waiting for them.  He holds up a white SIGNBOARD 
  in both hands.
 
				ASAKAWA	
		Mr. Hayatsu?

				HAYATSU	
		Aah, welcome!  You must be tired 
		after your long trip.  Please, 
		this way.

  Mr. Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to an awaiting minivan.

  Caption-- September 18th.  Saturday.

  INT. HAYATSUS MINIVAN - DAY  

  Ryuji and Asakawa sit in the back.  Mr. Hayatsu is behind the wheel, 
  chattering away.

				HAYATSU	
		Back in the old days, the Yamamuras
		used to head fishing boats out in 
		Sashikiji, though they dont much 
		anymore.  You know, one of Shizukos 
		cousins is still alive. Hes just an 
		old man now.  His son and his 
		daughter-in-law run an old-fashioned 
		inn.  I went ahead and booked 
		reservations for yall, hope thats 
		alright...

  Asakawa gives the briefest of nods in reply, after which the 
  minivan lapses into silence.  Asakawa looks dreamily out at the 
  mountain-studded landscape, then suddenly snaps to.

				ASAKAWA
			(to Ryuji) 
		Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit 
		suicide?

				RYUJI	
		She was taking a real beating 
		in the press, being called a 
		fraud and all sorts of names.  
		After a while she just lost it. 

  CUT to a scene of the minivan speeding along a country road.

  INT. HAYATSUS MINIVAN  DAY 

				RYUJI
		Shizuko was getting a lot of 
		attention around the island after
		predicting the eruption of Mt. 
		Mihara.  Seems that for some time 
		shed had a rather unique ability:
		precognition. It was around then
		that she attracted the attention 
		of a certain scholar whom you may 
		have heard of; Ikuma Heihachiro.   

				ASAKAWA
		He was driven out of the university, 
		wasnt he?

  Ryuji nods.

				RYUJI
		This Professor Ikuma convinces 
		Shizuko to go to Tokyo with him, 
		where he uses her in a series of 
		demonstrations meant to prove the 
		existence of ESP.  At first shes 
		the darling of the press, but the 
		next thing you know theyre 
		knocking her down, calling her a 
		fraud.  Hmph.  Forty years later,
		the media still hasnt changed that
		much.

  Asakawa continues, ignoring Ryujis barb.

				ASAKAWA
		Ive heard this story.  But... Im 
		sure I remember hearing that somebody 
		died at one of those demonstrations.

  A strange look crosses Ryujis face.  He looks away, ignores her 
  for a moment.

				RYUJI
		After getting kicked out of 
		university, Ikuma just vanished, 
		and no ones been able to get hold 
		of him since.  Hes probably not 
		even alive anymore.

				ASAKAWA
		But, why even try looking for him?

				RYUJI
		Because hes supposed to have had a 
		child with Shizuko.  A daughter.

  Asakawa freezes.  In her mind, she sees a small FIGURE dressed in 
  white, its face hidden by long, black HAIR.  It is the figure from 
  the video.

  EXT. OUTSIDE YAMAMURA VILLA - DAY  

  Mr. Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to the entrance.

				HAYATSU	
		Hello?

  The INKEEPER, a middle-aged lady named KAZUE wearing a traditional 
  KIMONO, comes shuffling up.  She addresses Mr. Hayatsu.

				KAZUE	
		Thank you.

  She turns to Asakawa and Ryuji.

				KAZUE (contd)
		Welcome.

				HAYATSU
		Well, Ill be off then.

  He gives a little bow and is off.  Kazue, meanwhile, has produced 
  two pairs of SLIPPERS, which she offers to Ryuji and Asakawa.

				KAZUE
		Please.

  Ryuji and Asakawa begin removing their shoes. 

  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA  STAIRCASE - DAY  

  Kazue leads Ryuji and Asakawa up a shadowed, wooden STAIRCASE.

				KAZUE
		And for your rooms, how shall we...? 

				RYUJI
		Separate, please.

				KAZUE
		Sir.

  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA - 2ND FLOOR  DAY

  Kazue gives a little bow.

				KAZUE
		This way.

  Kazue turns to the right.  Almost immediately after reaching the 
  top of the steps, however, a strange look crosses Ryujis face.  
  He heads down the opposite end of the corridor, Asakawa close 
  behind.

				KAZUE
			(alarmed) 
		Sir!

  Ryuji flings open the SLIDING DOOR to one of the older rooms.  There, 
  hanging from one of the walls, is the oval-shaped MIRROR from the 
  video, the one used by the mysterious lady to brush her long hair.  
  Ryuji stares at the mirror, almost wincing.  He turns around as if 
  to look at Asakawa,but continues turning, looks past her.  Asakawa 
  follows his gaze, as does Kazue.  Standing at the end of the corridor 
  is an old man, MR. YAMAMURA. 

  Yamamura regards them silently, balefully.  Breaking the silence, 
  Kazue gestures for Asakawa and Ryuji to follow.

				KAZUE
			(softly) 
		Please, this way.

  Asakawa races past the innkeeper towards the old man.  He keeps his 
  back turned towards her.

				ASAKAWA
		Please!  If you could just answer 
		a few questions, about Shizuko...

				YAMAMURA
		I got nuthin to say.

				ASAKAWA
		Its about Shizukos daughter.

  The old man says nothing.

				ASAKAWA
		She did have a daughter, didnt she?

  Yamamura regards her for a moment, then turns to walk away.

				YAMAMURA	
  		Youre wasting your time.

  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA - DINING ROOM  NIGHT

  The TABLE is laid out with an elaborate-looking DINNER.  Asakawa 
  sits alone, knees curled up to her chin, eyes wide and frightened.  
  She is whimpering softly to herself.  Just then, the DOOR slides 
  open and Ryuji walks in.  He sits at the table and picks up a 
  pair of CHOPSTICKS.

				RYUJI		
		Arent you gonna eat?

				ASAKAWA	
		Umm...

				RYUJI		
		Hm?

				ASAKAWA	
		Youll stay with me wont you?  
		When its time for me to die.

				RYUJI		
		Oh, stop it.

  Asakawa scoots across the tatami mats towards the table, grabs 
  Ryuji fiercely by the arm.

				ASAKAWA
		Youll stay, wont you?  If you 
		stayed, maybe youd learn something
		that could help Yoichi--

				RYUJI
		I said stop it!  Have you forgotten 
		There was a girl with Tomoko when 
		she died?  That girls now in a 
		mental institution.  Who knows what 
		could happen. 

				ASAKAWA	
		But you could stay with me, Ryuji.  
		Youd be OK.


				RYUJI
			(angrily)
		Why, because Im already not 
		right in the head?

  Asakawa releases her hold on Ryujis arm, lowers her head.  Ryuji 
  slams his chopsticks down angrily.

				RYUJI	
		If thats the case, why not just
		let things run its course, get rid
		of father -and- son?  Yoichi was a
		mistake, anyway.

				ASAKAWA
		Stop it!

  Short silence.  When Ryuji speaks up again, his voice is soft, 
  reassuring.

				RYUJI	
		We still have two days left...

  Just then the VOICE of the innkeeper calls tentatively out from 
  the other side of the sliding door.

				KAZUE (O.S.) 
		Excuse me?

				RYUJI	
		Come in.

  Kazue slides the door open.  She stands hesitantly in the doorway, 
  something tucked under one arm.


				KAZUE	
		Its about Miss Shizuko.  

  Ryuji shoots a glance at Asakawa and stands up from the table, 
  walks towards the innkeeper.

				KAZUE	
		This is all that there is...

  Kazue produces an old black and white PHOTOGRAPH.  The photo shows a 
  WOMAN, seated, dressed in a KIMONO.  A MAN in a Western-style SUIT 
  stands beside her.  

				RYUJI	
		Is this Professor Ikuma?

  Hearing this Asakawa leaps up, walks over to examine the picture for 
  herself.

				KAZUE
		...yes.  This picture is from before 
		Id entered the household.  

  She pauses a moment.

				KAZUE (contd)
		I should go now.

  The innkeeper scuttles off, leaving Asakawa and Ryuji alone with the 
  photograph.  Unbidden, the VOICE from the video enters their 
  thoughts.

				VOICE
		Shoumon bakkari... boukon ga kuru zo...


  EXT. IZU SEASHORE - DAY

  Asakawa watches Ryuji stride down the shore.

  Caption-- September 19th.  Monday.

  Ryuji strolls up to find old man Yamamura sitting alone, staring 
  out at the sea.  Yamamura glances up to see Ryuji approaching.  
  Ryuji takes a seat next to the old man, but its Yamamura who speaks 
  first.  The deep basso of his voice emphasizes the drawl of his 
  accent.

				YAMAMURA	
		Yalld do best to be off soon.  
		Seas probably gonna be rough 
		tonight.

				RYUJI		
		What kind of a child was Shizuko?

				YAMAMURA 
		Shizuko was... different.  Shed come 
		out here by herself everday an just
		stare out at the ocean.  The fishermen 
		all took a dislikin to her.  Oceans 
		an unlucky place for us, ysee: every 
		year it swallows up more of our own. 
		You keep starin out at somethin 
		ike that... 

				RYUJI
      		Shoumon bakkari shiteru to, boukon ga 
		kuru zo.  If you keep playing in the 
		water, the monster will come for you.

  Yamamura looks at Ryuji, surprised.  

				RYUJI
		Shizuko could see inside people, 
		couldnt she?  Down to the places 
		theyd most like to keep hidden.  It 
		must have been difficult for her...

  Yamamura rises unsteadily to his feet, features twisted angrily.

				YAMAMURA
 		Please leave!  Now!

  Ryuji stands, takes hold of Yamamuras arm.

				RYUJI
		Ive got a little of that ability 
		myself.  It was you who spread the 
		word about Shizuko, wasnt it?  
		And you who first contacted 
		Professor Ikuma?

				YAMAMURA	
		Whatre you--?

				RYUJI
		You thought youd be able to make 
		some money off her.  You even got 
		some, from one of the newspapers.

				YAMAMURA		
		Leave me the hell alone!

  Mr. Yamamura strides angrily off.  Both Ryuji and Asakawa take 
  pursuit, Ryuji calling out from behind Yamamuras back.


				RYUJI		
		Tell us about Shizukos daughter.  
		Who was she?

				YAMAMURA	
		I dont know!

				RYUJI		
		She was there, with Shizuko. She 
		had to be.

  Yamamuras pace, which has become increasingly erratic, finally 
  causes him to stumble and fall.  Ryuji comes up behind him, 
  grasping him firmly.  At their touch Ryujis power awakens, and as 
  he peers into the old mans mind there is a sudden blinding

  FLASH

  The setting is a large MEETING HALL.  A number of people are seated 
  in folding chairs before a STAGE, on which are a four MEN in BUSINESS 
  SUITS and a WOMAN in a KIMONO.  A BANNER hangs above the stage, which 
  reads PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.  

  FLASH

  Ryuji eyes widen as he realizes he is seeing Shizukos demonstration 
  before the press.  He also realizes--

				RYUJI
			(to Yamamura)
		You were there!

  FLASH

  YAMAMURA SHIZUKO, the woman in the kimono, is sitting at a TABLE 
  onstage. Her face is calm and expressionless.  Standing off to one 
  side and peering from behind the curtains is a young Mr. Yamamura.

				RYUJI	(O.S.) 
		You stood there and watched the 
		demonstration.

  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa comes running up toward Ryuji and the 
  prone Mr. Yamamura.  Suddenly there is another

  FLASH

  Asakawa, her eyes wide, finds herself inside the scene, reliving it 
  as if she had actually been there.  She watches as Shizuko receives 
  a sealed clay POT in both hands.  Shizuko regards the pot a moment 
  and then places it gently on the table before her.  She takes a 
  calligraphy STYLUS from the table, begins writing on a thin, 
  rectangular sheet of RICE PAPER.  The members of the press talk 
  excitedly, craning their necks for a better look.

  Onstage, a JUDGE holds up the phrase written by Shizuko and the 
  folded sheet of paper taken from the sealed pot.  The phrase on both 
  sheets is identical.

				JUDGE		
		Match.

  Cameras begin FLASHING excitedly.  Shizukos features melt into a soft 
  smile. 

  The experiment is performed again, and again the phrase written by 
  Shizuko corresponds to the sealed sheet of paper.

				JUDGE
		Match.

  Again and again, Shizuko unerringly demonstrates her power to see 
  the unseen.  Finally, a bearded REPORTER explodes from his chair, 
  begins striding angrily towards the stage.

				REPORTER	
		Faker!  This is nothing but trickery, 
		and the lowest form of trickery at 
		that. 

  The reporter stops at the foot of the stage, points his finger 
  accusingly at Shizuko.

				REPORTER	
		What are you trying to pull, woman?

  A SECOND REPORTER sitting in the front row also rises to his feet.

				REPORTER #2	
		Thats right!  Professor Ikuma, 
		youre being fooled!

  By now most of the press has risen from their chairs, pointing and 
  shouting angrily. Onstage, Shizuko backs away, eyes wide and 
  frightened.  She covers both ears, trying to block out the increasing 
  din.  Professor Ikuma holds her protectively by the shoulders.  The 
  first reporter is still shouting angrily, his voice rising above the 
  others.  Suddenly, a pained look crosses his face and he collapses to 
  the floor.  The crowd, and Asakawa as well, see that the reporters 
  face is contorted into a grotesque mask of fear.

				REPORTER #3	
		Whats happened?

				REPORTER #4	
		Hes dead!



				REPORTER #5	
			(to Shizuko) 
		Witch!

  Professor Ikuma begins leading Shizuko offstage.  They stop as someone 
  unseen steps up, blocking their passage.  Shizukos eyes widen, her 
  head shaking in disbelief.

				SHIZUKO
		Sadako?  Was it you?

  CUT to Ryuji on the beach.  He looks up excitedly.

				RYUJI		
		Sadako?!

  He recalls the image from the video, the alien eye with the single 
  character SADA reflected in reverse. *


  >* The majority of girls' names in Japanese end in either -mi ("beauty") 
  >or -ko ("child").  Thus, Sadako means "Chaste child."  Sadako is, of 
  >course, the mysterious daughter of Shizuko and Professor Ikuma.


				RYUJI
		Sadako killed him?  She can kill 
		just with a thought?

				YAMAMURA	
		Shes... a devil spawn.

  CUT back to the demonstration hall.  Sadako, her face completely hidden 
  by her long hair, runs offstage... and heads directly for Asakawa.  
  Asakawa instinctively raises her arm, and Sadako grasps it fiercely.  
  All the nails on Sadako hand are stripped away; her fingers are raw, 
  bloody stumps.

  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa, still caught in the throes of the 
  vision, has begun to swoon.  Finally her legs give out and she crumples 
  to the beach.  Ryuji grabs hold of her supportively.  He glances down at 
  her wrist, sees an ugly, purple BRUISE already beginning to form.  

  The bruise is in the shape of five long, spindly fingers.

  Mr. Yamamura slowly rises to a sitting position, and together the three 
  watch the approach of ominous, dark STORM CLOUDS.

  INT. MR. HAYATSUS HOUSE  DUSK

  Asakawa is on the phone, her voice almost frantic.

				ASAKAWA
		Thats right. After Yamamura Shizuko 
		committed suicide, Professor Ikuma
		took the daughter and ran.  No, no one
		knows where they went.  Thats why I 
		need -you- to find out where they are.  
		Even if the professors dead, Sadako 
		should still be in her forties.  Ill 
		explain it all later, but right now 
		just hurry!

  Asakawa slams the phone down.  PAN to show Ryuji slumped in one corner 
  of the room, his back to the wall.

				RYUJI	
		Sadakos probably already dead.  She
		could kill people with just a thought, 
		remember?  Her mother wasnt even 
		close to that.


				ASAKAWA	
			(flustered) 
		Well, what about that video?  If 
		Sadakos dead then who made it?

				RYUJI	
		Nobody made it. It wasnt made at 
		all. That video... is the pure, 
		physical manifestation of Sadakos 
		hatred.

  Ryuji turns to regard Asakawa, his eyes blank.

				RYUJI
		Weve been cursed.

  There is a moment of silence before Mr. Hayatsu slides the door open, 
  almost falling into the room.  He is out of breath, and speaks rapidly.

				HAYATSU	
		Its no good.  With the typhoon 
		coming in, all ships are 
		temporarily staying docked.

				RYUJI	
		What about the fishing boats?  
		Tell their captains Ill pay.

				HAYATSU
		Fishing boats?  Sir, without knowing 
		whether this typhoon is going to hit 
		us or not, I think itd be better to 
		wait and see how things turn--

  Ryuji interrupts him, slamming both palms on the table.  Glasses 
  rattle wildly.

				RYUJI	
		Fine!  Ill try searching myself!

  Ryuji stands and races past Mr. Hayatsu out into the rain.  Hayatsu 
  takes pursuit, calling after him.

				HAYATSU	
		Mr. Takayama!?  Mr. Takayama...

  Asakawa, left alone, stares down at the tatami mats.

  EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT  

  White-capped waves roll angrily in a black sea.

  INT. MR. HAYATSUS HOUSE  NIGHT

  Asakawa sits at a table, alone, her hands clasped as if in prayer.  Her 
  eyes are wide and glassy.  The phone RINGS suddenly and Asakawa dives 
  for it, wrenching it from the cradle before it can ring a second time.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				OKAZAKI (O.S.) 
		Mrs. Asakawa?  Im sorry.  I tried, 
		but I couldnt come up with any 
		leads at all.

  A look of abject fear crosses Asakawas face.  She begins retreating 
  into herself.


				OKAZAKI (O.S.) 
		Hello?

				ASAKAWA
			(softly) 
		Thank you...

  Asakawa slowly places the phone back in its cradle.  Almost immediately, 
  her face begins to crumple.  She falls to her knees, sobbing into the 
  floor.

				ASAKAWA	
		Yoichi...

  She cries a while longer but suddenly stops.  Her face, eyes streaked 
  with tears, shoots suddenly up, stares directly at the telephone.

				ASAKAWA	 
			(softly) 
		Izu...

  EXT. IZU WHARF  NIGHT

  Asakawa stands looking down on the wharf, scanning. 

  Several FISHING BOATS are docked.  The wind whips her hair crazily 
  around.   She continues scanning, and suddenly she spies--

				ASAKAWA	
			(calling) 
		Ryuji!

  Asakawa runs down onto the wharf, heading towards Ryuji.  He is 
  in mid-conversation with Mr. Hayatsu.

				ASAKAWA	
		Ryuji!  The phone in my apartment 
		never rang!  It only ever rang at
		the rental cottage!  Professor 
		Ikuma mustve...

				RYUJI	
		And weve got no way of going back.

				HAYATSU	
		Its too dangerous!  The thought of 
		anybody going out in this weather...

  The three fall into silence as they realize the powerlessness of their 
  situation.  Suddenly, a deep VOICE booms from behind them.

				YAMAMURA (O.S.) 
		Ill take you out.

  The three spin around to see Mr. Yamamura, his ROBES flapping in the 
  gusty night air. He begins walking towards them.

				YAMAMURA	
		Sadako is callin yall, reckon.  
		Mayhap to drag you down under the 
		water.

  Short silence.  Ryuji shoots a short questioning glance at Asakawa, 
  turns back to face Mr. Yamamura.

				RYUJI	
		Please.  Take us out.



  EXT. OCEAN  NIGHT

  A tiny FISHING BOAT is tossed about on the waves.  Mr. Yamamura stands 
  at the wheel, his face expressionless.

  INT. MR. YAMAMURAS FISHING BOAT  NIGHT

  Ryuji and Asakawa are crouched close together in the cabin.  Asakawas 
  expression is dreamy, faraway.

				ASAKAWA
		Its funny.  Im not afraid at all.  

  Ryuji leans over, rubs her hand comfortingly.  Suddenly he switches 
  back into analytical mode.

				RYUJI	
		Sadako probably died back out there
		at Izu, before the rental cottages 
		were ever built.

				ASAKAWA	
		So, Sadako was Professor Ikumas 
		daughter?

				RYUJI
			(nodding) 
		Ikuma smuggled her out in secret.  
		His relationship with Shizuko was 
		already a scandal, and one of the 
		reasons he got drummed out of the 
		university... Weve gotta find 
		Sadakos body.



				ASAKAWA
			(excitedly) 
		Is that going to break the curse?  
		Will Yoichi be all right?

				RYUJI	
		Its all weve got left to try.

				ASAKAWA	
		Just one more day...

  Ryuji puts his arm around Asakawa.

  EXT. MR. YAMAMURAS FISHING BOAT - DAWN  

  Ryuji stands on deck, looking out over the water.  He heads down 
  below toward the captains area.  Mr. Yamamura is at the wheel.

				RYUJI	
		We made it.  Maybe Sadako doesnt 
		have it out for us after all.

  Long pause as Mr. Yamamura says nothing.

				YAMAMURA
		Shizuko... she used to -speak- to 
		the ocean, just ramble away.  One 
		time I hid, listenin to one of her 
		conversations.

  Mr. Yamamura pauses again.

				YAMAMURA (contd)	
		And it werent in no human language.


  EXT. MR. YAMAMURAS FISHING BOAT  DAWN

  Asakawa has climbed out on deck and is looking up towards the sunrise.

  Caption-- September 20th.  Monday.

  EXT. HARDWARE STORE  DAY

  Ryuji races out of the store, loaded down with supplies.  He holds a 
  pair of BUCKETS in one hand and a CROWBAR and SHOVEL in the other.  A 
  length of ROPE is coiled over his left shoulder.  He runs towards a 
  RENTAL CAR, passing by Asakawa who stands at a PAYPHONE, receiver in 
  hand.

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Hello?

				ASAKAWA	
		Yoichi?  Its mommy.  I just called 
		to say Ill be coming home tomorrow.

  Ryuji shoots a look at her over his shoulder.

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Im tired of it here, mom!  I wanna
		go back to school.

				ASAKAWA
			(smiling) 
		Yoichi, its rude to your grandpa 
		to talk like that.

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Hes laughing.  You wanna talk to him?

				ASAKAWA	
		No, thats...

  Asakawa pauses, her voice hitching.  She seems about to lose 
  her composure.

				ASAKAWA	
		Im sorry, Yoichi.  Ill... Ill 
		see you tomorrow.  

				YOICHI (O.S.)	
		Whats wrong?

  Asakawas face scrunches up in an effort to hold back tears.

				ASAKAWA	
		Mommys got something she has to do.  
		Say hello to grandpa for me, OK?

  Ryuji stands by the car, scowling over at Asakawa.  He shuts the DOOR 
  just short of a slam.  CUT to Asakawa hanging up the phone.  She half-
  runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side, staring 
  blankly into space.  Ryuji slides into the drivers seat, buckles his 
  SEATBELT.  

				RYUJI		
		What time was it when you first 
		watched the video?

  Asakawa glances at her watch.

				ASAKAWA	
		Seven or eight minutes past 
		seven.  PM.  No more than ten 
		minutes past.
 		
				RYUJI
		If the rumors are true, that 
		time is gonna be our deadline.

  Asakawa buckles up as Ryuji steps on the gas.

  INT. RENTAL CAR  DAY

  Asakawa sits in the passenger side.  Her face is almost angelic, 
  with the faintest hint of a smile.  Ryuji shoots a questioning look 
  at her.

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

  The white rental car tears past the SIGN reading Izu Pacific Land.  
  The car continues into the LOT, screeching around corners before 
  coming to an abrupt halt.  Asakawa, her face still oddly expressionless, 
  gets out of the passenger side.  Ryuji exits as well, the hint of a 
  shudder running through him as he regards the series of rental cabins.

				RYUJI		
		-Here-.

  CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji walking up the gravel PATH towards the rental 
  cabins.  Ryuji looks back over his shoulder as both he and Asakawa stop 
  before cabin B4.  The cabin is on STILTS, its underbelly fenced off by 
  wooden LATICEWORK.  Ryuji drops most of his supplies to the ground, but 
  keeps hold of the PICK.  He raises the pick over one shoulder and begins 
  smashing away at the latticework.  When he has cleared enough space for   
  passage, he begins picking up supplies and tossing them hastily within.  
  When finished, he holds a hand out for Asakawa.  The two enter the 
  earthen basement.


  UNDER COTTAGE B4 - DAY  

  Ryuji pulls a FLASHLIGHT out, flicks it on.  The BEAM arcs outwards, 
  illuminating what looks more like an old mine shaft than a modern 
  rental cottage.  The beam halts when it suddenly encounters an old 
  STONE WELL.  The well is badly chipped on one side, and sealed off 
  with a solid-looking stone LID.  Ryuji rushes quickly towards it.

				RYUJI
		I knew it!  The well.

  He squats down beside the well, setting the flashlight on the 
  lid.  Asakawa sinks slowly down beside him.

				ASAKAWA
		The well...

  Ryuji reaches out and takes Asakawas hand.  He sets their enclasped 
  hands onto the lid, and together they begin lightly tracing the 
  surface of the lid with their free hands.  Asakawa closes her eyes in 
  concentration... and suddenly, as with the incident on the beach, 
  Asakawa finds herself drawn into Ryujis psychometric VISION.

  FLASH

  The picture is black and white, grainy like old film.  A YOUNG GIRL in 
  a WHITE GOWN walks slowly towards an open well. She places her hand on 
  the LIP of the well, peers curiously down.  

  FLASH

  Asakawa looks up, her eyes wide open.

  FLASH
  
  There is now a second person in the vision, an ELDERLY MAN in an old-
  fashioned tweed SUIT standing behind the young girl.  He suddenly 
  produces some BLADED OBJECT, and strikes the girl savagely across the 
  back of the head.  

  The girl falls forward. The man drops to the ground, grabbing the girl 
  behind the knees and hoisting her limp BODY over the lip and into the 
  well.  The body falls into its depths.

  Panting heavily, the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well 
  with both hands, looking down.  He flashes a guilty look in either 
  direction, checking that his crime has gone unnoticed, and as he does 
  so Asakawa realizes that she knows this face.  The image from the 
  videotape, like a face in the moon: it had been Sadako inside the well, 
  looking up to see this man staring back down at her.

  This man whose name is Professor Ikuma Heihachiro.

  FLASH

				ASAKAWA
		Her own father!

  The energy seems to drain out of Asakawa in a rush, and her body 
  crumbles.  Ryuji catches hold of her.

				RYUJI		
		It was Ikuma who put this lid on.  
		And Sadakos still inside.

  Ryuji stands quickly, takes hold of the crowbar.  He inserts it under 
  the lid and begins trying to pry it off, face scrunched with effort.  
  Asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well. Slowly,
  the lid begins to move.  Ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two 
  lean the combined weight of their bodies into it.  The lid slides off, 
  dropping to the earth with a dull THUD.  Ryuji sits to one side, winded 
  with effort, as Asakawa takes hold of the flashlight.  She shines it 
  down into the well, but it only seems to intensify the gloom. What 
  WATER she can see looks fetid and brackish.  Ryuji sees her expression 
  and begins removing his JACKET.

				RYUJI
		Ill go.

  He walks off, leaving Asakawa alone.

  CUT to an overhead shot of the well.  A ROPE is fastened to one side, 
  and Ryuji has already begun lowering himself down.  His eyes wander 
  overthe grime-smeared WALLS, and with a shudder he begins to pick out 
  human FINGERNAILS.  Torn loose and spattered with blood, countless 
  fingernails line the sides of the well. 

				RYUJI
 		Sadako was alive!  Shed tried to 
		climb her way out.

  Ryujis face twists into a grimace as if momentarily experiencing 
  Sadakosterrible agony.  He waits a moment longer before edging his 
  way down the rope again, finally SPLASHING to rest at the bottom of 
  the well.  He holds his flashlight above the brackish water, calls up 
  to Asakawa.

				RYUJI
		Lower the buckets!

  Asakawa nods and lowers two plastic BUCKETS fastened to a rope.  Ryuji 
  grabs one and scoops up a bucketful of water, tugging on the rope when 
  finished.

				RYUJI
		Take it up!

  Asakawa hoists the bucket up to the rim of the well.  She walks a small 
  distance and tosses the contents out onto the ground.  She happens to 
  glance through the wooden lattice to the outside, and with a start 
  realizes that the sun has already started to set.  A nervous glance at 
  her WATCH later and she is back at the well, lowering the empty bucket 
  to find another full one already awaiting her.

				RYUJI
		Take it up!

  In the well, Ryuji glances at his watch.  He looks at it for a long 
  moment, the expression on his face saying Were not going to make it.  
  Time passes as Asakawa pulls up bucketload after bucketload, her 
  strength beginning to fade.  She half-stumbles, glances up... and is 
  shocked to realize that NIGHT has fallen.

  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling up yet another bucket, her strength 
  almost gone.  She looks at her watch and sees that it is now past 
  6:00.  She calls frantically down to Ryuji.

				ASAKAWA
		Its already six!

				RYUJI
			(explosively) 
		I know!  Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!

  The bucket slowly jerks into motion.  Asakawa pulls it up to the rim 
  of the well, holds it unsteadily.  She takes one faltering step and 
  falls, spilling the buckets contents onto the ground.  

  CUT to Ryuji in the well, standing ready with another bucketful.


				RYUJI
 		Take it up!

  Nothing happens.  

				RYUJI
		Asakawa!

  The bucket begins moving, even slower than before.  CUT to Asakawa, 
  her body trembling with effort. By now its all she can do to simply 
  keep her body moving.  She glances behind her, sees through the wooden 
  lattice that it is now pitch black.  A look of resignation crosses her 
  face and she releases her hold on the bucket, her body crumpling and 
  falling in on itself. 
  
  CUT to the bucket splashing back into the well, narrowly missing 
  Ryuji.

				RYUJI	
			(fuming) 
		What the hell are you doing?  Trying 
		to get me killed?

  CUT back to Asakawa, her face dead.  Ryuji calls out from the well.

				RYUJI (O.S.) 
		Hey!

  Asakawa falls backward onto the ground, arms splayed. CUT to the rim 
  of the well.  Ryuji pulls himself up over the rim, catches sight of 
  Asakawa.

				RYUJI
		Asakawa!

  She lifts her head up but says nothing as Ryuji walks over to her.

				RYUJI
		Well change.  Youre in no condition 
		to keep this up.

  Asakawa suddenly springs into life.  Her voice is frantic, fearful.

				ASAKAWA:	
		No!

				RYUJI
		Who do you expect to pull up these 
		buckets, then?

				ASAKAWA
		But, we dont even know if its doing 
		any good...

  Ryuji strides forward and slaps Asakawa painfully across the cheek.  
  He begins shaking her roughly for good measure.

				RYUJI
		And what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his
		mother not coming to pick him up 
		after all?

  He releases his hold on her.  The two stare at each other a long time, 
  saying nothing.
 
  CUT to an overhead shot of Asakawa being lowered into the well. CUT 
  now to Asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with 
  grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright.  
  Unable to resist the impulse, Asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder 
  and down into the well.  The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in 
  and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic.

				RYUJI
		Dont look down!

  She returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward.  CUT to Ryuji leaning 
  over the rim of the well, peering down at her.  For an instant, 
  everything becomes monochrome. Its not Ryuji looking down at her at 
  all; its Professor Ikuma, checking to see if shes still alive or 
  if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off.  CUT to 
  Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright.

  Asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well.  A FLASHLIGHT hangs 
  from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness.  
  Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water.  
  She calls out pleadingly.

				ASAKAWA
		Where are you?  Please, come out.

  Asakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope.  A full bucket 
  already awaits.  She tugs on the rope and Ryuji pulls it up.  

  She scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending 
  it up.  Instead, she begins running her arms through the water again, 
  her voice close to tears.

				ASAKAWA
		Please.  Where are you?

  Asakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes 
  of stagnant water.  With a start, she realizes that her fingers have 
  caught something.  Seaweed?  Asakawa draws her hands close for a 
  better look... and sees that is HAIR.  A thick clump of long, black 
  hair.

  Suddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching 
  Asakawa just below the wrist.  Asakawas ears are filled with a SOUND 
  like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.  It 
  is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.  CUT to a 
  shot of Asakawas face.  Far from being frightened, her features are 
  oddly placid.  She regards the fearsome thing before her with an 
  almost tender look.  Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long 
  hair.  

				ASAKAWA
		Its you...

  She strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head 
  with a loud SQUELCH. Revealed is not a face at all but a SKULL.  Its 
  sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the 
  green SLUDGE it has pulled up from the bottom of the well.  Like a 
  mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal 
  remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. Her eyes 
  begin to glaze.

  CUT to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down intently.

				RYUJI
		Hey!  Asakawa!  Its already 10 
		minutes past seven!  We did it!

  Down in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead.  Her body 
  suddenly falls forward, limp.

  EXT. OUTSIDE COTTAGE B4  NIGHT

  Three POLICE CARS are parked outside the rental cottages, crimson 
  headlights flashing.   A few COPS walk by, two of them carrying 
  something off in white PLASTIC BAGS.  CUT to Ryuji and Asakawa 
  sitting on the curb.  Asakawa is staring off at something, a BLANKET 
  draped over her shoulder.  

				ASAKAWA	
		Why would Ikuma have killed her?  
		His own daughter...

				RYUJI
		Maybe she wasnt his daughter at all.  

				ASAKAWA
		What?

				RYUJI
		Maybe her father... wasnt even human.

  The two exchange glances.  Ryujis gaze falls to Asakawas WRIST, 
  which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face.  The ugly 
  bruise where Sadako had grabbed her has disappeared.

				RYUJI
		Its gone...  

  He shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal.

				RYUJI
		Enough, already.  Its over.  Cmon.  
		Ill take you home.

  Ryuji stands, pulls Asakawa to her feet.

  EXT. OUTSIDE ASKAWAS APARTMENT - NIGHT  

  Ryujis white CAR pulls up into the parking lot.  He and Asakawa 
  get out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car. There is 
  a long moment where neither of them says anything.

				RYUJI	
		Get some rest.  

  He flashes her the slightest of grins. 

				RYUJI (contd)
		I still have a thesis to finish. 

  CUT to a shot of Ryuji and Asakawa, the car creating an almost 
  metaphoric distance between them. 

				ASAKAWA
		...thank you.

  Ryuji nods silently by way of reply.  He gets into his car and 
  drives off.  Asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the 
  entrance of her apartment.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  BEDROOM  MORNING

  Asakawa walks into her room, sits on the edge of her bed.  It is 
  now morning, and she sits dazedly watching the sun come up.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  MORNING

  Ryuji sits busily scribbling into a NOTEBOOK.  He stops writing a 
  moment to regard his notes while taking a sip of COFFEE.  He 
  glances over at his BLACKBOARD for confirmation when a small scowl 
  crosses his brow.  Its gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly 
  to himself.

				RYUJI
		That girl...

  Ryuji stands, walks over to the blackboard.  He fixes Mais little 
  prank with a single chalk stroke. 

  EXT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  VERANDA  MORNING

  Asakawa emerges, taking in the dawn.  At first her face is calm and 
  tranquil... but her features change as the sun almost noticeably 
  darkens and a WIND begins to kick up her hair.  She now looks very 
  anxious.

  Caption-- September 21st.  Tuesday.


  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this 
  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP 
  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.


  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  MORNING

  Ryuji is busy scribbling away at his notes again.  His hand suddenly 
  ceases, eyes dancing worriedly as he hears a faint...

  No.

  Breath rattling fearfully in his throat, Ryuji spins around to face 
  the TELEVISION SET.  He gets out of his seat for a better look, 
  falling to his knees on the tatami. 

  The image that fills the screen is the last scene from the videotape; 
  the shot of the well.  

  The SOUND from before comes louder now, more insistent, a metallic 
  screeching that both repulses and beckons him closer. Ryuji crawls on 
  all fours towards the SCREEN, stares at its unchanging image with 
  terrible foreboding.

  There is a flash of MOTION as something shoots out of the well. A 
  hand. First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy white 
  dress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly 
  pulling herself out.  The television screen jumps unsteadily, fills 
  with static as if barely able to contain her image.  

  CUT back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, 
  and the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer.

				RYUJI
			(almost frantic) 
		Why?!

  The TELEPHONE rings, and Ryuji spins round towards it, breath catching 
  in his throat.  He looks at the phone, over his shoulder at the 
  television, back to the phone.

				RYUJI
		Thats it!  Asakawa...

  Ryuji scrambles wildly towards the phone.  He takes the receiver but 
  is unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn 
  inexorably back to the television.  Sadakos shrouded face has filled 
  the entire screen... and then, television popping and crackling, she 
  jerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of 
  Ryujis apartment.  Ryuji backs away, screaming in terror.

				RYUJI
		Aaargh!

  Sadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned corpse.  
  Only her FINGERS are active, crawling, feeling.  The TIPS of her 
  fingers are little more than bloodied stumps, not a single fingernail 
  on them.  She uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself 
  forward, coming jerkily to her feet.  The joints of her body twist 
  unnaturally, more insect-like than human.

  Ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment 
  as if looking for cover.  The strength has already begun to fade from 
  his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated. He falls 
  to the floor, panting heavily.  

  Sadako turns to regard him, and for just an instant we can see beneath 
  her impenetrable shroud of hair; a single EYE burns with manic, 
  unbridled hatred.   

  Its gaze meets Ryujis, and his face twists into a grimace as he 
  SCREAMS loudly.

  FLASH

  EXT. KOUJIS HOUSE - FRONT YARD  DAY

  Yoichi sits on the lawn, doodling into a large SKETCHPAD.  He 
  suddenly stops, eyes registering that he has somehow felt his fathers 
  death.
  
  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  DAY

  Asakawa clutches the RECEIVER to her ear.  She can still hear the 
  sounds of metallic SCREECHING coming from the video, though they are 
  now becoming softer.

  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT BUILDING  DAY

  Asakawa comes running down a side street, turning the corner and 
  making for the entrance to Ryujis apartment building.  There is a 
  single GUARD posted at the entrance. He reaches out, catches Asakawa 
  lightly by the arm.


				GUARD
		Are you a resident here, maam?

				ASAKAWA
		Im Takayama Ryujis wife!

  The guard drops his hand, and Asakawa makes for the entrance.

				GUARD
		Im sorry maam, but theyve already 
		taken the body away.

  Asakawas spins around, eyes wide.  Body?

  INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT  DAY

  Mai is there, slumped against one wall. Asakawa comes running up, 
  dropping to her knees and grasping Mai by the shoulders.

				ASAKAWA
		What happened?

  Mai shakes her head dreamily.

				MAI
		When I got here he was just 
		lying there...

				ASAKAWA	
		Did he say anything to you?  About 
		a videotape?

  Mai shakes her head again, shakes it harder until the breath 
  catches in her throat.


				MAI
		His face...

  Mai falls into silence, curls up on herself.  Asakawa leaves her 
  and crosses toward the door to Ryujis apartment.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT - DAY  

  The front DOOR opens wildly, noisily forward.  Asakawa comes 
  rushing in, eyes darting about the apartment.  She thinks 
  frantically to herself.

				ASAKAWA (VO)
		Ryuji... why?  Does this mean that
		Yoichi will die, too?  Is the curse 
		not broken yet?

  Her gaze falls to the television set.  She dives forward, presses 
  the eject button on the VCR.  Sure enough, the TAPE is still in 
  the deck.  She takes the tape and leaves.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

  Asakawa walks slowly, dreamily forward.  She drops the videotape 
  loudly onto the coffee table and slouches into a CHAIR.  Her eyes 
  fall to the framed photographs of Yoichi on one of the shelves.  
  This snaps Asakawa out of her daze and she begins whispering 
  intently to herself, thinking.

				ASAKAWA
		I was the only one to break 
		Sadakos curse.  Ryuji... why...?  
		Something I did that you didnt...  
		Something I did that you didnt...  

  Asakawa gives up, lowers her face into her hands.  When she looks 
  up again, she happens to glance at the television screen-- and 
  its GLARE reveals that there is someone ELSE in the room with her.  
  It is the figure from the videotape, the silent accuser with the 
  cloth draped over its face.  With a start, Asakawa realizes that 
  the figure is wearing Ryujis clothes.

				ASAKAWA
		Ryuji?!

  She spins around, but the room is empty.  Asakawas mind races.  
  The figure had been pointing towards her BAG.  She stands, 
  rummages in her bag to produce her copy of the cursed videotape.  
  She takes Ryujis COPY in her other hand, her eyes darting 
  between the two tapes.

				ASAKAWA
		Something I did that you didnt...

  It suddenly clicks home as Asakawa looks full-on at Ryujis 
  version of the tape, plainly marked COPY.

				ASAKAWA
		What broke the curse was that I copied 
		the tape and showed it to someone else!

  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling her VCR from the television stand.  
  A look of almost frightening resolve etches her face.

  EXT. HIGHWAY  DAY

  ARIAL SHOT of Asakawas car.  We hear her VOICE on the cell 
  phone.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.)
  		Dad?  Its me.  Im on my way over.
  		Look, dad, Ive got something to ask. 
		Its for Yoichi...

  INT. ASAKAWAS CAR  DAY

  CLOSEUP on the VCR in the passenger side.  CUT to Asakawa at the 
  wheel as time spirals forward, the decisions of the present 
  already become rumor of the future.

				GIRL A (VO) 
		They say theres a way you can stay 
		alive after you watch the video.  
		Youve gotta make a copy of it, and 
		show it to somebody else inside a week.

				GIRL B (VO) 
		But what about the person you show it 
		to?

				GIRL A (VO) 
		Well, then they make a copy and show it 
		to somebody else.  Again, inside a week.

				GIRL C (VO) 
			(laughing)
		Then theres no end to it.

				GIRL A (VO) 
		Thats just it.  There -is- no end.  But 
		if it meant not dying... youd do it, 
		wouldnt you?

  Asakawas eyes begin to well.  Her car speeds along the highway, 
  to the direction of menacing-looking STORM CLOUDS.

  Caption-- September 5th.  Sunday.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  TOMOKOS ROOM - NIGHT

  CLOSEUP on a TELEVISION SET.  Theres a baseball game on, but the sound 
  is turned completely down.  Camera PANS to show two cute high school 
  girls, MASAMI and TOMOKO.  Masami is seated on the floor at a low coffee 
  table, TEXTBOOK in front of her. Tomoko is at her desk.  There are SNACKS 
  all over the room, and its obvious there hasnt been much studying going 
  on. Masami is currently in mid-story, speaking excitedly.

				MASAMI
		They say that some elementary school 
		kid spent the night with his parents 
		at a bed and breakfast in Izu.  The kid
		wanted to go out and play with everybody, 
		right, but he didnt want to miss the 
		program he always used to watch back in 
		Tokyo, so he records it on the VCR in 
		their room.  But of course the stations 
		in Izu are different from the ones in 
		Tokyo.  In Izu, it was just an empty 
		channel, so he shouldve recorded
		nothing but static.  But when the kid 
		gets back to his house and watches the 
		tape, all of a sudden this woman comes 
		on the screen and says--

  Masami points so suddenly and dramatically at her friend that Tomoko 
  actually jumps in her seat.

				MASAMI (contd)
		One week from now, you will die.

  Short silence as Masami pauses, relishing the moment.

				MASAMI (contd)	
		Of course the kids completely 
		freaked, and he stops the video.  
		Just then the phone rings, and when he 
		picks it up a voice says--

  Her voice drops voice almost to a whisper.

				MASAMI (contd)	
		You watched it, didnt you?  That 
		same time, exactly one week later... 
		hes dead!

  Masami laughs loudly, thoroughly enjoying her own performance.  
  Tomoko, however, is completely silent.  She begins looking more 
  and more distressed, until finally Masami notices.

				MASAMI
		What is it, Tomoko?

  Tomoko comes out of her chair and drops onto the floor next to her 
  friend.  Her words are quick, earnest.

				TOMOKO
		Who did you hear that story from?

				MASAMI
		Who?  Its just a rumor.  Everybody 
		knows it.

				TOMOKO
		Youko told you?	

				MASAMI	
		No, it wasnt Youko...

  Tomoko looks away, worried.  Masami slaps her on the knee, 
  laughing.

				MASAMI
		Whats up with you?

  Tomoko speaks slowly, still looking away.

				TOMOKO
		The other day, I... I watched this 
		strange video.
		
				MASAMI
		Where?

				TOMOKO	
		With Youko and them.

				MASAMI	
			(excited) 
		So thats what Ive been hearing 
		about you doing some double-date/
		sleepover thing!  So, you and that 
		guy Iwata, huh? 

				TOMOKO	
		No, its not like that.  Nothing 
		happened!

  Their eyes meet and Tomoko half-blushes, looks away again.  Her 
  expression becomes serious as she resumes her conversation.

				TOMOKO
		Iwata... he found this weird video.  
		Everyone was like, Whats that? so 
		he put it on and we all watched it.

				MASAMI
			(quietly) 
		And?  What kind of video was it?

				TOMOKO
		Just... weird, I cant really explain 
		it.  Anyway, right after we finished 
		watching it, the phone rang.  Whoever
		it was didnt say anything, but still...

  Silence.  Masami curls up on herself, thoroughly spooked.  

				MASAMI	
		Jesus.

				TOMOKO
  		It's cuz, you know, we'd all heard the 
		rumors.

Tomoko looks seriously over at her friend.

				TOMOKO (cont'd)
		That was one week ago today.

  There is a long, heavy silence as neither of them says anything.

				MASAMI  	
		Waaait a minute.  Are you faking me 
		out?

  Tomokos face suddenly breaks into a smile. 

				TOMOKO	
		Busted, huh?

  They both crack up laughing. 

				MASAMI
		Oh, my... I cant believe you!  

  Masami reaches out, slaps her friend on the knee.

				MASAMI (contd)
		Youre terrible!

				TOMOKO
		Gotcha!

				MASAMI	
			(thinking) 
		But hang on... you really stayed
		the night with Youko and Iwata, 
		right?

  Tomoko nods, uh-huh.  Masami dives forward, pinching her friends 
  cheeks and grinning wildly.

				MASAMI	
		So, how far did you and he get?

				TOMOKO 	
		Oh... I cant remember.

				MASAMI	
		You cant remember, huh?

  Masami laughs, then slaps Tomoko on the knee again as she remembers 
  the trick her friend played on her.

				MASAMI	
		Man, you had me freaked me out. 
		I--

  Just at that moment, the phone RINGS.  They are both suddenly, 
  instantly serious.  Tomokos eyes go off in one direction and she 
  begins shaking her head, -No-.  Masami looks over her shoulder, 
  following her friends gaze.  

  Tomoko is looking at the CLOCK, which currently reads 9:40.

  The phone continues to ring.  Tomoko is now clutching tightly onto her 
  friend, looking panicked.

				MASAMI
			(softly) 
		Was it true?

  Tomoko nods her head, still holding on tightly.  Masami has to 
  forcibly disengage herself in order to stand.  The phone is downstairs, 
  so Masami opens the bedroom DOOR and races down the STAIRS.  Tomoko 
  calls out to her from behind.

				TOMOKO
		Masami!

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  STAIRCASE - NIGHT  

  Tomoko and Masami run down the staircase, through the hallway towards 
  the kitchen.  Tomoko cries out again just before they reach the kitchen.

				TOMOKO	
		Masami!

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  

  Masami has come to a halt before a PHONE mounted on the wall.  She 
  pauses, looking slowly at her friend, then back to the phone.  She 
  takes it tentatively from its cradle, answers it wordlessly.  The 
  tension continues to mount as nothing is said. Masami suddenly breaks 
  into a huge grin.

				MASAMI	
		Ill put her on.

  Still grinning, she hands the phone to Tomoko.  Tomoko snatches it 
  quickly.

				TOMOKO
			(softly) 
		Yes?

  She is silent for a moment, then smiling widely.  

				TOMOKO
		Oh, man!

  She is so relieved that all the strength seeps out of her and she 
  sinks to the kitchen floor.  Masami, equally relieved, slides down 
  the wall and sits down next to her.

				TOMOKO
			(on the phone) 
		Yeah, Ive got a friend over now.  
		Yeah.  Yeah, OK.  Bye.

  Tomoko stands to place the phone back in its wall cradle, and then 
  squats back down onto the kitchen floor.

				TOMOKO	
		The games gone into overtime, so 
		theyre gonna be a little late. 

  They burst out laughing with relief again, and are soon both 
  clutching their stomachs.

				TOMOKO	
		Jeeezus, my parents...

				MASAMI	
		Oh man, Im tellin everybody about 
		this tomorrow!

  Tomoko shakes her head, -Dont you dare-.

				MASAMI	
		Im gonna use your bathroom.  Dont 
		go anywhere.

				TOMOKO	
		K.

  Masami walks out of the kitchen. Alone now, Tomoko stands and walks 
  toward the SINK, where she takes a GLASS from the DISH RACK.  She 
  then goes to the FRIDGE and sticks her face in, looking for something 
  to drink.  Suddenly there is the SOUND of people clapping and 
  cheering.  Tomoko, startled, peers her head over the refrigerator 
  door to check for the source of the sound.  

  She begins walking slowly, following the sound to the DINING ROOM 
  adjacent the kitchen. 

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DINING ROOM - NIGHT  

  The lights are off, and there is no one in the room.  Tomoko pauses a 
  moment, bathed in the garish LIGHT from the TV, which has been switched
  on.  Playing is the same baseball game they had on the TV upstairs; the 
  same game that Tomokos parents are currently at.  The VOLUME is up 
  quite high.

  A puzzled look on her face, Tomoko takes the REMOTE from the coffee 
  table and flicks the TV off.  She walks back to the kitchen.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - NIGHT  

  A bottle of SODA that Tomoko had earlier taken from the fridge is on 
  the kitchen table.  She picks the bottle up, pours herself a drink.  
  Before she can take a sip, however, the air around her becomes suddenly 
  charged, heavy.  Her body begins to shiver as somewhere out of sight 
  comes a popping, crackling SOUND underscored by a kind of GROANING.  
  Trembling now, Tomoko spins around to see what she has already felt 
  lurking behind her.  She draws in her breath to scream.

  The screen goes white, and fades into:

  CAMERA POV 

  The screen is filled with the visage of a nervous-looking YOUNG GIRL.  
  She is being interviewed by ASAKAWA, a female reporter seated offscreen.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.)
		There seems to be a popular rumor 
		going around about a cursed 
		videotape.

				YOUNG GIRL	
		Uh-huh.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.) 
		Have you heard what kind of video 
		it might be?

				YOUNG GIRL	
		Uh-huh.

  The girl looks directly at the camera, her mouth dropping into an O 
  as shes suddenly overcome by a kind of stage fright.  She continues 
  staring, silently, at the camera.

  INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY  

  KOMIYA, the cameraman, has lowered his camera. We can now see that 
  the young girl being interviewed is seated at a table between two 
  friends, a SHORT-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL#2) and a LONG-HAIRED GIRL (GIRL #3).  
  They are all dressed in the UNIFORMS of junior high school students.  
  Opposite them sits Komiya and Asakawa, a pretty woman in her mid-
  twenties.  A BOOM MIKE GUY stands to the left.
 
				KOMIYA	
		Uh, dont look right at the camera, 
		OK?

				YOUNG GIRL	
		Sorry.

				ASAKAWA	
		Lets do it again.

  Asakawa glances over her shoulder, makes sure that Komiya is ready.

 
				ASAKAWA
		Have you heard what kind of video 
		it might be?

				YOUNG GIRL
		What I heard was, all of a sudden 
		this scaaarry lady comes on the
		screen and says, In one week, you
		will die.


				GIRL #2	
		I heard that if youre watching TV 
		late at night itll come on, and
		then your phonell ring.

				ASAKAWA
		Watching TV late at night... do you
 		know what station?

				GIRL #2	
		Mmmm... I heard some local station, 
		around Izu.

				ASAKAWA	
		Izu?

				GIRL #2	
		Mmm-hmm.	

				ASAKAWA
		And, do you know if anyones really 
		died from watching it?

  The girl flashes a look at her two friends.

				YOUNG GIRL
		Well, no one that we know, right?

  Girl #2 nods her head. Girl #3 nods slowly, opens and closes her 
  mouth as if deciding whether to say something or not.  The 
  reporter notices. 

				ASAKAWA	
		What is it?


				GIRL #3
		I heard this from a friend of mine 
		in high school.  She said that there 
		was this one girl who watched the 
		video, and then died a week later.  
		She was out on a drive with her 
		boyfriend.

				ASAKAWA
		They were in a wreck?

				GIRL #3
		No, their car was parked, but they 
		were both dead inside.  Her 
		boyfriend died because hed watched 
		the video, too.  Thats what my 
		friend said.

  Girl #3 grows suddenly defensive.

				GIRL #3 (contd)	
		Its true!  It was in the paper two 
		or three days ago.

				ASAKAWA
		Do you know the name of the high 
		school this girl went to?

				GIRL #3
		No... I heard this from my friend, 
		and it didnt happen at her school.  
		She heard it from a friend at a 
		different school, she said.

  INT. NEWS STATION  DAY

  Asakawa is seated at her DESK.  The station is filled with PEOPLE, 
  scrabbling to meet deadlines.  Komiya walks up to Asakawas desk 
  and holds out a MANILA FOLDER.

				KOMIYA	
		Mrs. Asakawa?

				ASAKAWA
		Hm?

				KOMIYA	
		Here you are.

				ASAKAWA
			(taking the folder) 
		Thanks.

  Komiya has a seat.

				KOMIYA	
		This same kind of thing happened 
		about ten years ago too, didnt it?  
		Some popular young singer committed 
		suicide, and then suddenly there was 
		all this talk about her ghost showing
		up on some music show.

				ASAKAWA	
		But I wonder what this rumors all 
		about. Everyone you ask always 
		mentions Izu.

				KOMIYA	
		Maybe thats where it all started.  
		Hey, where was that Kuchi-sake
		Onna * story from again?


  >* Literally Ripped-Mouth Lady, a kind of ghastly spectre from 
  >Japanese folk stories who wears a veil to hide her mouth, which 
  >has been ripped or cut open from ear to ear. She wanders the 
  >countryside at night asking men Do you think Im beautiful? then 
  >lowering her veil to reveal her true features.


				ASAKAWA	
		Gifu, but there was some big 
		accident out there, and that ended
		up being what started the rumor. 

				KOMIYA
		A big accident?

				ASAKAWA	
		Mmm-hmm.  Something terrible like 
		that is going to stay in peoples 
		minds.  Sometimes the story of what 
		happened gets twisted around, and 
		ends up coming back as a rumor like 
		this one. Thats what they say, at 
		least.

				KOMIYA
		Dyou think something like that 
		happened out at Izu?

				ASAKAWA
		Maybe. Well, anyway, Im off.  See you
		tomorrow.
   
				KOMIYA
		See you.

  Asakawa gets up from her desk and begins walking towards the exit.  
  She takes only a few steps before noticing a RACK of recent DAILY 
  EDITIONS.  

  She takes one from the rack, sets it on a nearby TABLE.  She begins 
  flipping the pages, and suddenly spies this story:  

    STRANGE AUTOMOBILE DEATH OF YOUNG COUPLE IN YOKOHAMA

    The bodies of a young man and woman were discovered in their 
    passenger car at around 10 A.M. September 6th.  The location was a 
    vacant lot parallel to Yokohama Prefectural Road.  Local authorities 
    identified the deceased as a 19-year old preparatory school student 
    of Tokyo, and a 16-year old Yokohama resident, a student of a 
    private all-girls high school. Because there were no external 
    injuries, police are investigating the possibility of drug-induced 
    suicide...

  Just then two men walk by, a GUY IN A BUSINESS SUIT and a youngish 
  intern named OKAZAKI.  Okazaki is carrying an armload of VIDEOTAPES.

				GUY IN SUIT
		OK, Okazaki, Im counting on you.

				OKAZAKI	
		Yessir.

  The guy in the suit pats Okazaki on the shoulder and walks off.  

  Okazaki turns to walk away, spots Asakawa bent over the small table 
  and peering intently at the newspaper article.


				OKAZAKI	
		Miss Asakawa?  I thought you were 
		going home early today.

  Asakawa turns around and begins speaking excitedly.

				ASAKAWA
		Okazaki, can I ask you a favor?

				OKAZAKI
		Sure.

  Asakawa points to the newspaper.

				ASAKAWA
		Could you check out this article 
		for me?  Get me some more info.?	

				OKAZAKI
		I guess...

				ASAKAWA	
		Good.  Call me as soon as you know 
		more, OK?

				OKAZAKI	
		Maam.

  Asakawa walks off.  Okazaki, still carrying the videotapes, leans 
  forward to take a look at the article.
   
  EXT. APARTMENT PARKING LOT - DAY  

  Asakawa drives her car into the lot and parks quickly.  She gets 
  out, runs up the STAIRCASE to the third floor.  She stops in front 
  of a door, sticks her KEY in the lock, and opens it.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM  DAY

  A BOY of about 7 is sitting in an ARMCHAIR facing the veranda.  We 
  can see only the back of his head.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.) 
		Yoichi!

  Hearing his name, the boy puts down the BOOK he was reading and 
  stands up, facing the door.  He is wearing a white DRESS SHIRT with 
  a brown sweater-type VEST over it.  He sees Asakawa, his mother, 
  run in the door.  She is panting lightly.

				ASAKAWA
		Sorry Im late.  Oh, youve already 
		changed.

				YOICHI
		Yup. 

  He points over to his mothers right.

				YOICHI (contd)
		I got your clothes out for you.

  Asakawa turns to see a DARK SUIT hanging from one of the living 
  room shelves.  She reaches out, takes it.

				ASAKAWA
		Aargh, weve gotta hurry!

  She runs into the next room to change.

  INT.  BEDROOM  DAY

  Asakawa has changed into all-black FUNERAL ATTIRE.  Her hair is 
  up, and she is fastening the clasp to a pearl NECKLACE.  Yoichi is 
  still in the living room.

				ASAKAWA	
		Did grandpa call?

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Nope.

  Yoichi walks into the room and faces his mother.

				YOICHI	
		Why did Tomo-chan die? *


  >* -chan is a suffix in Japanese that denotes closeness or affection.  
  >It is most often used for young girls, though it can also be used for 
  >boys.


				ASAKAWA	
		Well... it looks like she was really, 
		really sick.

  She takes a seat on the bed.

				ASAKAWA	
		Will you do me up?

  Yoichi fastens the rear button of his mothers dress and zips her up.  

				YOICHI	
		You can die even if youre young?

				ASAKAWA
		If its something serious... well, yes.

  Asakawa turns to face her son, puts an arm around him.

				ASAKAWA	
		As hard as it is for us, what your 
		auntie and uncle are going through 
		right now is even harder, so lets 
		not talk about this over there, OK?

  Yoichi nods.

				ASAKAWA
			(remembering)
		You and her used to play a lot 
		together, didnt you?

  Yoichi says nothing.

  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT  

  RED PAPER LANTERNS mark this place as the site of a wake.  Several 
  GIRLS in high school uniforms are standing together and talking in 
  groups. Asakawa and Yoichi, walking hand in hand, enter the house.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 

  There are many PEOPLE milling about, speaking softly.  A MAN seated 
  at a counter is taking monetary donations from guests and entering 
  their information into a LEDGER.  Asakawa and Yoichi continue walking, 
  down a hallway.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT 

  Mother and son halt before the open DOOR to the main wake room, where 
  guests may show their respects to the departed.  The room is laid in 
  traditional Japanese-style tatami, a kind of woven straw mat that 
  serves as a carpet. Two GUESTS, their shoes off, are kneeling upon 
  zabuton cushions.  

  Kneeling opposite the guests is KOUICHI, Asakawas father.  The two 
  guests are bowing deeply, and Kouichi bows in response.

				ASAKAWA	
		Dad.

  Kouichi turns to see her.

				KOUICHI
		Ah!

				ASAKAWA
		How is sis holding up?

				KOUICHI
		Shes resting inside right now.  
		Shes shaken up pretty badly, you 
		know.  Its best she just take 
		things easy for a while.

  Asakawa nods.

				ASAKAWA
		Ill go check on auntie and them, 
		then.

				KOUICHI
		OK.  Ah, Yoichi.  Why dont you sit 
		here for a little while?

  He grabs the young boy and seats him on a cushion next to the two guests.  
  As the guests resume their conversation with Asakawas father, Yoichis 
  eyes wander to the ALTAR at the front of the room set up to honor the 
  deceased.  It is made of wood, and surrounded by candles, flowers, and 
  small paper lanterns.  At the center is a PICTURE of the deceased, a 
  teenage girl.  A small wooden PLAQUE reads her name: Tomoko Ouishi. It 
  is the same Tomoko from the first scene.

  Yoichi continues to stare at Tomokos picture.  He makes a peculiar 
  gesture as he does so, rubbing his index finger in small circles just 
  between his eyes.

  INT. HALLWAY  NIGHT

  Asakawa walks down the hallway, looking for her aunt.  She walks until 
  finding the open doorway to the kitchen.  There are a few people in 
  there, preparing busily. Asakawa sees her AUNT, who rushes into the 
  hallway to meet her, holds her fast by the arm.  The aunt speaks in a 
  fierce, quick whisper.

				AUNT		
		Have you heard anything more about 
		Tomo-chans death?

				ASAKAWA	
		No, I...

				AUNT		
		But the police have already finished 
		their autopsy!

				ASAKAWA	
		Well, they said there was no sign of 
		foul play.

				AUNT	
			(shaking her head) 
		That was no normal death.  They havent 
		once opened the casket to let us see
		the body.  Dont you think thats 
		strange?
 
  Asakawa looks away, thinking.

  INT. HALLWAY  NIGHT

  Yoichi has wandered off by himself.  He stops at the foot of the 
  steps, looking up-- and catches a glimpse of a pair of BARE FEET 
  running up to the second floor.  

  A guarded expression on his face, Yoichi walks slowly up the 
  stairs.  

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOS BEDROOM - NIGHT  

  Yoichi has wandered into Tomokos bedroom.  The lights are all off, 
  and there is an eerie feel to it.  Yoichis eyes wander about the 
  room, finally coming to rest on the TELEVISION SET.  Suddenly, he 
  hears his mothers voice from behind him.

				ASAKWAWA (O.S.) 
		Yoichi?

  Yoichi turns to face her as she approaches, puts an arm around him.

				ASAKAWA	
		What are you doing up here?  You
		shouldnt just walk into other 
		peoples rooms.

  Without replying, Yoichis gaze slowly returns to the television 
  set.  Asakawa holds him by the shoulders, turning him to meet 
  her.

				ASAKAWA	
		You go on downstairs, OK?

				YOICHI	
		OK.

  He turns to leave, and Asakawa follows.

  INT. OUSHI HOUSEHOLD - TOP OF THE STAIRS  NIGHT

  Just as Yoichi and Asakawa are about to descend the steps, 
  Asakawas CELL PHONE rings.  She opens the clasp to her PURSE.

				ASAKAWA	
			(to Yoichi) 
		You go on ahead.

				YOICHI	
		K.

  He walks down the steps.  Asakawa brings out her cell phone, 
  answers it.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				OKAZAKI	
		Uh... this is Okazaki.  Ive got 
		some more info on that article for
		you.  The girl was a student of 
		the uh, Seikei School for Women in 
		Yokahama City.

  Asakawa blinks at this, looks disturbed.


				ASAKAWA	
			(softly) 
		Thanks.

  She hangs up the phone.

  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT  

  Asakawa stands now at the entrance of the house.  Dazedly, she 
  walks toward a large, hand-painted PLACARD.  The placard reads 
  that the wake is being held for a student of the Seikei School 
  for Women. 

  Asakawa stares at that placard, making the mental connections.  
  She turns abruptly, walks towards a nearby TRIO of HIGH SCHOOL 
  GIRLS.

				ASAKAWA	
		Excuse me.  This is, um, kind of a
		strange question, but by any chance 
		were you friends of that young girl
		that died in the car as well?

  The three girls turn their faces to the ground.

				ASAKAWA	
		Please.  If you know anything...

				GIRL RIGHT	
		They all died the same day.  Youko.  
		Tomoko.  Even Iwata, he was in a
		motorcycle accident.

				GIRL LEFT	
		Because they watched the video.

				ASAKAWA	
		Video?

				GIRL LEFT	
		Thats what Youko said.  They all
		watched some weird video, and 
		after that their phone rang.

				ASAKAWA	
		Tomoko-chan watched it, too?  
		Where?

  Girl Left shakes her head.

				GIRL LEFT	
		She just said they all stayed 
		somewhere.

				GIRL RIGHT	
		There was a girl with Tomoko when 
		she died.  Shes had to be 
		hospitalized for shock.

				GIRL MIDDLE
		They say she wont go anywhere 
		near a television.


  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH  DAY

  Asakawa and YOSHINO, another news reporter, are watching scenes 
  from the Yokohama car death.  In the footage there are lots of 
  POLICEMEN milling about, one of them trying to pick the door to 
  the passenger side.  Yoshino is giving Asakawa the blow-by-blow.

				YOSHINO
		The bodies of those found were 
		Tsuji Youko, age 17, a student of 
		the Seikei School for Women, and 
		Nomi Takehiko, age 19, preparatory 
		school student.  Both their doors 
		were securely locked.

  Onscreen, the policeman has finally picked the lock.  The door opens, 
  and a girls BODY halffalls out, head facing upwards.  Yoshino flicks 
  a BUTTON on the control panel, scans the footage frame by frame.  He 
  stops when he gets a good close-up of the victim. 

  Her face is twisted into an insane rictus of fear, mouth open, eyes 
  wide and glassy. Yoshino and Asakawa lean back in their seats.

				YOSHINO
		This is the first time Ive -ever- 
		seen something like this.

				ASAKAWA
		Cause of death?

				YOSHINO
		Couldnt say, aside from sudden 
		heart failure.

				ASAKAWA	
		Drugs?

				YOSHINO	
		The autopsy came up negative.


  Yoshino takes the video off pause.  Onscreen, a policeman has caught 
  the young girls body from completely falling out, and is pushing it 
  back into the car.  As the body moves into an upright position, we 
  can see that the girls PANTIES are mid-way around her left thigh.

				YOSHINO
		These two, about to go at it, 
		suddenly up and die for no 
		apparent reason. 

  He sighs.

				YOSHINO (contd)
		Do -you- get it?


  EXT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - DAY  

  Asakawas CAR is already halted before a modest-sized, two-story HOUSE 
  with a small covered parkway for a garage.  She gets out of her car, 
  closes the door.  She stares at the house, unmoving.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  KITCHEN - DAY  

  Asakawa stands before her SISTER RYOMI, who is seated at the kitchen 
  TABLE.  Ryomi is staring blankly away, making no sign of acknowledging 
  her sister.  The silence continues unabated, and Asakawa, pensive, 
  wanders idly into the adjoining dining room.  She takes a long look at 
  the television, the same television that had puzzled Tomoko by suddenly 
  switching itself on, sitting darkly in one corner.  Her reflection in 
  the screen looks stretched, distorted.


				RYOMI	(O.S.) 
		They tell me that Yoichi came to 
		the funeral, too. 

  Asakawa steps back into the kitchen.  She addresses her sister, who 
  continues to stare out at nothing.

				ASAKAWA
		Mmm-hmm.

				RYOMI
		They used to play a lot together, didnt they?  Upstairs.

				ASAKAWA	
		Yeah...

  Ryomi lapses back into a silence.  Asakawa waits for her to say more, 
  but when it is clear that nothing else is forthcoming, she quietly gives 
  up and exits the kitchen.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD  STAIRCASE - DAY  

  Asakawa climbs the steps to the second floor.  She makes her way down 
  the hall.

  INT. OUISHI HOUSEHOLD - TOMOKOS ROOM - DAY  

  As if intruding, Asakawa walks slowly, cautiously into Tomokos room.  
  The window to the room is open, and a single piece of folded white PAPER 
  on Tomokos desk flutters in the breeze.  Asakawa walks towards it, picks 
  it up.  It is a RECEIPT from a photo shop.  The developed photos have yet 
  to be claimed.  

  Asakawa senses something, spins to look over her shoulder.  Her sister 
  has crept quietly up the stairs and down the hall, and stands now in the 
  doorway to Tomokos room.  She appears not to notice what Asakawa has in 
  her hands, as her gaze has already shifted to the sliding closet door.  
  She regards it almost druggedly.

				RYOMI
			(haltingly) 
		This... this is where Tomoko died.

  FLASHBACK
				RYOMI (O.S.)
		Tomoko!

  Ryomis hands fling aside the CLOSET DOOR.  Within, she finds the pale 
  blue CARCASS of her daughter, curled up into an unnatural fetal position.  
  Tomokos mouth yawns gaping, her eyes glassy and rolled up into the back 
  of her head.  Her hands are caught in her hair, as if trying to pull it 
  out by the roots.  It is a horrific scene, one that says Tomoko died as 
  if from some unspeakable fear.

  PRESENT

  Ryomi sinks to her knees, hitting the wooden floor hard.  She puts her 
  face into her hands and begins sobbing loudly.  Asakawa says nothing.

  EXT. CAMERA SHOP  DAY

  Asakawa leaves the camera shop clutching Tomokos unclaimed PHOTOS.  She 
  walks out onto the sidewalk and begins flipping through them.  We see 
  Tomoko standing arm-in-arm with Iwata, her secret boyfriend. Tomoko and 
  her friends eating lunch.  The camera had its date-and-time function 
  enabled, and the photos are marked

    97 8 29.

  The next shot is of Tomoko, Iwata, and another young couple posing in 
  front of a SIGN for a bed and breakfast.  The sign reads:

    IZU PACIFIC LAND

				ASAKAWA	
		Izu...

  Asakawa continues looking through the photos, various shots of the 
  four friends clowning around in their room.  Suddenly she comes to a 
  shot taken the next day, at check out.  The friends are lined up, arms 
  linked-- and all four of their faces are blurred, distorted as if 
  someone had taken an eraser to them and tried to rub them out of 
  existence.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  KITCHEN - DAY

  Asakawa wears an APRON, and is frying something up on the STOVE.  Yoichi 
  stands watching.

				ASAKAWA	
		Look, Im probably going to be late
		coming home tonight, so just stick 
		your dinner in the microwave when 
		youre ready to eat, OK?

				YOICHI	
		K... Mom?

				ASAKAWA	
		Hmm?

				YOICHI	
		Tomo-chan watched some cursed video!


  Asakawa leaves the food on the stove, runs over to Yoichi and grabs him 
  by the shoulders.  She shakes him roughly.

				ASAKAWA	
		What did you say?  You are not to 
		speak of this at school, do you 
		hear me?

				YOICHI	
			(utterly unfazed) 
		I wont.  Im going to school now.

  Yoichi walks off.  Asakawa goes back to the stove, but stops after only 
  a few stirs, staring off and thinking.

  EXT. ROAD  DAY

  Asakawa drives her car speedily along a narrow country road, LEAVES 
  blowing up in her wake.

  INT. ASAKAWAS CAR - DAY  

  Asakawa mutters to herself, deep in thought.

				ASAKAWA	
		Theres no way...

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

  Asakawas car drives past a sign reading:

	IZU PACIFIC LAND

  EXT. IZU PACIFIC LAND - DRIVEWAY  DAY

  Asakawa has left her car and is walking around the driveway of what is 
  less a bed and breakfast and more like a series of cabin-style rental 
  COTTAGES. 

  She wanders about for a while, trying to get her bearings.  She pauses 
  now in front of a particular cottage and reaches into her PURSE.  She 
  withdraws the PICTURE from the photomat, the one that showed Tomoko and 
  her friends with their faces all blurred.  The four are posing in front 
  of their cottage, marked in the photograph as B4.  Asakawa lowers the 
  photo to regard the cottage before her.

    B4

  She walks to the door, turns the handle experimentally.  Its open.  
  Asakawa walks in.

  INT. PACIFIC LAND - COTTAGE B4  DAY

  Asakawa lets her eyes wander around the cottage.  It looks very modern, 
  all wood paneling and spacious comfort.  

  Her eyes rest on the TV/VCR setup at the front of the room.  Crouching 
  before the VCR now, she presses the eject button.  Nothing happens.  
  She fingers the inside of the deck, finds it empty, then reaches behind 
  to the rear of the VCR, searching.  Again, there is nothing.  Asakawa 
  presses the power button on the television, picks up the REMOTE, and 
  takes a seat on the SOFA.  She runs through a few channels but theyre 
  all talk shows, no clues whatsoever.  She flicks the TV off and leans 
  back in the sofa, sighing.

  Just then, she spies a LEDGER on the coffee table.  These things are 
  sometimes left in hotels in Japan, so that guests can write a few 
  comments about their stay for others to read.  Asakawa picks the 
  ledger up, begins thumbing through it.  She stops at a strange PICTURE
  obviously drawn by a child, that shows three rotund, almost entirely 
  round personages.  She reads the handwritten MESSAGE.

				ASAKAWA	
		"My dad is fat.  My mom is fat.  
		Thats why Im fat, too."

  She smiles in spite of herself.  

  Asakawa flips through the rest of the ledger, but theres nothing else 
  of any import.  

  She tosses it back onto the coffee table and, sighing again, leans into 
  the sofa and closes her eyes.

  EXT. OUTDOOR CAFÉ - DUSK  

  Asakawa eats silently, alone.

  INT. PACIFIC LAND - FRONT RECEPTION - NIGHT  

  Asakawa has returned to the bed and breakfast.  As she walks in the 
  door, the COUNTER CLERK rises out of his chair to greet her.

				CLERK
		Room for one?

				ASAKAWA	
		Um, actually Im here on business.

  She passes the clerk a picture of Tomoko and her three other friends.  
  He stares at it for a moment.



				ASAKAWA
		They would have stayed here on 
		August 29th, all four of them.  
		If theres any information you 
		might have...

				CLERK
		Uh, hang on just a minute.  

  The clerk turns his back to her, begins leafing through a guest log.

				CLERK	
			(to himself) 
		August 29th...

  While she waits, Asakawas eyes start to wander around the room.  
  Behind the desk is a sign reading Rental Video, and a large wooden 
  BOOKSHELF filled with VIDEOTAPES. They are all in their original boxes, 
  and she lets her eyes glance over the titles.  Raiders of the Lost Ark, 
  48 Hours--

  --and then, suddenly, she spies a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked 
  sleeve, tucked away in the back of the very bottom shelf.  She feels 
  the hairs on the back of her neck rise.

				ASAKAWA	
		That...

  The clerk looks up.

				CLERK
		Hmm?

  Asakawa stabs a finger excitedly towards the shelf.


				ASAKAWA
		That!  What tape is that?

  The clerk reaches out for it, grabs it.

				CLERK	
		This?  Hmm...

  The clerk pulls the tape out of its SLEEVE and checks for a label.  
  Its unmarked.

				CLERK
		Maybe one of the guests left it behind

  INT. PACIFIC LAND  COTTAGE B4 - NIGHT 

  Asakawa flips on the TV.  Its on channel 2, and there is nothing but 
  static. She kneels down to slide the tape into the deck and pauses a 
  moment, framed in the vaguely spectral LIGHT from the television 
  screen.  Steeling her nerves, she puts the tape into the machine, picks 
  up the remote, and presses play.


  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this 
  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP 
  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.  Afterwards, you can 
  come back here to check the meaning of the Japanese characters 
  displayed.


  THE VIDEOTAPE

  At first it looks like nothing has happened-- then Asakawa realizes that 
  she is now viewing recorded static instead of broadcast static.  She 
  watches, waiting, but the static continues unbroken.  Asakawa looks 
  down at the remote, is about to press fast forward, when suddenly the 
  picture on the screen clears and for a moment she thinks shes looking 
  at the moon.

  Its not the moon at all, she realizes.  The shape is round like a full 
  moon, but it seems to be made up of thin RIBBONS of cloud streaking 
  against a night sky.  And theres a FACE, she sees, a face hidden in 
  shadows, looking down from above.  

  What is this?

  The scene changes now, and Asakawa notes that the tape has that kind of 
  grainy quality one sees in 3rd or 4th generation copies.  The scene is of 
  a WOMAN brushing her long hair before an oval-shaped MIRROR.  The nerve-
  wracking grating as if of some giant metallic insect sounds in the 
  background, but the lady doesnt seem to notice.  The mirror the lady is 
  using to brush her hair suddenly changes position from the left part of 
  the wall before which she stands, to the right.  Almost instantly the 
  mirror returns to its original position, but in that one moment in its 
  changed location we see a small FIGURE in a white GOWN.  The woman turns 
  towards where that figure stood, and smiles.

  The screen next becomes a twitching, undulating impenetrable sea of the 
  kanji characters used in the Japanese language.  Asakawa can pick out 
  only two things recognizable:

    local     volcanic eruption

  Now the screen is awash in PEOPLE-- crawling, scrabbling, shambling 
  masses, some of them moving in reverse.  A sound like moaning accompanies 
  them.
  -

  A FIGURE stands upon a shore, its face shrouded.  It points accusingly, 
  not towards the screen, but at something unseen off to one side.  The 
  insect-like screeching sounds louder. 
  --

  Close up on inhuman, alien-looking EYE.  Inside that eye a single 
  character is reflected in reverse:  SADA, meaning "chastity."

  The eye blinks once, twice.  The symbol remains.
  ---

  A long shot of an outdoor, uncovered WELL.
  ----

  Sudden loud, blinding STATIC as the tape ends.

  Asakawa turns the TV off, looking physically drained.  She sighs shakily 
  and slumps forward, resting on her knees.  Just then, she glances at the 
  television screen.  She sees, reflected, a small FIGURE in a white gown 
  standing at the rear of the room.  Shocked, Asakawa draws in breath, 
  spins around.

  The room is empty.  Asakawa runs to the sofa to collect her jacket--

  --and the RINGING of the telephone stops her dead in her tracks.  Zombie-
  like, she walks towards the telephone, picks it up wordlessly.  

  From the other end comes the same metallic, insectoid SQUEAKING heard on 
  the video.  Asakawa slams the phone down and glances up at the CLOCK.  
  Its about seven minutes after 7 P.M.

				ASAKAWA	
			(to herself) 
		One week

  Asakawa grabs her coat, pops the tape out of the deck, and runs out the 
  door.

  EXT. STREET  DAY

  It is dark and raining heavily.  Yoichi, Asakawas son, is walking to 
  school, UMBRELLA firmly in hand.  The sidewalk is quite narrow, and Yoichi 
  comes to a halt when a second PERSON comes from the opposite direction, 
  blocking his way. Yoichi slowly raises his umbrella, peers up to look at 
  this other pedestrian.  It is a MAN, a BAG slung over one shoulder.  He 
  has a beard; unusual for Japan where clean-shaven is the norm.  

  The two continue looking directly at each other, neither moving nor 
  speaking.  Yoichi then walks around the persons left and continues on his
   way.  The man resumes walking as well.

  Caption-- September 14th.  Tuesday.

  EXT. OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT DOOR - DAY  

  The bearded man, whose name is RYUJI, reaches out to press the DOORBELL, 
  but the door has already opened from within.  Asakawa leans out, holding 
  the door open for him.  Neither of them speaks.  Wordlessly, Ryuji enters 
  the apartment.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - DAY  

  Ryuji puts his bag down, looks around the apartment.  The interior is dark, 
  ominous somehow.  He takes his JACKET off and wanders into the living room.  
  Asakawa is in the kitchen behind him, preparing TEA.  Ryuji spies the 
  collection of FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS in living room.

				RYUJI
		Yoichis in elementary school 
		already, is he?

				ASAKAWA	
		His first year.  What about you, 
		Ryuji?  How have you been 
		recently?

				RYUJI		
		Same as always.

  She takes a seat next to him, serves the tea.  On the coffee table 
  before them is a VIDEOTAPE in a plain, unmarked case.

				ASAKAWA
		And money is...?

				RYUJI
		Im teaching at university.

  Ryuji picks up his cup of tea but stops, grimacing, before it is to his 
  lips.  He rubs his forehead as if experiencing a sudden headache.  Ryuji 
  shakes it off and quickly regains his composure.

				RYUJI
		Anyway.  You said that the phone rang?

				ASAKAWA
		Thats right.

				RYUJI		
		So if I watch it too, that phone over 
		there--

  He gestures with his mug 

				RYUJI (contd)
		--should ring.

				ASAKAWA
		Ryuji, four people have already 
		died.  On the same day!

				RYUJI
			(flippant) 
		Well, why dont you try calling 
		an exorcist?

  He takes a sip of his tea.  Asakawa reaches quickly, grabs something 
  from the bookshelf behind her-- a POLAROID CAMERA.    She shoves it 
  into Ryujis hands, then turns to look down at the floor.

				ASAKAWA	
		Take my picture.

  Ryuji raises the camera to his eye.

				RYUJI		
		Turn this way.


				ASAKAWA	
			(unmoving) 
		Hurry up and take it.

  Ryuji snaps off a shot.  It comes out the other end and he takes it, 
  waits impatiently for an image to appear.  When it does, all he can 
  do is pass it wordlessly over to Asakawa.  Her face is twisted, 
  misshapen.  

  Just like the picture of Tomoko and her friends.

  Asakawa stares at it, horrified.  By the time she finally looks up, 
  Ryuji has already risen from his seat and slid the videotape into the 
  VCR.  Again, the screen is filled with static, only to be replaced 
  with what looks like the moon.  Asakawa slams the Polaroid on the 
  coffee table and goes outside onto the veranda.  

  EXT. VERANDA - DAY  

  Asakawa stares out at a view of the houses shaded in cloud and rain. 
  There is a knock on the glass door behind her.  A moment later, 
  Ryuji slides the door open.

				RYUJI		
		Its over.

  Asakawa re-enters her apartment.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

				RYUJI		
		Well, it looks like your phones not 
		ringing.

  Ryuji pops the tape from the deck, hands it to Asakawa.

				RYUJI	
		Make me a copy of this, will you?  
		Id like to do a little research
		of my own. Theres no reason to 
		write us off as dead just yet. 

  He dramatically takes a seat.

				RYUJI	(contd)
		If theres a video, that means that 
		somebody had to make it.

				ASAKAWA	
		Theres the guest list from the 
		cottage to look into... and the 
		possibility of someone hacking 
		into the local stations broadcast 
		signals.

  Asakawa pulls a NOTEPAD from her purse and begins busily scribbling 
  away.


  INT. NEWS STATION - DAY  

  Okazaki putters around.

  Caption- September 15th.  Tuesday.

  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH  DAY

  Asakawa sits by herself, reviewing the videotape.  She is replaying 
  the very last scene, an outdoor shot of a well.  She stares at it 
  carefully, and notices...

  The tape ends, filling the screen with static.  A split-second 
  afterwards, there is a KNOCK on the door and Okazaki enters, holding 
  a FILE.  Asakawa momentarily forgets about the video.

				OKAZAKI	
			(handing her the file)
		Heres that guest list you wanted.

				ASAKAWA	
		Oh, thanks.

				OKAZAKI	
		What are you gonna do with this?

				ASAKAWA	
		Uh... sorry, Im working on 
		something personal.

  EXT. IN FRONT OF A TRAIN STATION - DAY  

  Some quick shots of a FOUNTAIN gushing water, PIGEONS flapping away 
  looking agitated.  CUT to Ryuji sitting on a BENCH.  Hes deep in 
  thought, writing in a NOTEPAD. There are multitudes of PEOPLE about 
  him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going.  A PAIR 
  OF LEGS attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears, 
  heading directly for Ryuji.  Her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as 
  that pace progresses all other sounds FADE into the background, so 
  that all we can hear is the CLOMP, CLOMP as those legs walk to stand 
  just before Ryuji.  The pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime.  

  A gust of WIND rips by.  Ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his 
  ears rings the same hollowed, multi-voiced BABBLING heard on the 
  videotape.  The sound grows stronger.

				RYUJI (VO)
 		So, it was you.  You did it.

  The babbling fades, disappears as slowly the worlds normal 
  background sounds return.  Ryuji looks up, but the woman in white 
  is nowhere to be seen.

  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT  AFTERNOON

  Ryuji rides up on a BICYCLE. He turns the corner towards his 
  apartment and finds Asakawa seated on the steps, waiting for him.

				RYUJI		
		Hey.

  Asakawa notes in his face that something is wrong.

				ASAKAWA
 		What happened to you?

				RYUJI
			(gruffly)
		Nothing.

  He enters the building, carrying his bicycle.  Asakawa follows.

  INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON  

  The two walk down the hallway towards the FRONT DOOR to Ryujis 
  apartment.  He unlocks the door and they enter.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  AFTERNOON

  Ryuji and Asakawa enter the living room.

				RYUJI
		So, whatd you come up with?

				ASAKAWA
		I dont think any of the guests on 
		the list brought the tape with them.  
		I couldnt confirm it face-to-face 
		of course, but even over the phone I 
		got the feeling they were all being 
		upfront with me.

 				RYUJI
		How about the other angle?  Pirate 
		signals or...

  Asakawa shakes her head.

				ASAKAWA
		Therere no traces of any illegal 
		television signals being broadcast 
		around Izu. 

  She reaches into her purse, pulls out a large white ENVELOPE.


				ASAKAWA
		Heres that copy of the videotape 
		you wanted.

  Ryuji tears the package open.  He squats down on the tatami in 
  frontof his TV and slides the tape in.  Asakawa sits on the 
  tatami as well, but positions herself away from the TV and keeps 
  her eyes averted.  Ryuji glares over his shoulder at her.

				RYUJI
			(sternly) 
		Asakawa.

  She reluctantly scoots closer, looks up at the screen.  Ryuji 
  fast-forwards the tape a bit, stopping at the scene where the 
  woman is brushing her long hair before an oval mirror.  He puts 
  the video on frame-by-frame. 

				RYUJI
		Have you ever seen this woman?

  Asakawa regards the screen intently.

				ASAKAWA
 		No...

  The tape advances to the scene where the mirror suddenly changes 
  positions.  When it does, we can again see the small figure in the 
  white gown, a figure with long black hair. When Ryuji sees this 
  his body stiffens, becomes tense.  Asakawa notices but says nothing.  
  She also notices something else.

				ASAKAWA
			(excitedly) 
		Theres something strange about 
		this shot.

  She takes the remote from Ryuji, rewinds it a ways.  Onscreen, the 
  woman begins coming her long hair again.

				ASAKAWA	
		From this angle, the mirror should 
		be reflecting whoevers filming.

				RYUJI		
		So, what does that mean?

  Asakawa lets out a short sigh.

				ASAKAWA	
		Well, if the person who made this 
		is a pro, thered be a way around 
		that, I guess, but still...

  The screen changes, showing the mass of squiggling kanji characters 
  again.

				RYUJI		
			(reading) 
		Volcanic eruption... Eruption where?

  He pauses the screen, trying to make sense of what is written.


				ASAKAWA	
		This is gonna be impossible to figure 
		out on just a regular TV screen, 
		dont you think?

  They are both still staring at the screen when from behind them comes 
  the SOUND of someone opening the front door.  Ryuji turns off the TV, 
  ejects the tape from the deck.

				RYUJI	
		Come on in.

  Asakawa flashes a look at Ryuji and then turns her head back towards 
  the front door to see who has entered.  A cute, nervous-looking young 
  GIRL with short hair approaches slowly.  She is carrying a PLASTIC BAG 
  filled with groceries.

				RYUJI	
		Asakawa, meet my student, Takano Mai.

  He turns, addresses Mai.

				RYUJI	(contd)	
		This is Asakawa, my ex-wife.

  Ryuji gets up and walks conveniently away.

				MAI		
		Nice to meet you.  Im Takano.

				ASAKAWA	
		Asakawa. *


  > * As you may already be aware, Japanese name order is the 
  >opposite of Englishs, and even close friends may continue to
  >address one another by their last names.  Incidentally, Asakawas
  >first name is Reiko.  In this scene, Mai deferentially refers
  >to Ryuji as sensei, meaning teacher.


  Mai sets the bag of groceries down and chases after Ryuji.  He is 
  putting on his jacket and getting ready to leave.

				MAI	
		Sensei, the people from the 
		publishing company called about 
		the deadline on your thesis again. 

				RYUJI		
			(brusquely) 
		Whatre they talkin to you 
		about it for?

				MAI		
		Because they can never get a 
		hold of you.

  Ryuji picks up his keys, video firmly in hand.

				RYUJI		
		Ask them to wait another week.

				MAI		
		Sensei, ask them yourself, 
		please.

  Ryuji is already headed for the door.  His back is to her as he 
  responds.

				RYUJI	
		OK, OK.

  Asakawa walks after him.  They leave.

  Mai pouts unhappily a bit, and then breaks into a smile as an idea 
  crosses her mind.  She walks across the room to where Ryuji has set 
  up a large BLACKBOARD filled with mathematical equations.  Grinning, 
  Mai rubs out part of one equation with her sleeve and writes in a 
  new value.

  INT. NEWS STATION  HALLWAY - NIGHT  

  Asakawa and Ryuji stride purposefully.  They stop before a DOOR to 
  the right, which Asakawa unlocks.  They both walk in.

  INT. NEWS STATION - VIEWING BOOTH - NIGHT 

  Asakawa and Ryuji sit in a completely darkened room, their eyes 
  glued to the television MONITOR.  They are again watching the scene 
  with the fragmented kanji characters, but despite their efforts have 
  been able to identify only one additional word, bringing the total 
  to three:

	volcanic eruption	  local	     residents

				RYUJI		
		This is impossible.

  Ryuji fast forwards, stopping at the scene with the kanji reflected
  inside an alien-looking EYE.  He reads the kanji aloud. 

				RYUJI
		Sada... 

  Ryuji moves to make a note of this, notices the time.

				RYUJI
		Is Yoichi gonna be all right?

				ASAKAWA	
			(sadly) 
		Hes used to it...

  Short silence.  Ryuji breaks it by gesturing towards the screen. 


				RYUJI
		Whoever made this had to have left 
		some kind of clue behind.  Theyre 
		probably waiting for us to find it.

  Asakawa turns a DIAL to bring up the volume, which up until now has 
  been  on mute.  The room is filled with an eerie, metallic GRATING, 
  and Asakawa spins the dial again, shutting it off.  Just as she does, 
  Ryujis eyes widen.

				RYUJI	
		Wait a minute.

  He turns the dial again, punches a few buttons as if searching for 
  something.  He listens carefully, and when he hears that strange 
  something again he stops, looks at the screen.

  It is paused at the scene with the figure, pointing, a CLOTH draped 
  over its head.  The figure now looks oddly like a messenger.

  Ryuji and Asakawa exchange glances.  This could be it.  Ryuji flips 
  some more switches, setting the sound for super-slow mo.  What follows 
  is a strange, labored sort of speech- a hidden message-- framed in 
  the skittering distortion of the tape in slow motion. 

				TAPE	
		Shoooomonnn bakkkkkarrri toou...  
		boooouuuukonn ga kuuru zouuu...

				RYUJI	
			(repeating) 
		Shoumon bakkari, boukon ga kuru 
		zo.  Did you hear that, too?

  Asakawa nods.  Ryuji is already writing it down excitedly.

				ASAKAWA	
		What does that mean?

  Ryuji tears the sheet of paper off the notepad, folds it, and tucks 
  it into his shirt pocket.

				RYUJI		
		Im gonna check it out.

  EXT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT COMPLEX - MORNING  

  Yoichi is walking to school.  He looks back over his shoulder, just 
  once,then resumes walking.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - MORNING

  All the lights are turned off, and she is sitting on the living room 
  couch watching the footage of her café interview with the junior high 
  school girls.  

  Caption-- September 16th.  Thursday.

  Just when the girl in the interview mentions that whomever watches 
  the video is supposed to afterwards receive a phone call, Asakawas 
  own phone RINGS, startling her. She runs to answer it.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		Ive got it.  Its a dialect, just 
		like I thought.  SHOUMON means 
		playing in the water and BOUKON
 		means monster. *


  >* Translated from standard Japanese, the phrase from the videotape 
  >would initially have sounded like, "If only SHOUMON then the 
  >BOUKON will come."  These two capitalized words, later identified to 
  >be dialectical, were at the time completely incomprehensible to Ryuji 
  >and Asakawa.  Dialect can vary dramatically from region to region in 
  >Japan, to the point of speakers of different dialect being unable to
  >understand one another.  

  >The phrase on the tape can now be rendered, "If you keep playing in 
  >the water, the monster will come for you."


				ASAKAWA	
		But, dialect from where?

				RYUJI	
		Oshima.  And the site of our 
		eruption is Mt. Mihara.

  INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT  

  Ryuji and Asakawa are seated at cubicles, looking through bound 
  ARCHIVES of old newspaper articles.  Asakawa sneaks a look at Ryuji, 
  stands up and walks off a little ways.  She has already pulled out her 
  cell phone.

				ASAKAWA	
			(whispering, on phone) 
		Yoichi?  Im gonna be a little 
		late tonight, honey. 

  Ryuji looks over his shoulder at her, scowls.

				ASAKAWA
		You can do it yourself, right?  OK.  
		Sorry.  Bye.

  She hangs up, returns to her seat at the cubicle.  She resumes her 
  scanning of the newspaper articles, and Ryuji shoots her another scowl.  
  Asakawa turns a page and then stops, frowning.  She has spied an article 
  that looks like...

  Nervously, Asakawa puts the thumb and forefinger of each hand together, 
  forming the shape of a rectangle.  Or a screen.  She places the rectangle
  over the article she has just discovered, its headlines reading:

    Mount Mihara Erupts 	Local Residents Urged to Take Precautions

  Ryuji notices her, leans forward excitedly.

				ASAKAWA	
		Ive got it!  This old article...

  The two scan the remainder of the page, and find a smaller, related 
  article.	

    Did Local Girl Predict Eruption?
    A young lady from Sashikiji prefecture...

  The two read over both articles, absorbing the details.  Ryuji stands 
  suddenly, gathering his things.

				ASAKAWA
		What are you doing?

				RYUJI		
		Has your newspaper got someone out 
		there at Oshima?

				ASAKAWA	
		I think so.  There should be a 
		correspondent out there.

				RYUJI	
		I need you to find out, and let me 
		know how to get hold of him.
		Tonight.

  He begins walking briskly away.  Asakawa chases after him.

				ASAKAWA	
		What do you think youre--?

				RYUJI	
			(angrily) 
		Youve only got four days left, 
		Asakawa!  Your newspaper contact 
		and I can handle this from here 
		on out.  You just stay with Yoichi.

  Ryuji strides off.  Asakawa stands motionless.

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY  

  A car speeds along.  CUT to a gravel DRIVEWAY leading up to a wooden, 
  traditional-style HOUSE.  Kouichi, Asakawas father, is standing before 
  the entrance and puttering around in his GARDEN.  The car from the 
  previous shot drives up, comes to a halt.  The passenger door opens and 
  Yoichi hops out, running towards the old man.  Asakawa walks leisurely 
  after her son.


				YOICHI	
		Grandpa!

				KOUICHI	
		Whoa, there!  So, you made it, huh?

  Caption-- September 17th.  Friday.

				ASAKAWA
		Yoichi says hes looking forward to 
		doing some fishing with you.

				KOUICHI	
		Is that so?

  Yoichi begins tugging excitedly at his grandfathers arm.

				YOICHI	
		Cmon grandpa, lets go!

				KOUICHI	
		OK, OK.  Well get our things 
		together and then we can go.


  EXT. RIVER  DAY  

  Asakawa stands on a RIVERBANK while her father and Yoichi, GUMBOOTS on, 
  are ankle-deep in a shallow river.  Yoichi holds a small NET, and 
  Asakawas dad is pointing and chattering excitedly. 

				KOUICHI
		There he is!  Cmon, there he is, 
		dont let him go!

  Yoichi tries to scoop up the fish his grandfather is pointing out.

				KOUICHI
		Oh, oh!  Ah... guess he got away, 
		huh?

				YOICHI	
		That was your fault, grandpa.

  Asakawas father laughs.

				KOUICHI	
		Well, whaddya say we try again?

  He begins sloshing noisily out to the center of the stream, Yoichi in 
  tow.

				KOUICHI
		Well get im this time.

  Asakawa looks away, pensive.

  INT. KOUICHIS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT  

  Yoichi is passed out asleep on the tatami mats.  A TELEVISION looms 
  inone corner of the living room, but it is switched off.  The 
  SLIDING DOORS to the adjacent guest room are open and we can see 
  futons set out, ready for bed.

  Asakawa enters the living room and, seeing Yoichi, scoops him up in
  her arms and carries him over to the guest room.

				YOICHI
			(sleepily) 
		How was work, mommy?

  Asakawa tucks him into the futons and walks silently off.

  INT. KOUICHIS HOUSE - STAIRCASE  NIGHT  

  Asakawa stands at the foot of the staircase, telephone RECEIVER in 
  hand.  The phone rests on a small STAND by the staircase.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		Yeah.  Your Oshima contact came 
		through.  It looks like the woman 
		who predicted the Mihara eruption 
		is the same woman from the video.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  NIGHT

  Ryuji is crouched in front of the TV, REMOTE in hand.  The screen is 
  paused on the scene of the woman brushing her long hair.

				RYUJI
		Her name is Yamamura Shizuko.  She 
		committed suicide forty years ago 
		by throwing herself into Mt. Mihara.

  INT. KOUJIS HOUSE  STAIRCASE - NIGHT  

				ASAKAWA
		Have you got anything else?

				RYUJI (O.S.) 
		Im gonna have to check it for 
		myself.  Ill be leaving for 
		Oshima tomorrow morning.

				ASAKAWA
		Oshima?  Ive only got three days 
		left!

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		I know.  And Ive got four.

  Short silence.

				RYUJI (O.S.)
		Ill be in touch.

  Ryuji hangs up.  Asakawa, deep in thought, slowly places the phone 
  back in its CRADLE.  She turns around to walk back down the hallway 
  only to find her father standing there, face full of concern.

				KOUJI
		Whats happened?

  Asakawa shakes her head.

				ASAKAWA
		Nothing.  I just had some things 
		left over from work.

  She walks past her father, who glances worriedly after her over his 
  shoulder.

  INT. KOUJIS HOUSE - GUEST ROOM  NIGHT

  The lights are all off and Asakawa is asleep in her futon.  Her eyes 
  suddenly fly open as a VOICE sounding eerily like her deceased niece 
  Tomoko calls out to her.


				TOMOKO (O.S.) 
		Auntie?

  Asakawa looks around the room, gets her bearings.  Her eyes fall on 
  the futon next to hers.

				ASAKAWA
		Yoichi?

  There is a BODY in that futon, but it is full-grown, dressed all in 
  black.  It is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned 
  away.

  Suddenly, the IMAGE from the video of the figure with its face 
  shrouded springs to Asakawas mind.  Just an instant, its pointing 
  visage materializes, and then disappears.  It reappears a moment 
  later, pointing more insistently now, and disappears again.  

  Asakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is 
  empty.  Yoichi is nowhere to be seen.

  Just then, she hears that high-pitched, metallic SQUEAKING from the 
  video.  Eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart--
  --and there, seated before the television, is Yoichi.

  He is watching the video.

  It is already at the very last scene, the shot of the outdoor well. 
  CLOSEUP on the screen now, and for just an instant we can see that 
  something is trying to claw its way out of the well.  The video cuts 
  off, and the screen fills with static.  

  Shrieking, Asakawa races over to Yoichi, covers his eyes though it is 
  already too late.  She scoots over to the VCR, ejects the tape and 
  stares at it uncomprehendingly.  She is then at Yoichis side again, 
  shaking him roughly.

				ASAKAWA
		Yoichi!  You brought this with you, 
		didnt you?  Why?!?

				YOICHI	
		Tomo-chan...

  Asakawa freezes, her eyes wide.

				YOICHI	
		Tomo-chan told me to watch it.

  EXT. OCEAN  DAY
  
  WAVES are being kicked up by a large PASSENGER SHIP as it speeds on 
  its way.  CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji standing on deck, looking out over 
  the waves.

				RYUJI	
		I shouldve been more careful.  
		When I was at your place that 
		day, I could feel something 
		there.  I thought it was just 
		because of the video... 

				ASAKAWA	
		You mean that Tomoko

				RYUJI		
		Thats not Tomoko.  Not anymore.



				ASAKAWA	
		Yoichi... he can see them too, 
		cant he?

  Ryuji nods his head, lowers it sadly.

				ASAKAWA	
		Its all my fault.  First Tomoko 
		died, then those three others.  It 
		should have stopped there, but it 
		didnt.  Because of me.

				RYUJI	
		I wonder...

  Asakawa turns to Ryuji suddenly.

				ASAKAWA
		How did the rumors about the 
		video even start in the first 
		place?


				RYUJI	
		This kind of thing... it doesnt 
		start by one person telling a 
		story.  Its more like everyones 
		fear just takes on a life of its 
		own.

				ASAKAWA	
		Fear...

				RYUJI
		Or maybe its not fear at all.  
		Maybe its what we were 
		secretly hoping for all along.

  EXT. PORT  DAY  

  The ship has docked, its GANGPLANK extended.  Ryuji and Asakawa walk 
  the length of the gangplank towards the shore.  A man named MR. 
  HAYATSU is already waiting for them.  He holds up a white SIGNBOARD 
  in both hands.
 
				ASAKAWA	
		Mr. Hayatsu?

				HAYATSU	
		Aah, welcome!  You must be tired 
		after your long trip.  Please, 
		this way.

  Mr. Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to an awaiting minivan.

  Caption-- September 18th.  Saturday.

  INT. HAYATSUS MINIVAN - DAY  

  Ryuji and Asakawa sit in the back.  Mr. Hayatsu is behind the wheel, 
  chattering away.

				HAYATSU	
		Back in the old days, the Yamamuras
		used to head fishing boats out in 
		Sashikiji, though they dont much 
		anymore.  You know, one of Shizukos 
		cousins is still alive. Hes just an 
		old man now.  His son and his 
		daughter-in-law run an old-fashioned 
		inn.  I went ahead and booked 
		reservations for yall, hope thats 
		alright...

  Asakawa gives the briefest of nods in reply, after which the 
  minivan lapses into silence.  Asakawa looks dreamily out at the 
  mountain-studded landscape, then suddenly snaps to.

				ASAKAWA
			(to Ryuji) 
		Why did Yamamura Shizuko commit 
		suicide?

				RYUJI	
		She was taking a real beating 
		in the press, being called a 
		fraud and all sorts of names.  
		After a while she just lost it. 

  CUT to a scene of the minivan speeding along a country road.

  INT. HAYATSUS MINIVAN  DAY 

				RYUJI
		Shizuko was getting a lot of 
		attention around the island after
		predicting the eruption of Mt. 
		Mihara.  Seems that for some time 
		shed had a rather unique ability:
		precognition. It was around then
		that she attracted the attention 
		of a certain scholar whom you may 
		have heard of; Ikuma Heihachiro.   

				ASAKAWA
		He was driven out of the university, 
		wasnt he?

  Ryuji nods.

				RYUJI
		This Professor Ikuma convinces 
		Shizuko to go to Tokyo with him, 
		where he uses her in a series of 
		demonstrations meant to prove the 
		existence of ESP.  At first shes 
		the darling of the press, but the 
		next thing you know theyre 
		knocking her down, calling her a 
		fraud.  Hmph.  Forty years later,
		the media still hasnt changed that
		much.

  Asakawa continues, ignoring Ryujis barb.

				ASAKAWA
		Ive heard this story.  But... Im 
		sure I remember hearing that somebody 
		died at one of those demonstrations.

  A strange look crosses Ryujis face.  He looks away, ignores her 
  for a moment.

				RYUJI
		After getting kicked out of 
		university, Ikuma just vanished, 
		and no ones been able to get hold 
		of him since.  Hes probably not 
		even alive anymore.

				ASAKAWA
		But, why even try looking for him?

				RYUJI
		Because hes supposed to have had a 
		child with Shizuko.  A daughter.

  Asakawa freezes.  In her mind, she sees a small FIGURE dressed in 
  white, its face hidden by long, black HAIR.  It is the figure from 
  the video.

  EXT. OUTSIDE YAMAMURA VILLA - DAY  

  Mr. Hayatsu leads Asakawa and Ryuji to the entrance.

				HAYATSU	
		Hello?

  The INKEEPER, a middle-aged lady named KAZUE wearing a traditional 
  KIMONO, comes shuffling up.  She addresses Mr. Hayatsu.

				KAZUE	
		Thank you.

  She turns to Asakawa and Ryuji.

				KAZUE (contd)
		Welcome.

				HAYATSU
		Well, Ill be off then.

  He gives a little bow and is off.  Kazue, meanwhile, has produced 
  two pairs of SLIPPERS, which she offers to Ryuji and Asakawa.

				KAZUE
		Please.

  Ryuji and Asakawa begin removing their shoes. 

  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA  STAIRCASE - DAY  

  Kazue leads Ryuji and Asakawa up a shadowed, wooden STAIRCASE.

				KAZUE
		And for your rooms, how shall we...? 

				RYUJI
		Separate, please.

				KAZUE
		Sir.

  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA - 2ND FLOOR  DAY

  Kazue gives a little bow.

				KAZUE
		This way.

  Kazue turns to the right.  Almost immediately after reaching the 
  top of the steps, however, a strange look crosses Ryujis face.  
  He heads down the opposite end of the corridor, Asakawa close 
  behind.

				KAZUE
			(alarmed) 
		Sir!

  Ryuji flings open the SLIDING DOOR to one of the older rooms.  There, 
  hanging from one of the walls, is the oval-shaped MIRROR from the 
  video, the one used by the mysterious lady to brush her long hair.  
  Ryuji stares at the mirror, almost wincing.  He turns around as if 
  to look at Asakawa,but continues turning, looks past her.  Asakawa 
  follows his gaze, as does Kazue.  Standing at the end of the corridor 
  is an old man, MR. YAMAMURA. 

  Yamamura regards them silently, balefully.  Breaking the silence, 
  Kazue gestures for Asakawa and Ryuji to follow.

				KAZUE
			(softly) 
		Please, this way.

  Asakawa races past the innkeeper towards the old man.  He keeps his 
  back turned towards her.

				ASAKAWA
		Please!  If you could just answer 
		a few questions, about Shizuko...

				YAMAMURA
		I got nuthin to say.

				ASAKAWA
		Its about Shizukos daughter.

  The old man says nothing.

				ASAKAWA
		She did have a daughter, didnt she?

  Yamamura regards her for a moment, then turns to walk away.

				YAMAMURA	
  		Youre wasting your time.

  INT. YAMAMURA VILLA - DINING ROOM  NIGHT

  The TABLE is laid out with an elaborate-looking DINNER.  Asakawa 
  sits alone, knees curled up to her chin, eyes wide and frightened.  
  She is whimpering softly to herself.  Just then, the DOOR slides 
  open and Ryuji walks in.  He sits at the table and picks up a 
  pair of CHOPSTICKS.

				RYUJI		
		Arent you gonna eat?

				ASAKAWA	
		Umm...

				RYUJI		
		Hm?

				ASAKAWA	
		Youll stay with me wont you?  
		When its time for me to die.

				RYUJI		
		Oh, stop it.

  Asakawa scoots across the tatami mats towards the table, grabs 
  Ryuji fiercely by the arm.

				ASAKAWA
		Youll stay, wont you?  If you 
		stayed, maybe youd learn something
		that could help Yoichi--

				RYUJI
		I said stop it!  Have you forgotten 
		There was a girl with Tomoko when 
		she died?  That girls now in a 
		mental institution.  Who knows what 
		could happen. 

				ASAKAWA	
		But you could stay with me, Ryuji.  
		Youd be OK.


				RYUJI
			(angrily)
		Why, because Im already not 
		right in the head?

  Asakawa releases her hold on Ryujis arm, lowers her head.  Ryuji 
  slams his chopsticks down angrily.

				RYUJI	
		If thats the case, why not just
		let things run its course, get rid
		of father -and- son?  Yoichi was a
		mistake, anyway.

				ASAKAWA
		Stop it!

  Short silence.  When Ryuji speaks up again, his voice is soft, 
  reassuring.

				RYUJI	
		We still have two days left...

  Just then the VOICE of the innkeeper calls tentatively out from 
  the other side of the sliding door.

				KAZUE (O.S.) 
		Excuse me?

				RYUJI	
		Come in.

  Kazue slides the door open.  She stands hesitantly in the doorway, 
  something tucked under one arm.


				KAZUE	
		Its about Miss Shizuko.  

  Ryuji shoots a glance at Asakawa and stands up from the table, 
  walks towards the innkeeper.

				KAZUE	
		This is all that there is...

  Kazue produces an old black and white PHOTOGRAPH.  The photo shows a 
  WOMAN, seated, dressed in a KIMONO.  A MAN in a Western-style SUIT 
  stands beside her.  

				RYUJI	
		Is this Professor Ikuma?

  Hearing this Asakawa leaps up, walks over to examine the picture for 
  herself.

				KAZUE
		...yes.  This picture is from before 
		Id entered the household.  

  She pauses a moment.

				KAZUE (contd)
		I should go now.

  The innkeeper scuttles off, leaving Asakawa and Ryuji alone with the 
  photograph.  Unbidden, the VOICE from the video enters their 
  thoughts.

				VOICE
		Shoumon bakkari... boukon ga kuru zo...


  EXT. IZU SEASHORE - DAY

  Asakawa watches Ryuji stride down the shore.

  Caption-- September 19th.  Monday.

  Ryuji strolls up to find old man Yamamura sitting alone, staring 
  out at the sea.  Yamamura glances up to see Ryuji approaching.  
  Ryuji takes a seat next to the old man, but its Yamamura who speaks 
  first.  The deep basso of his voice emphasizes the drawl of his 
  accent.

				YAMAMURA	
		Yalld do best to be off soon.  
		Seas probably gonna be rough 
		tonight.

				RYUJI		
		What kind of a child was Shizuko?

				YAMAMURA 
		Shizuko was... different.  Shed come 
		out here by herself everday an just
		stare out at the ocean.  The fishermen 
		all took a dislikin to her.  Oceans 
		an unlucky place for us, ysee: every 
		year it swallows up more of our own. 
		You keep starin out at somethin 
		ike that... 

				RYUJI
      		Shoumon bakkari shiteru to, boukon ga 
		kuru zo.  If you keep playing in the 
		water, the monster will come for you.

  Yamamura looks at Ryuji, surprised.  

				RYUJI
		Shizuko could see inside people, 
		couldnt she?  Down to the places 
		theyd most like to keep hidden.  It 
		must have been difficult for her...

  Yamamura rises unsteadily to his feet, features twisted angrily.

				YAMAMURA
 		Please leave!  Now!

  Ryuji stands, takes hold of Yamamuras arm.

				RYUJI
		Ive got a little of that ability 
		myself.  It was you who spread the 
		word about Shizuko, wasnt it?  
		And you who first contacted 
		Professor Ikuma?

				YAMAMURA	
		Whatre you--?

				RYUJI
		You thought youd be able to make 
		some money off her.  You even got 
		some, from one of the newspapers.

				YAMAMURA		
		Leave me the hell alone!

  Mr. Yamamura strides angrily off.  Both Ryuji and Asakawa take 
  pursuit, Ryuji calling out from behind Yamamuras back.


				RYUJI		
		Tell us about Shizukos daughter.  
		Who was she?

				YAMAMURA	
		I dont know!

				RYUJI		
		She was there, with Shizuko. She 
		had to be.

  Yamamuras pace, which has become increasingly erratic, finally 
  causes him to stumble and fall.  Ryuji comes up behind him, 
  grasping him firmly.  At their touch Ryujis power awakens, and as 
  he peers into the old mans mind there is a sudden blinding

  FLASH

  The setting is a large MEETING HALL.  A number of people are seated 
  in folding chairs before a STAGE, on which are a four MEN in BUSINESS 
  SUITS and a WOMAN in a KIMONO.  A BANNER hangs above the stage, which 
  reads PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION ON THE EXISTENCE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.  

  FLASH

  Ryuji eyes widen as he realizes he is seeing Shizukos demonstration 
  before the press.  He also realizes--

				RYUJI
			(to Yamamura)
		You were there!

  FLASH

  YAMAMURA SHIZUKO, the woman in the kimono, is sitting at a TABLE 
  onstage. Her face is calm and expressionless.  Standing off to one 
  side and peering from behind the curtains is a young Mr. Yamamura.

				RYUJI	(O.S.) 
		You stood there and watched the 
		demonstration.

  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa comes running up toward Ryuji and the 
  prone Mr. Yamamura.  Suddenly there is another

  FLASH

  Asakawa, her eyes wide, finds herself inside the scene, reliving it 
  as if she had actually been there.  She watches as Shizuko receives 
  a sealed clay POT in both hands.  Shizuko regards the pot a moment 
  and then places it gently on the table before her.  She takes a 
  calligraphy STYLUS from the table, begins writing on a thin, 
  rectangular sheet of RICE PAPER.  The members of the press talk 
  excitedly, craning their necks for a better look.

  Onstage, a JUDGE holds up the phrase written by Shizuko and the 
  folded sheet of paper taken from the sealed pot.  The phrase on both 
  sheets is identical.

				JUDGE		
		Match.

  Cameras begin FLASHING excitedly.  Shizukos features melt into a soft 
  smile. 

  The experiment is performed again, and again the phrase written by 
  Shizuko corresponds to the sealed sheet of paper.

				JUDGE
		Match.

  Again and again, Shizuko unerringly demonstrates her power to see 
  the unseen.  Finally, a bearded REPORTER explodes from his chair, 
  begins striding angrily towards the stage.

				REPORTER	
		Faker!  This is nothing but trickery, 
		and the lowest form of trickery at 
		that. 

  The reporter stops at the foot of the stage, points his finger 
  accusingly at Shizuko.

				REPORTER	
		What are you trying to pull, woman?

  A SECOND REPORTER sitting in the front row also rises to his feet.

				REPORTER #2	
		Thats right!  Professor Ikuma, 
		youre being fooled!

  By now most of the press has risen from their chairs, pointing and 
  shouting angrily. Onstage, Shizuko backs away, eyes wide and 
  frightened.  She covers both ears, trying to block out the increasing 
  din.  Professor Ikuma holds her protectively by the shoulders.  The 
  first reporter is still shouting angrily, his voice rising above the 
  others.  Suddenly, a pained look crosses his face and he collapses to 
  the floor.  The crowd, and Asakawa as well, see that the reporters 
  face is contorted into a grotesque mask of fear.

				REPORTER #3	
		Whats happened?

				REPORTER #4	
		Hes dead!



				REPORTER #5	
			(to Shizuko) 
		Witch!

  Professor Ikuma begins leading Shizuko offstage.  They stop as someone 
  unseen steps up, blocking their passage.  Shizukos eyes widen, her 
  head shaking in disbelief.

				SHIZUKO
		Sadako?  Was it you?

  CUT to Ryuji on the beach.  He looks up excitedly.

				RYUJI		
		Sadako?!

  He recalls the image from the video, the alien eye with the single 
  character SADA reflected in reverse. *


  >* The majority of girls' names in Japanese end in either -mi ("beauty") 
  >or -ko ("child").  Thus, Sadako means "Chaste child."  Sadako is, of 
  >course, the mysterious daughter of Shizuko and Professor Ikuma.


				RYUJI
		Sadako killed him?  She can kill 
		just with a thought?

				YAMAMURA	
		Shes... a devil spawn.

  CUT back to the demonstration hall.  Sadako, her face completely hidden 
  by her long hair, runs offstage... and heads directly for Asakawa.  
  Asakawa instinctively raises her arm, and Sadako grasps it fiercely.  
  All the nails on Sadako hand are stripped away; her fingers are raw, 
  bloody stumps.

  CUT back to the beach.  Asakawa, still caught in the throes of the 
  vision, has begun to swoon.  Finally her legs give out and she crumples 
  to the beach.  Ryuji grabs hold of her supportively.  He glances down at 
  her wrist, sees an ugly, purple BRUISE already beginning to form.  

  The bruise is in the shape of five long, spindly fingers.

  Mr. Yamamura slowly rises to a sitting position, and together the three 
  watch the approach of ominous, dark STORM CLOUDS.

  INT. MR. HAYATSUS HOUSE  DUSK

  Asakawa is on the phone, her voice almost frantic.

				ASAKAWA
		Thats right. After Yamamura Shizuko 
		committed suicide, Professor Ikuma
		took the daughter and ran.  No, no one
		knows where they went.  Thats why I 
		need -you- to find out where they are.  
		Even if the professors dead, Sadako 
		should still be in her forties.  Ill 
		explain it all later, but right now 
		just hurry!

  Asakawa slams the phone down.  PAN to show Ryuji slumped in one corner 
  of the room, his back to the wall.

				RYUJI	
		Sadakos probably already dead.  She
		could kill people with just a thought, 
		remember?  Her mother wasnt even 
		close to that.


				ASAKAWA	
			(flustered) 
		Well, what about that video?  If 
		Sadakos dead then who made it?

				RYUJI	
		Nobody made it. It wasnt made at 
		all. That video... is the pure, 
		physical manifestation of Sadakos 
		hatred.

  Ryuji turns to regard Asakawa, his eyes blank.

				RYUJI
		Weve been cursed.

  There is a moment of silence before Mr. Hayatsu slides the door open, 
  almost falling into the room.  He is out of breath, and speaks rapidly.

				HAYATSU	
		Its no good.  With the typhoon 
		coming in, all ships are 
		temporarily staying docked.

				RYUJI	
		What about the fishing boats?  
		Tell their captains Ill pay.

				HAYATSU
		Fishing boats?  Sir, without knowing 
		whether this typhoon is going to hit 
		us or not, I think itd be better to 
		wait and see how things turn--

  Ryuji interrupts him, slamming both palms on the table.  Glasses 
  rattle wildly.

				RYUJI	
		Fine!  Ill try searching myself!

  Ryuji stands and races past Mr. Hayatsu out into the rain.  Hayatsu 
  takes pursuit, calling after him.

				HAYATSU	
		Mr. Takayama!?  Mr. Takayama...

  Asakawa, left alone, stares down at the tatami mats.

  EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT  

  White-capped waves roll angrily in a black sea.

  INT. MR. HAYATSUS HOUSE  NIGHT

  Asakawa sits at a table, alone, her hands clasped as if in prayer.  Her 
  eyes are wide and glassy.  The phone RINGS suddenly and Asakawa dives 
  for it, wrenching it from the cradle before it can ring a second time.

				ASAKAWA	
		Hello?

				OKAZAKI (O.S.) 
		Mrs. Asakawa?  Im sorry.  I tried, 
		but I couldnt come up with any 
		leads at all.

  A look of abject fear crosses Asakawas face.  She begins retreating 
  into herself.


				OKAZAKI (O.S.) 
		Hello?

				ASAKAWA
			(softly) 
		Thank you...

  Asakawa slowly places the phone back in its cradle.  Almost immediately, 
  her face begins to crumple.  She falls to her knees, sobbing into the 
  floor.

				ASAKAWA	
		Yoichi...

  She cries a while longer but suddenly stops.  Her face, eyes streaked 
  with tears, shoots suddenly up, stares directly at the telephone.

				ASAKAWA	 
			(softly) 
		Izu...

  EXT. IZU WHARF  NIGHT

  Asakawa stands looking down on the wharf, scanning. 

  Several FISHING BOATS are docked.  The wind whips her hair crazily 
  around.   She continues scanning, and suddenly she spies--

				ASAKAWA	
			(calling) 
		Ryuji!

  Asakawa runs down onto the wharf, heading towards Ryuji.  He is 
  in mid-conversation with Mr. Hayatsu.

				ASAKAWA	
		Ryuji!  The phone in my apartment 
		never rang!  It only ever rang at
		the rental cottage!  Professor 
		Ikuma mustve...

				RYUJI	
		And weve got no way of going back.

				HAYATSU	
		Its too dangerous!  The thought of 
		anybody going out in this weather...

  The three fall into silence as they realize the powerlessness of their 
  situation.  Suddenly, a deep VOICE booms from behind them.

				YAMAMURA (O.S.) 
		Ill take you out.

  The three spin around to see Mr. Yamamura, his ROBES flapping in the 
  gusty night air. He begins walking towards them.

				YAMAMURA	
		Sadako is callin yall, reckon.  
		Mayhap to drag you down under the 
		water.

  Short silence.  Ryuji shoots a short questioning glance at Asakawa, 
  turns back to face Mr. Yamamura.

				RYUJI	
		Please.  Take us out.



  EXT. OCEAN  NIGHT

  A tiny FISHING BOAT is tossed about on the waves.  Mr. Yamamura stands 
  at the wheel, his face expressionless.

  INT. MR. YAMAMURAS FISHING BOAT  NIGHT

  Ryuji and Asakawa are crouched close together in the cabin.  Asakawas 
  expression is dreamy, faraway.

				ASAKAWA
		Its funny.  Im not afraid at all.  

  Ryuji leans over, rubs her hand comfortingly.  Suddenly he switches 
  back into analytical mode.

				RYUJI	
		Sadako probably died back out there
		at Izu, before the rental cottages 
		were ever built.

				ASAKAWA	
		So, Sadako was Professor Ikumas 
		daughter?

				RYUJI
			(nodding) 
		Ikuma smuggled her out in secret.  
		His relationship with Shizuko was 
		already a scandal, and one of the 
		reasons he got drummed out of the 
		university... Weve gotta find 
		Sadakos body.



				ASAKAWA
			(excitedly) 
		Is that going to break the curse?  
		Will Yoichi be all right?

				RYUJI	
		Its all weve got left to try.

				ASAKAWA	
		Just one more day...

  Ryuji puts his arm around Asakawa.

  EXT. MR. YAMAMURAS FISHING BOAT - DAWN  

  Ryuji stands on deck, looking out over the water.  He heads down 
  below toward the captains area.  Mr. Yamamura is at the wheel.

				RYUJI	
		We made it.  Maybe Sadako doesnt 
		have it out for us after all.

  Long pause as Mr. Yamamura says nothing.

				YAMAMURA
		Shizuko... she used to -speak- to 
		the ocean, just ramble away.  One 
		time I hid, listenin to one of her 
		conversations.

  Mr. Yamamura pauses again.

				YAMAMURA (contd)	
		And it werent in no human language.


  EXT. MR. YAMAMURAS FISHING BOAT  DAWN

  Asakawa has climbed out on deck and is looking up towards the sunrise.

  Caption-- September 20th.  Monday.

  EXT. HARDWARE STORE  DAY

  Ryuji races out of the store, loaded down with supplies.  He holds a 
  pair of BUCKETS in one hand and a CROWBAR and SHOVEL in the other.  A 
  length of ROPE is coiled over his left shoulder.  He runs towards a 
  RENTAL CAR, passing by Asakawa who stands at a PAYPHONE, receiver in 
  hand.

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Hello?

				ASAKAWA	
		Yoichi?  Its mommy.  I just called 
		to say Ill be coming home tomorrow.

  Ryuji shoots a look at her over his shoulder.

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Im tired of it here, mom!  I wanna
		go back to school.

				ASAKAWA
			(smiling) 
		Yoichi, its rude to your grandpa 
		to talk like that.

				YOICHI (O.S.) 
		Hes laughing.  You wanna talk to him?

				ASAKAWA	
		No, thats...

  Asakawa pauses, her voice hitching.  She seems about to lose 
  her composure.

				ASAKAWA	
		Im sorry, Yoichi.  Ill... Ill 
		see you tomorrow.  

				YOICHI (O.S.)	
		Whats wrong?

  Asakawas face scrunches up in an effort to hold back tears.

				ASAKAWA	
		Mommys got something she has to do.  
		Say hello to grandpa for me, OK?

  Ryuji stands by the car, scowling over at Asakawa.  He shuts the DOOR 
  just short of a slam.  CUT to Asakawa hanging up the phone.  She half-
  runs towards the rental car and enters the passenger side, staring 
  blankly into space.  Ryuji slides into the drivers seat, buckles his 
  SEATBELT.  

				RYUJI		
		What time was it when you first 
		watched the video?

  Asakawa glances at her watch.

				ASAKAWA	
		Seven or eight minutes past 
		seven.  PM.  No more than ten 
		minutes past.
 		
				RYUJI
		If the rumors are true, that 
		time is gonna be our deadline.

  Asakawa buckles up as Ryuji steps on the gas.

  INT. RENTAL CAR  DAY

  Asakawa sits in the passenger side.  Her face is almost angelic, 
  with the faintest hint of a smile.  Ryuji shoots a questioning look 
  at her.

  EXT. COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

  The white rental car tears past the SIGN reading Izu Pacific Land.  
  The car continues into the LOT, screeching around corners before 
  coming to an abrupt halt.  Asakawa, her face still oddly expressionless, 
  gets out of the passenger side.  Ryuji exits as well, the hint of a 
  shudder running through him as he regards the series of rental cabins.

				RYUJI		
		-Here-.

  CUT to Asakawa and Ryuji walking up the gravel PATH towards the rental 
  cabins.  Ryuji looks back over his shoulder as both he and Asakawa stop 
  before cabin B4.  The cabin is on STILTS, its underbelly fenced off by 
  wooden LATICEWORK.  Ryuji drops most of his supplies to the ground, but 
  keeps hold of the PICK.  He raises the pick over one shoulder and begins 
  smashing away at the latticework.  When he has cleared enough space for   
  passage, he begins picking up supplies and tossing them hastily within.  
  When finished, he holds a hand out for Asakawa.  The two enter the 
  earthen basement.


  UNDER COTTAGE B4 - DAY  

  Ryuji pulls a FLASHLIGHT out, flicks it on.  The BEAM arcs outwards, 
  illuminating what looks more like an old mine shaft than a modern 
  rental cottage.  The beam halts when it suddenly encounters an old 
  STONE WELL.  The well is badly chipped on one side, and sealed off 
  with a solid-looking stone LID.  Ryuji rushes quickly towards it.

				RYUJI
		I knew it!  The well.

  He squats down beside the well, setting the flashlight on the 
  lid.  Asakawa sinks slowly down beside him.

				ASAKAWA
		The well...

  Ryuji reaches out and takes Asakawas hand.  He sets their enclasped 
  hands onto the lid, and together they begin lightly tracing the 
  surface of the lid with their free hands.  Asakawa closes her eyes in 
  concentration... and suddenly, as with the incident on the beach, 
  Asakawa finds herself drawn into Ryujis psychometric VISION.

  FLASH

  The picture is black and white, grainy like old film.  A YOUNG GIRL in 
  a WHITE GOWN walks slowly towards an open well. She places her hand on 
  the LIP of the well, peers curiously down.  

  FLASH

  Asakawa looks up, her eyes wide open.

  FLASH
  
  There is now a second person in the vision, an ELDERLY MAN in an old-
  fashioned tweed SUIT standing behind the young girl.  He suddenly 
  produces some BLADED OBJECT, and strikes the girl savagely across the 
  back of the head.  

  The girl falls forward. The man drops to the ground, grabbing the girl 
  behind the knees and hoisting her limp BODY over the lip and into the 
  well.  The body falls into its depths.

  Panting heavily, the man leans forward and grasps the lip of the well 
  with both hands, looking down.  He flashes a guilty look in either 
  direction, checking that his crime has gone unnoticed, and as he does 
  so Asakawa realizes that she knows this face.  The image from the 
  videotape, like a face in the moon: it had been Sadako inside the well, 
  looking up to see this man staring back down at her.

  This man whose name is Professor Ikuma Heihachiro.

  FLASH

				ASAKAWA
		Her own father!

  The energy seems to drain out of Asakawa in a rush, and her body 
  crumbles.  Ryuji catches hold of her.

				RYUJI		
		It was Ikuma who put this lid on.  
		And Sadakos still inside.

  Ryuji stands quickly, takes hold of the crowbar.  He inserts it under 
  the lid and begins trying to pry it off, face scrunched with effort.  
  Asakawa digs her fingers in and lends her own strength as well. Slowly,
  the lid begins to move.  Ryuji tosses the crowbar aside and the two 
  lean the combined weight of their bodies into it.  The lid slides off, 
  dropping to the earth with a dull THUD.  Ryuji sits to one side, winded 
  with effort, as Asakawa takes hold of the flashlight.  She shines it 
  down into the well, but it only seems to intensify the gloom. What 
  WATER she can see looks fetid and brackish.  Ryuji sees her expression 
  and begins removing his JACKET.

				RYUJI
		Ill go.

  He walks off, leaving Asakawa alone.

  CUT to an overhead shot of the well.  A ROPE is fastened to one side, 
  and Ryuji has already begun lowering himself down.  His eyes wander 
  overthe grime-smeared WALLS, and with a shudder he begins to pick out 
  human FINGERNAILS.  Torn loose and spattered with blood, countless 
  fingernails line the sides of the well. 

				RYUJI
 		Sadako was alive!  Shed tried to 
		climb her way out.

  Ryujis face twists into a grimace as if momentarily experiencing 
  Sadakosterrible agony.  He waits a moment longer before edging his 
  way down the rope again, finally SPLASHING to rest at the bottom of 
  the well.  He holds his flashlight above the brackish water, calls up 
  to Asakawa.

				RYUJI
		Lower the buckets!

  Asakawa nods and lowers two plastic BUCKETS fastened to a rope.  Ryuji 
  grabs one and scoops up a bucketful of water, tugging on the rope when 
  finished.

				RYUJI
		Take it up!

  Asakawa hoists the bucket up to the rim of the well.  She walks a small 
  distance and tosses the contents out onto the ground.  She happens to 
  glance through the wooden lattice to the outside, and with a start 
  realizes that the sun has already started to set.  A nervous glance at 
  her WATCH later and she is back at the well, lowering the empty bucket 
  to find another full one already awaiting her.

				RYUJI
		Take it up!

  In the well, Ryuji glances at his watch.  He looks at it for a long 
  moment, the expression on his face saying Were not going to make it.  
  Time passes as Asakawa pulls up bucketload after bucketload, her 
  strength beginning to fade.  She half-stumbles, glances up... and is 
  shocked to realize that NIGHT has fallen.

  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling up yet another bucket, her strength 
  almost gone.  She looks at her watch and sees that it is now past 
  6:00.  She calls frantically down to Ryuji.

				ASAKAWA
		Its already six!

				RYUJI
			(explosively) 
		I know!  Hurry up and TAKE IT UP!!

  The bucket slowly jerks into motion.  Asakawa pulls it up to the rim 
  of the well, holds it unsteadily.  She takes one faltering step and 
  falls, spilling the buckets contents onto the ground.  

  CUT to Ryuji in the well, standing ready with another bucketful.


				RYUJI
 		Take it up!

  Nothing happens.  

				RYUJI
		Asakawa!

  The bucket begins moving, even slower than before.  CUT to Asakawa, 
  her body trembling with effort. By now its all she can do to simply 
  keep her body moving.  She glances behind her, sees through the wooden 
  lattice that it is now pitch black.  A look of resignation crosses her 
  face and she releases her hold on the bucket, her body crumpling and 
  falling in on itself. 
  
  CUT to the bucket splashing back into the well, narrowly missing 
  Ryuji.

				RYUJI	
			(fuming) 
		What the hell are you doing?  Trying 
		to get me killed?

  CUT back to Asakawa, her face dead.  Ryuji calls out from the well.

				RYUJI (O.S.) 
		Hey!

  Asakawa falls backward onto the ground, arms splayed. CUT to the rim 
  of the well.  Ryuji pulls himself up over the rim, catches sight of 
  Asakawa.

				RYUJI
		Asakawa!

  She lifts her head up but says nothing as Ryuji walks over to her.

				RYUJI
		Well change.  Youre in no condition 
		to keep this up.

  Asakawa suddenly springs into life.  Her voice is frantic, fearful.

				ASAKAWA:	
		No!

				RYUJI
		Who do you expect to pull up these 
		buckets, then?

				ASAKAWA
		But, we dont even know if its doing 
		any good...

  Ryuji strides forward and slaps Asakawa painfully across the cheek.  
  He begins shaking her roughly for good measure.

				RYUJI
		And what about Yoichi, huh?  Is his
		mother not coming to pick him up 
		after all?

  He releases his hold on her.  The two stare at each other a long time, 
  saying nothing.
 
  CUT to an overhead shot of Asakawa being lowered into the well. CUT 
  now to Asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with 
  grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright.  
  Unable to resist the impulse, Asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder 
  and down into the well.  The dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in 
  and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic.

				RYUJI
		Dont look down!

  She returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward.  CUT to Ryuji leaning 
  over the rim of the well, peering down at her.  For an instant, 
  everything becomes monochrome. Its not Ryuji looking down at her at 
  all; its Professor Ikuma, checking to see if shes still alive or 
  if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off.  CUT to 
  Asakawa, her eyes wide with fright.

  Asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well.  A FLASHLIGHT hangs 
  from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness.  
  Asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water.  
  She calls out pleadingly.

				ASAKAWA
		Where are you?  Please, come out.

  Asakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope.  A full bucket 
  already awaits.  She tugs on the rope and Ryuji pulls it up.  

  She scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending 
  it up.  Instead, she begins running her arms through the water again, 
  her voice close to tears.

				ASAKAWA
		Please.  Where are you?

  Asakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes 
  of stagnant water.  With a start, she realizes that her fingers have 
  caught something.  Seaweed?  Asakawa draws her hands close for a 
  better look... and sees that is HAIR.  A thick clump of long, black 
  hair.

  Suddenly a pale, thin ARM shoots out from beneath the water, catching 
  Asakawa just below the wrist.  Asakawas ears are filled with a SOUND 
  like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber.  It 
  is a GIRL, her face completely hidden by long, black hair.  CUT to a 
  shot of Asakawas face.  Far from being frightened, her features are 
  oddly placid.  She regards the fearsome thing before her with an 
  almost tender look.  Asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long 
  hair.  

				ASAKAWA
		Its you...

  She strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head 
  with a loud SQUELCH. Revealed is not a face at all but a SKULL.  Its 
  sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the 
  green SLUDGE it has pulled up from the bottom of the well.  Like a 
  mother comforting a frightened child, Asakawa pulls the skeletal 
  remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. Her eyes 
  begin to glaze.

  CUT to Ryuji racing up to the rim of the well, leaning down intently.

				RYUJI
		Hey!  Asakawa!  Its already 10 
		minutes past seven!  We did it!

  Down in the well, Asakawa continues staring blankly ahead.  Her body 
  suddenly falls forward, limp.

  EXT. OUTSIDE COTTAGE B4  NIGHT

  Three POLICE CARS are parked outside the rental cottages, crimson 
  headlights flashing.   A few COPS walk by, two of them carrying 
  something off in white PLASTIC BAGS.  CUT to Ryuji and Asakawa 
  sitting on the curb.  Asakawa is staring off at something, a BLANKET 
  draped over her shoulder.  

				ASAKAWA	
		Why would Ikuma have killed her?  
		His own daughter...

				RYUJI
		Maybe she wasnt his daughter at all.  

				ASAKAWA
		What?

				RYUJI
		Maybe her father... wasnt even human.

  The two exchange glances.  Ryujis gaze falls to Asakawas WRIST, 
  which he suddenly takes and holds close to his face.  The ugly 
  bruise where Sadako had grabbed her has disappeared.

				RYUJI
		Its gone...  

  He shakes his head, clearing his analytical mind of their ordeal.

				RYUJI
		Enough, already.  Its over.  Cmon.  
		Ill take you home.

  Ryuji stands, pulls Asakawa to her feet.

  EXT. OUTSIDE ASKAWAS APARTMENT - NIGHT  

  Ryujis white CAR pulls up into the parking lot.  He and Asakawa 
  get out, regard each other from opposite sides of the car. There is 
  a long moment where neither of them says anything.

				RYUJI	
		Get some rest.  

  He flashes her the slightest of grins. 

				RYUJI (contd)
		I still have a thesis to finish. 

  CUT to a shot of Ryuji and Asakawa, the car creating an almost 
  metaphoric distance between them. 

				ASAKAWA
		...thank you.

  Ryuji nods silently by way of reply.  He gets into his car and 
  drives off.  Asakawa watches him go, and then walks towards the 
  entrance of her apartment.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  BEDROOM  MORNING

  Asakawa walks into her room, sits on the edge of her bed.  It is 
  now morning, and she sits dazedly watching the sun come up.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  MORNING

  Ryuji sits busily scribbling into a NOTEBOOK.  He stops writing a 
  moment to regard his notes while taking a sip of COFFEE.  He 
  glances over at his BLACKBOARD for confirmation when a small scowl 
  crosses his brow.  Its gone a moment later as he chuckles wryly 
  to himself.

				RYUJI
		That girl...

  Ryuji stands, walks over to the blackboard.  He fixes Mais little 
  prank with a single chalk stroke. 

  EXT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  VERANDA  MORNING

  Asakawa emerges, taking in the dawn.  At first her face is calm and 
  tranquil... but her features change as the sun almost noticeably 
  darkens and a WIND begins to kick up her hair.  She now looks very 
  anxious.

  Caption-- September 21st.  Tuesday.


  NOTE: This next scene is entirely visual.  If you are reading this 
  translation before watching the movie, do yourself a favor; STOP 
  reading this now and watch the scene for itself.


  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT  MORNING

  Ryuji is busy scribbling away at his notes again.  His hand suddenly 
  ceases, eyes dancing worriedly as he hears a faint...

  No.

  Breath rattling fearfully in his throat, Ryuji spins around to face 
  the TELEVISION SET.  He gets out of his seat for a better look, 
  falling to his knees on the tatami. 

  The image that fills the screen is the last scene from the videotape; 
  the shot of the well.  

  The SOUND from before comes louder now, more insistent, a metallic 
  screeching that both repulses and beckons him closer. Ryuji crawls on 
  all fours towards the SCREEN, stares at its unchanging image with 
  terrible foreboding.

  There is a flash of MOTION as something shoots out of the well. A 
  hand. First one, and then another, as Sadako, still in her grimy white 
  dress, face hidden beneath long, oily strands of hair, begins slowly 
  pulling herself out.  The television screen jumps unsteadily, fills 
  with static as if barely able to contain her image.  

  CUT back and forth between Ryuji, who is beginning to visibly panic, 
  and the television, which shows Sadako lurching ever closer.

				RYUJI
			(almost frantic) 
		Why?!

  The TELEPHONE rings, and Ryuji spins round towards it, breath catching 
  in his throat.  He looks at the phone, over his shoulder at the 
  television, back to the phone.

				RYUJI
		Thats it!  Asakawa...

  Ryuji scrambles wildly towards the phone.  He takes the receiver but 
  is unable to do more than clutch it fearfully as his gaze is drawn 
  inexorably back to the television.  Sadakos shrouded face has filled 
  the entire screen... and then, television popping and crackling, she 
  jerks forward and emerges from the television onto the floor of 
  Ryujis apartment.  Ryuji backs away, screaming in terror.

				RYUJI
		Aaargh!

  Sadako lies prone, collapsed, hair splayed out like a drowned corpse.  
  Only her FINGERS are active, crawling, feeling.  The TIPS of her 
  fingers are little more than bloodied stumps, not a single fingernail 
  on them.  She uses the strength in those fingers to pull herself 
  forward, coming jerkily to her feet.  The joints of her body twist 
  unnaturally, more insect-like than human.

  Ryuji flings the phone aside and begins scrambling about the apartment 
  as if looking for cover.  The strength has already begun to fade from 
  his body, however, and his movements are clumsy, exaggerated. He falls 
  to the floor, panting heavily.  

  Sadako turns to regard him, and for just an instant we can see beneath 
  her impenetrable shroud of hair; a single EYE burns with manic, 
  unbridled hatred.   

  Its gaze meets Ryujis, and his face twists into a grimace as he 
  SCREAMS loudly.

  FLASH

  EXT. KOUJIS HOUSE - FRONT YARD  DAY

  Yoichi sits on the lawn, doodling into a large SKETCHPAD.  He 
  suddenly stops, eyes registering that he has somehow felt his fathers 
  death.
  
  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT  DAY

  Asakawa clutches the RECEIVER to her ear.  She can still hear the 
  sounds of metallic SCREECHING coming from the video, though they are 
  now becoming softer.

  EXT. OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT BUILDING  DAY

  Asakawa comes running down a side street, turning the corner and 
  making for the entrance to Ryujis apartment building.  There is a 
  single GUARD posted at the entrance. He reaches out, catches Asakawa 
  lightly by the arm.


				GUARD
		Are you a resident here, maam?

				ASAKAWA
		Im Takayama Ryujis wife!

  The guard drops his hand, and Asakawa makes for the entrance.

				GUARD
		Im sorry maam, but theyve already 
		taken the body away.

  Asakawas spins around, eyes wide.  Body?

  INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE RYUJIS APARTMENT  DAY

  Mai is there, slumped against one wall. Asakawa comes running up, 
  dropping to her knees and grasping Mai by the shoulders.

				ASAKAWA
		What happened?

  Mai shakes her head dreamily.

				MAI
		When I got here he was just 
		lying there...

				ASAKAWA	
		Did he say anything to you?  About 
		a videotape?

  Mai shakes her head again, shakes it harder until the breath 
  catches in her throat.


				MAI
		His face...

  Mai falls into silence, curls up on herself.  Asakawa leaves her 
  and crosses toward the door to Ryujis apartment.

  INT. RYUJIS APARTMENT - DAY  

  The front DOOR opens wildly, noisily forward.  Asakawa comes 
  rushing in, eyes darting about the apartment.  She thinks 
  frantically to herself.

				ASAKAWA (VO)
		Ryuji... why?  Does this mean that
		Yoichi will die, too?  Is the curse 
		not broken yet?

  Her gaze falls to the television set.  She dives forward, presses 
  the eject button on the VCR.  Sure enough, the TAPE is still in 
  the deck.  She takes the tape and leaves.

  INT. ASAKAWAS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

  Asakawa walks slowly, dreamily forward.  She drops the videotape 
  loudly onto the coffee table and slouches into a CHAIR.  Her eyes 
  fall to the framed photographs of Yoichi on one of the shelves.  
  This snaps Asakawa out of her daze and she begins whispering 
  intently to herself, thinking.

				ASAKAWA
		I was the only one to break 
		Sadakos curse.  Ryuji... why...?  
		Something I did that you didnt...  
		Something I did that you didnt...  

  Asakawa gives up, lowers her face into her hands.  When she looks 
  up again, she happens to glance at the television screen-- and 
  its GLARE reveals that there is someone ELSE in the room with her.  
  It is the figure from the videotape, the silent accuser with the 
  cloth draped over its face.  With a start, Asakawa realizes that 
  the figure is wearing Ryujis clothes.

				ASAKAWA
		Ryuji?!

  She spins around, but the room is empty.  Asakawas mind races.  
  The figure had been pointing towards her BAG.  She stands, 
  rummages in her bag to produce her copy of the cursed videotape.  
  She takes Ryujis COPY in her other hand, her eyes darting 
  between the two tapes.

				ASAKAWA
		Something I did that you didnt...

  It suddenly clicks home as Asakawa looks full-on at Ryujis 
  version of the tape, plainly marked COPY.

				ASAKAWA
		What broke the curse was that I copied 
		the tape and showed it to someone else!

  CUT to Asakawa slowly pulling her VCR from the television stand.  
  A look of almost frightening resolve etches her face.

  EXT. HIGHWAY  DAY

  ARIAL SHOT of Asakawas car.  We hear her VOICE on the cell 
  phone.

				ASAKAWA (O.S.)
  		Dad?  Its me.  Im on my way over.
  		Look, dad, Ive got something to ask. 
		Its for Yoichi...

  INT. ASAKAWAS CAR  DAY

  CLOSEUP on the VCR in the passenger side.  CUT to Asakawa at the 
  wheel as time spirals forward, the decisions of the present 
  already become rumor of the future.

				GIRL A (VO) 
		They say theres a way you can stay 
		alive after you watch the video.  
		Youve gotta make a copy of it, and 
		show it to somebody else inside a week.

				GIRL B (VO) 
		But what about the person you show it 
		to?

				GIRL A (VO) 
		Well, then they make a copy and show it 
		to somebody else.  Again, inside a week.

				GIRL C (VO) 
			(laughing)
		Then theres no end to it.

				GIRL A (VO) 
		Thats just it.  There -is- no end.  But 
		if it meant not dying... youd do it, 
		wouldnt you?

  Asakawas eyes begin to well.  Her car speeds along the highway, 
  to the direction of menacing-looking STORM CLOUDS.

15	EXT.	A STILL FRAME OF A DENTON CATHOLIC CHURCH	DAY

					CHORUS (Cont)
			To the late night double feature
			Picture Show.

	The SONG ends with church bells ringing joyously as the IMAGE EXPANDS TO 
	WIDE-SCREEN.  The STILL FRAME bursts to life as the doors of the Denton 
	Catholic Church are flung open and Mendelssohn's wedding march resounds 
	from the church organ.

	The young married couple, RALPH and BETTY HAPSCHATT appear followed by a 
	crowd of friends and well-wishers throwing confetti and shouting 
	excitedly.

	The MINISTER shakes RALPH by the hand while RALPH slips him a $20 bill.

	PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures.

	BRAD MAJORS, a young slightly awkward, clean-cut American in his mid-
	twenties, comes over the congratulate RALPH.  BRAD and RALPH shake 
	hands.

					RALPH
			Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!

					BRAD
			Well I don't think there was any doubt
			about that - You and Betty have been
			almost inseparable ever since you sat
			in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.

					RALPH
			Tell you the truth Brad, she was the
			only reason I came in the first place.
			Science was never one of my favourite
			subjects but I sure with Dr Scott
			could have made it today.

					BRAD
			Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him.
			We drove over to see him last vacation.
			It's a shame his new job took him away
			from Denton.

	BETTY, the bride, throws the bouquet.

	JANET catches it.  She squeals with delight.

	The GUESTS cheer.

					RALPH
			Hey fella.  It looks like it could be
			your turn next.

					BRAD
			Who knows...ha ha.

	RALPH & BETTY drive off.  GUESTS wave and shout, BRAD & JANET with great 
	enthusiasm.  GUESTS begin to disperse.

	JANET & BRAD linger outside the church.  So do a strange FAMILY :  An 
	old man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter.  They resemble the 
	Quaker family in "American Gothic", a painting.

	The MOTHER (MAGENTA) and FATHER (RIFF RAFF) stand outside the church 
	doors.  Their DAUGHTER (COLUMBIA) goes inside.  The FAMILY, and the 
	MINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the GUESTS all resemble characters we 
	shall meet later at the Frank N. Furter place.

					JANET (who is holding the bouquet)
			Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't
			Betty look radiantly beautiful.  
			Just an hour ago she was plain old
			Betty Monroe.  Now she's Mrs. 
			Ralph Hapschatt.

					BRAD (Still looking after the car)
			Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a 
			lucky guy.  (They start to move d.s.)

					JANET
			Yes.

					BRAD
			Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful 
			little cook.

					JANET
			Yes.

					BRAD
			And Ralph himself will be in line for 
			promotion in a year or so.

					JANET
			Yes.

					BRAD (spoken)
			Hey Janet.

					JANET
			Yes Brad.

					BRAD
			I've got something to say.

					JANET
			Uh huh.

					BRAD
			I really loved the skilful way
			You beat the other girls
			To the bride's bouquet.

					JANET
			Oh Brad.

					BRAD
			The river was deep but I swam it.

					BRAD
			I've one thing to say and that's
			Dammit, Janet.
			I love you.

			The road was long but I ran it.
			(He runs backwards towards church doors)

					FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
			Janet.

					BRAD (Climbing onto fence)
			There's a fire in my heart
			And you fan it.  (Jumps off)

					FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
			Janet.

					BRAD
			If there's one fool for you
			Then I am it.

					FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
			Janet.

					BRAD (Getting chalk from pocket)
			I've one thing to say and that's,
			Dammit, Janet.

	He chalks a heart and arrow on the church door, which Riff Raff proceeds 
	to wipe off.

					BRAD
			I love you.

	JANET runs to him, he kneels and produces a ring.

					BRAD
			Here's a ring to prove that
			I'm not joker.

	CHURCH BELLS Peal out.  RIFF & MAGENTA open doors and solemnly enter the 
	church, door closes behind them.

					BRAD
			There's three ways that love can grow.
			That's good bad or mediocre.

	JANET grabs the ring as BRAD rises.  She throws down the bouquet and 
	would fall into BRAD's arms but he goes to the door to chalk on it 
	again.

					BRAD
			Oh - J - A - N - E - T
			I love you so.

	JANET, transfixed, bursts into the church.

17	INT. CHURCH		DAY

	"WEDDING SONG"  Pt. 2

	JANET bursts into the church, hypnotised by the ring.  BRAD follows her.

					JANET
			Oh!......It's nicer than
			Betty Munroe had

					MAGENTA (Peering up from behind pew)
			Oh Brad.

					JANET
			Now we're engaged and I'm so glad.

					MAGENTA & COLUMBIA
			Oh Brad.  (Both peer up and disappear)

					JANET
			That you met Mom
			And you know Dad.

					WHOLE FAMILY
			Oh Brad.  (peering up together)

					JANET (Taking his arm)
			I've one thing to say
			And that's, Brad
			I'm mad,
			For you too.

	BRAD & JANET start to walk d.s., arm in arm.

	the strange FAMILY march slowly across them l/r., in front.

					JANET (Laying head on Brad's sh.)
			Oh, Brad.

					BRAD
			Oh Dammit.

					JANET (Caresses his cheek)
			I'm mad.....

					BRAD
			Oh Janet

					JANET
			For you.

					BRAD (briefly kisses her)
			I love you too-oo-oo.

	BRAD takes JANET's hands, turning to her.  We are aware of THE FAMILY 
	bringing in coffin in b.g. through vestry door.

					BRAD & JANET
			There's one thing left to do-ah-ooh

	(They separate)

					BRAD
			And that's go see the man
			Who began it

					BRAD
			I've got one thing to say, and that's
			Dammit,

			I love you.

	JANET runs to BRAD and he hugs her.

					BRAD (Circling Janet)
			Dammit, Janet.

	JANET circles BRAD twice, admiring her ring on the way.

					JANET
			Oh Brad,
			I'm mad.

					BRAD
			Dammit, Janet.

	BRAD & JANET kneel together with each following word until they are 
	kneeling on the floor)

					BRAD, JANET, FAMILY.
			I love you.

	BRAD & JANET kiss.

18	INT.	A STUDY	NIGHT

	Mahogany bookcases, a large desk with a prominent globe of the world.  A 
	well-padded armchair has its back to the camera.  It swings around 
	revealing the NARRATOR.  He is in his smoking jacket.  He speaks 
	directly to us.

					NARRATOR
			I would like if I may to take you on a
			strange journey.

	He crosses to the bookshelf.  He selects a dossier.  We see the title: 
	"The Denton Affair".  He returns to his desk and places it on a 
	bookstand.  He puts on his reading glasses.

					NARRATOR
			It seemed a fairly ordinary night when
			Brad Majors and his fiancee Janet Weiss
			(two young ordinary healthy kids) left
			Denton that late November evening to
			visit Dr Everett Scott, ex. tutor and
			now friend of both of them.  It's true 
			there were dark storm clouds, heavy, 
			black and pendulous, toward which they 
			were driving.  It's true also that the 
			spare tyre they were carrying was badly 
			in need of some air.  But they being 
			normal kids and on a night out, well 
			they were not going to let a storm 
			spoil the events of their evening.

			On a night out.

	He closes the book marking the place.

	Thunder is heard distantly on the sound track.

					NARRATOR
			It was a night out they were going to
			remember for a very long time.

	Lighting cracks on the sound track.

	A windscreen wiper working under strain.  Torrential rain on the

	and listening to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The 
	Shadow.

	A motorcycle roars past them.

					JANET
			Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist
			that's passed us.  They certainly take
			their lives in their hands.  What with
			the weather and all.

					BRAD
			Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to
			that type.

	JANET takes another stick of gum.

	Offers BRAD some.  He declines.

	The car slows to a halt.

					JANET
			What's the matter Brad, darling?

	Headlights on sign reading: "DEAD END".

					BRAD
			I think we took the wrong fork a few

			Didn't we pass a castle back down the

	He unbuckles his seatbelt.

					JANET
			I'm coming with you.

					BRAD
			There's no point both of us getting wet.

					JANET
			I'm coming with you.

			Besides, darling, the owner of the phone

	She sing plaintively.

					JANET
			In the velvet darkness
			Of the blackest night
			Burning bright.

	We see the two of them - BRAD striding ahead, JANET nearly catching up 
	with him.

	Behind them on the side of the road, sparse trees and rock formations.

					JANET
			There's a guiding star
			No matter what or who you are.

	They have passed a row of trees.  A rock formation in the shape of a 
	castle is silhouetted against the sky.  It has a flag flying from the 
	turret.

	Lightning strikes.

	A glow of light appears in a window.  It illuminates a path to the 
	castle.

	BRAD and JANET turn.

	The castle is in the distance between the two of them.

					BRAD & JANET
			There's a light

	The castle looms in the distance.

	Taking JANET by the hand, BRAD moves off the roadway towards the house.

					BRAD
			I can see the flag fly
			I can see the rain
			Just the same
			There has got to be
			Something better here
			For you and me.

	Lighting strikes.

	JANET jumps towards BRAD.

					BRAD
			Just a moment, Janet.  They may have

	The door opens.  Throbbing music is heard in the background as if there 
	is a party going on in the distance.

	The figure we have seen at the window emerges.  He is a hunch-backed 
	servant, RIFF RAFF.

					RIFF RAFF
			Hello.

					BRAD
			Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors.
			And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I -

	vacuuming the stairs.

					RIFF RAFF
			This way.

	JANET steps over the vacuum lead.

					JANET
			Are you - giving a party?

					RIFF RAFF
			No.  You've arrived on a rather special
			night.  It's one of the master's affairs.

					JANET
			Oh, lucky him.

					MAGENTA
			He's lucky.

	BRAD and JANET look at MAGENTA, surprised by her voice.

					MAGENTA
			You're lucky, I'm lucky, we're all
			lucky.

40	SONG:		"THE TIME WARP"

	BRAD and JANET are rather unnerved by this outburst from the domestic.  
	They look back to RIFF RAFF.  He is now standing by a set of mirrors 
	reflecting to infinity.

					RIFF RAFF
			It's astounding
			Time is fleeting
			Madness takes its toll
			But listen closely
			Not for very much longer
			I've got to keep control.

	MAGENTA gives RIFF RAFF a strange signal.

	RIFF RAFF starts to dance in an extraordinary fashion.

					RIFF RAFF
			I remember doing the Time Warp.

	BRAD and JANET are amazed.

					RIFF RAFF
			Drinking those moments when
			The blackness would hit me.

	MAGENTA half closes her eyes in pleasure.

	JANET clings to BRAD.

					RIFF RAFF
			And the void would be calling.

	RIFF RAFF opens a set of double doors marked BALLROOM.

41	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

	BRAD and JANET find themselves on a balcony of a huge black and silver
	ballroom.  At the furthest end is a throne-like chair and, surrounding 
	it, a theatre proscenium.  In the body of the room are GUESTS.  They are 
	the people BRAD and JANET passed on the road.  They are the 
	Transylvanian Secret Agents - assembled on this special occasion from 
	all over the earth.  It is the Annual Transylvanian Convention - 
	announced by an official banner suspended over the Ballroom.  They are
	all dressed in strange but elegant evening wear.  They are a distorted 
	version of the GUESTS from the Denton wedding.  A party spirit prevails, 
	they throw their arms out in a plea to RIFF RAFF on the balcony.

					GUESTS
			Let's do the Time Warp again.

	JANET falls into BRAD's arms.

					BRAD
			Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want 
			to interfere with their celebrations.

					JANET
			This isn't the Junior Chamber of 
			Commerce Brad.

					BRAD
			They're probably foreigners with ways 
			different from our own.  -  They may 
			do some more folk dancing.

					JANET
			Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.

					BRAD
			I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.

	GUESTS rise, staring mesmerised at the lift.

	JANET sees the shoe, looks up at the face of its owner.

	JANET faints.

GO TO COLOUR AT BEGINNING OF FOLLOWING SCENE

54	INT.	LIFT/HALL	NIGHT

	The figure turns and throws open lift cage door.  As camera zooms in to 
	the death mask above them the film changes from black and white to 
	colour.  However the only colour in evidence is the red lipstick on the 
	mouth of their host.

	SONG:		"SWEET TRANSVESTITE"

					FRANK
			How do you do.

			I see you've met my faithful handyman.
			He's a little brought down - 
			Because when you knocked
			He thought you were the candyman.

	RIFF RAFF scowls.

54A	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

					FRANK
			Don't get strung out by the way 
			that I look.

	FRANK strides across the Ballroom to the throne.

					FRANK
			Don't judge a book by its cover
			I'm not much of a man
			By the light of day
			But by night I'm one hell of a lover.

	JANET gives a silent scream.

	FRANK lets the cloak fall onto the throne, which reveals his 
	transvestite attire.

	The GUESTS scream with delight.

					FRANK
			I'm just a sweet Transvestite
			From Transexual Transylvania.

	He slowly moves back to BRAD and JANET, doing leg kicks.

			Let me show you around, maybe play you a sound
			You look like you're both pretty groovie.

	He circles them and forces them into the Ballroom.

			Or if you want something visual
			not too abysmal
			We could take in an old Steve Reeves movie.

	BRAD clumsily attempts to circle around FRANK.  FRANK meanwhile ignores 
	him and greets his other guests.

					BRAD
			I'm glad we caught you at home
			Ah - could we use your phone
			We're both in a bit of a hurry.

	JANET joins BRAD.

					JANET
			Right!

					BRAD
			We'll just say where we are
			Then go back to the car
			We don't want to be any worry.

	FRANK turns on them.

					FRANK
			You got caught with a flat
			Well how about that
			Well babies don't you panic
			By the light of the night
			It'll seem alright
			I'll get you a satanic mechanic.

	FRANK turns his back on BRAD and JANET and splitting the ranks of his 
	GUESTS, departs for the other end of the Ballroom.  Streamers fall.

					FRANK
			I'm just a sweet transvestite
			From Transexual Transylvania.

	From the throne he gestures towards BRAD and JANET rather slowly over 
	the next verse.

					FRANK
			Why dont'cha stay for the night

					RIFF & MAGENTA
			"night"
			Or maybe a bite

					RIFF & MAGENTA
			"bite"
			I could show you my favourite obsession
			I've been making a man
			With blonde hair and a tan
			And he's good for relieving my tension.

	We view from OVERHEAD as the GUESTS surround him adoringly.

					FRANK
			I'm just a sweet transvestite
			From Transexual Transylvania.

	FRANK storms down the Ballroom to the lift.

			I'm just a sweet transvestite.

					GUESTS
			"Sweet Transvestite"

					FRANK
			From Transexual Transylvania.

					GUESTS
			"Transylvania"

	On the last chord the lift has disappeared.

	The GUESTS applaud ecstatically.

	RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA close in on BRAD and JANET.  They remove BRAD and
	JANET's wet clothes.

	COLUMBIA moves down from the bandstand and crosses to BRAD and JANET.  
	She witnesses the undressing.

					COLUMBIA
			Slowly, slowly.  It's too nice a job
			to rush.

	The GUESTS moan softly as each piece of clothing is removed.

	BRAD and JANET stand shivering in their underwear.

	There is complete silence.

	The GUESTS and SERVANTS are motionless.

	BRAD and JANET are the total object of their attention.

68	INT.	HALL/LIFT	NIGHT

					JANET
			Oh Brad.

					BRAD
				(confidentially)
			It's alright Janet, we'll play along
			for now and pull out the aces when the
			time is right.

	He turns to COLUMBIA who has been staring at his underpants.

					BRAD
			Ah, hi.  My name is Brad Majors and
			this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  You
			are ...

					COLUMBIA
			You are very lucky to be invited up
			to Frank's laboratory.  Some people
			would give their right arm for the
			privilege.

	RIFF RAFF has opened the cage doors to the lift.

	The GUESTS rush for positions.

					BRAD
			People like you maybe

					COLUMBIA
			I've seen it.

	COLUMBIA escorts them to the lift.

	RIFF RAFF throws two GUESTS to the floor to make room for them.
	He slams the cage door.

	The two discarded GUESTS cry and claw at the cage door as the lift moves 
	off under RIFF RAFF's control.

	BRAD and JANET are squashed, arms by their side.

	They stare straight ahead.

					JANET
				(to Magenta)
			It he - Frank - is he your husband?

	General amusement.

					RIFF RAFF
			The Master is not yet married.  Nor
			do I think he ever will be.  We are
			simply his servants.

					JANET
			Oh.

	The lift grinds to a halt.

	They have arrived at the laboratory.

								CUT TO

69	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	The laboratory is somewhere between a student observation operating 
	theatre and a Greek gymnasium.  It is pink-tiled throughout, facing the 
	lift entrance is a circular area containing a TANK on pedestals which
	though screened at this stage will be revealed to contain the body of 
	ROCKY submerged in chemicals, the wall to one side contains a raised 
	dias area for the GUESTS, and facing one end of the tank, the 
	operational controls, monitor and a giant refrigerator.  A chandelier 
	hangs above the tank.

	On the podium in front of Frank's chambers there is a stand microphone.  
	Near the podium are some weights.  Behind the tank is a vaulting horse.
	These are wrapped in sellophane - Rocky's presents.

	The GUESTS are waiting as the lift arrives.

	FRANK, now in surgeon's outfit stands in the middle of the room.  RIFF 
	RAFF gets out of the lift first, with a glass of champagne which he
	hands to FRANK.

					FRANK
			Magenta, Columbia, go and assist Riff Raff.

	As he speaks her name each one steps forward out of the lift.  They
	cross to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.

					FRANK
			I will entertain...ah...

	BRAD & JANET step out of the lift.

					BRAD
			I'm Brad Majors and this
			is my fiancee, Janet Vice.

					JANET
			Weiss.

					BRAD
			Weiss.

					FRANK (Taking Janet's hand to kiss)
			Encante....How nice.  (he circles them)
			And what charming underclothes you both have.
			(He takes two dust coats from Riff Raff 
			and hands them to Brad).
			But here, put these on.  They'll
			make you feel less vulnerable.

	MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the podium.

					FRANK (continues)
			It's not often we receive visitors here.
			Let alone offer them hospitality.

					BRAD (Moving towards Frank)
			Hospitality!  All we wanted to do was 
			use your telephone.  A reasonable request 
			which you have chosen to ignore.

					JANET (Hurring after Brad)
			Don't be ungrateful Brad.

					BRAD (Stepping closer to Frank)
			Ungrateful!

	The room falls silent.  All eyes are on FRANK, waiting for his reaction.  
	A smile breaks on his face.

					FRANK
			How forceful you are Brad.  Such a 
			perfect specimen of manhood.  So dominant.

	MAGENTA & COLUMBIA laugh.

			You must be awfully proud of him Janet.

					JANET
			Well, yes I am.

	THE GUESTS oh and ah appreciatively, BRAD laughs, a little embarassed.

					FRANK
			Do you have any tattoos Brad.

					BRAD
			Certainly not!

					FRANK
			Oh well.  How about you.  (He laughs)

	RIFF RAFF has approached behind FRANK, looming over his shoulder.

					RIFF RAFF
			Everything is in readiness, Master.
			We merely await your word.

	FRANK drinks his champagne then hands RIFF RAFF the empty glass.  RIFF 
	RAFF goes to the control panel and FRANK to the podium

					FRANK
			Tonight...One, one, one.  Can you hear 
			me at the back?
			Tonight, my unconventional conventionists.

	MAGENTA, COLUMBIA and GUESTS laugh politely.

					FRANK
			Tonight you are to witness a breakthrough 
			in biochemical research.

	There is a gasp from COLUMBIA, MAGENTA and GUESTS.

					FRANK
			And paradise is to be mine.

	GUESTS and everybody applaud.  JANET claps too, but BRAD indicates that 
	she shouldn't.

					FRANK
			It was strange the way it happened.
			One of those quirks of fate really.  
			One of those moments when you seem 
			irredeemably lost:  you panic; you're 
			trapped; your back's against the wall.
			There's no way out, and then suddenly, 
			you get a break.  (He cracks the bones 
			in his hand)  All the pieces seem to 
			fit into place.  What a sucker you'r 
			been. What a fool.  The answer was there
			all the time.  It took a small accident 
			to make it happen.  An accident!

	MAGENTA & COLUMBIA step forward one each side of him.

					MAGENTA & COLUMBIA (softly)
			An accident.

					FRANK
			That's how I discovered the secret.
			That elusive ingredient, that spark 
			that is the breath of life.

	GUESTS applaud.

					FRANK (Moving to tank)
			You see, Brad and Janet, you are fortunate.
			For tonight is the night that my beautiful
			creature is destined to be born.

	Everybody applauds.  FRANK then pulls the cover from the tank.  RIFF 
	RAFF is at the control panel.

70	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	The tank is revealed.  There is something inside it is immersed in clear 
	fluid.  The GUESTS are astonished.

					FRANK
			Throw open the switches on the sonic 
			oscillator.

	RIFF RAFF flicks the switch to activate the oscilloscopes in the panel.

					FRANK
			And step up the reactor power input 
			three more points.

	RIFF RAFF presses a button three times then begins to unwind a wheel.

	FRANK watches excitedly from behind the tank as the chandelier is 
	lowered.  It spurts different coloured liquids into the tank.

	The liquids bubble and change colour.  The thing inside begins to look 
	like a human form.

					JANET
			Brad...

					BRAD
			It's alright Janet.

	The liquids drain away.  The form begins to move.

	FRANK climbs the ladder at one end of the tank, RIFF RAFF the other.

	ROCKY HORROR sits up, raises his arms, finally stands upright with both 
	arms outstretched.

	RIFF RAFF removes the bandage from ROCKY's head.  ROCKY looks at RIFF 
	RAFF then at FRANK.  With a gasp he leaps for the chandelier above.

	At the same time RIFF RAFF is down the ladder making for the handle.  He 
	winds up the chandelier and ROCKY.

71	INT.	THE LABORATORY	NIGHT

	SONG:		THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES.

	ROCKY HORROR with only his head unbandaged, is hanging on to the 
	chandelier which RIFF RAFF is winding upwards.

					ROCKY
			The Sword of Damocles is
			Hanging over my head.

	FRANK runs down the ladder and kicks RIFF RAFF who starts to lower the 
	chandelier.  FRANK climbs up the other steps to meet his creation coming 
	down.  MAGENTA & COLUMBIA cross to the tank.

					ROCKY
			And I've got the feeling
			Someone's going to be
			Cutting the thread.

			Oh, woe is me.
			My life is a misery.

			Oh, can't you see
			That I'm at the start
			Of a pretty big downer....

	As ROCKY gets level with him, FRANK lunges for him but lands inside the 
	tank....because...

	ROCKY simultaneously abandons the chandelier, lands between MAGENTA and 
	COLUMBIA who now each have a pair of scissors with which they will snip
	his arm and leg bandages.

					ROCKY
			I woke up this morning
			With a start
			When I fell out of bed.

					GUESTS (inc. Riff, Magenta & Columbia)
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			And left from my dreaming
			Was a feeling
			Of un-nameable dread.

					GUESTS
			That ain't no crime

					ROCKY
			My high is low.
			I'm dressed up
			With no place to go.

			And all I know
			Is I'm at the start
			Of a pretty big downer.

	FRANK, in the tank behind ROCKY, puts his arms round ROCKY's neck.  
	ROCKY spins away.  MAGENTA and COLUMBIA hang on to one end of his chest
	bandage so that it undoes as he goes.

					GUESTS (inc. RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA)
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			Oh, no no, no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			No no no, no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime -
			That ain't no crime.

	ROCKY is now unbandaged.  He strikes a pose.

	During the last sequence, FRANK climbs out of the tank onto RIFF RAFF'S 
	shoulders and purses ROCKY, but they fall.

72	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT

	NARRATOR reading from book.

					NARRATOR
			Rocky needed peace of mind.
			He didn't know
			He was doing just fine.

			He was the product
			Of another time.
			And as for feeling down -
			Well that's not a crime.

73	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	FRANK and RIFF RAFF are recovering from their fall.

	ROCKY makes a circuit of the GUESTS.

					GUESTS (Riff, Magenta & Columbia)
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY (To first group of guests)
			The sword of Damocles is
			Hanging over my head.

					GUESTS
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY (To second group)
			And I've got the feeling
			Someone's going to be
			Cutting the thread.

					GUESTS
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY (To third group)
			Oh, woe is me - 
			My life is a mystery.

			(To fourth group)
			Oh can't you see
			That I'm at the start
			Of a pretty big downer.

	ROCKY set off at a run as FRANK looms up again.

	(FRANK is chasing ROCKY round the lab.)

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			Oh no no no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			No no no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.
			That ain't no crime.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			No no no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime.

					ROCKY
			No no no no.

					GUESTS
			Sha la la la
			That ain't no crime -
			That ain't no crime.

	At the end of number, ROCKY has climbed up the ladder attached to the 
	end of the tank nearest the bridal chambers and FRANK is in a heap 
	below.  RIFF RAFF is behind the tank and MAGENTA and COLUMBIA in their 
	positions in front of it.

74	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	FRANK picks himself up.  ROCKY is sitting at the top of the ladder above 
	him, with his perfect limbs near Frank's face.

					FRANK
			Well.  That's no way to
			behave on your first day out.

	ROCKY looks hurt.

			But as you're such an
			exceptional beauty I'm
			prepared to forgive.

	FRANK crosses behind ROCKY to stand next to RIFF RAFF behind the tank.

			I just love success.

					RIFF RAFF (edging up to Frank)
			He is a credit to your
			genius, Master.

					FRANK
			Yes.

					MAGENTA (Moving to tank from controls)
			A triumph of your vill.

					FRANK
			Yes.

					COLUMBIA (Who is on opposite side of tank)
			He's o.k.

					FRANK
			O.K?  (Moving out behind tank towards 
			Janet and Brad)  I think we can do a 
			little better than that.

			You.  (To Janet)  What do you think?

					JANET
			Well.  (She looks at Brad)  I don't 
			like men with...er, with too many, muscles.

					FRANK
			I didn't make him for you

	JANET nods hastily.  FRANK moves towards microphone.

			He carries the Charles Atlas seal of 
			approval....And he didn't even take 
			the lessons.

74A	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	SONG:		CHARLES ATLAS (Pt. 1)

	As FRANK starts to sing, MAGENTA & RIFF RAFF collect one of ROCKY's 
	presents, the vaulting horse, and place it in front of the podium.
	COLUMBIA leads ROCKY down from the ladder.

					FRANK
			A weakling weighing
			Ninety eight pounds
			Will get sand in his face
			When kicked to the ground.
			And soon in the gym (ROCKY sits on horse)
			With a determined chin
			The sweat from his pores
			As he works for his ca-ha-hause

	MAGENTA & RIFF RAFF now bring the weights.

					FRANK
			Will make him glisten - thank you -
			And gleam.
			And with massage
			And just a little bit of
			Ste-he-he-he-hem...(laughs)
			He'll be pink.
			And quite clean.

					FRANK
			He'll be a strong man -
			Oh honey -

					GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK.
			But the wrong man.

					FRANK
			He'll eat nutritious high protein
			And swallow raw eggs.
			Try to build up his shoulders,
			His chest, arms and legs.

			Such an effort -
			If he only knew of my plan.
			In just seven days,

					GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK
			I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an

	ROCKY throws down the weights and begins press ups.

					FRANK
			He'll do press-ups and chin-ups,
			Do the snatch, clean and jerk.

	FRANK crosses to JANET & BRAD

			He thinks dynamic tension
			Must be hard work.
			Such strenuous living
			I just don't understand.

	FRANK moves back to ROCKY who is still pressing up.

			When, in just seven days -
			Oh baby...(ROCKY jumps up.)

			I can make you
			A ma-a-a-a-an...(laugh).

75	INT.	LABORATORY: REFRIGERATOR	NIGHT

	The large refrigeration unit door slowly opens, falling like a 
	drawbridge.  Inside is a wall of ice and many CocaCola bottles.
	Through these bursts an icy EDDIE riding a Harley Davidson motor bike, 
	ex World War II, holding a Gibson guitar.

	Several guests are crushed to death.

					COLUMBIA
			Eddie!

					EDDIE
			Stay cool baby.

					JANET
			Who's Eddie?

					RIFF RAFF
			The delivery boy.

					MAGENTA
			His delivery wasn't good enough though.

	ROCKY looks terrified.

	JANET has fainted yet again.

	EDDIE comes to life.

76	SONG:		"WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO SATURDAY NIGHT"

					EDDIE
			Whatever happened to Saturday night
			When you dressed up sharp
			And you felt alright
			It don't seem the same since cosmic light
			Came into my life and I thought I was divine.

	COLUMBIA leaps on to the pillion seat.

			I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go
			And listen to the music on the radio.

	The MOTORCYCLISTS GUESTS remember only too well.

			A saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show
			And we climbed in the back
			And we really had a good time

	COLUMBIA rushes to the switchboard, flicks a lighting switch and all the 
	lights above the stairs start changing colour.

	The GUESTS go crazy and rock and roll all over the staircase.

	COLUMBIA dances with EDDIE.

	Even RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA step it out.

					ALL
			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul
			I really love that rock and roll
			(four times)

	EDDIE (more confident, less frozen) leaps onto the motorbike in a legs 
	apart guitar strumming pose.

	FRANK is getting furious.

	ROCKY is perplexed.

					EDDIE
			My head used to swim
			From the perfume I smelled.
			My hands kind of fumbled
			With her white plastic belt.
			I'd taster her baby pink lipstick,
			And that's when I'd melt.
			And she'd whisper in my ear,
			Tonight she really was mine.

			Get back in front and put
			Some hair oil on.
			Buddy Holly was singing
			His very last song.
			With your arms around your girl
			You tried to - ah - sing along
			It felt pretty good, whoo.
			Really had a good ti-i-ime.

	EDDIE slips onto the pedal starting the bike.  He takes off and roars 
	round the laboratory, even riding up and down the walls.

					ALL
			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul.
			I really love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul.
			I really love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul.
			You know I love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie
			Bless my soul.
			I really love that rock and roll.

	4 bars instrumental (saxophone)

	FRANK steals towards the fridge where he collects an ice pick, 
	innocently.

					ALL			EDDIE
			Hot patootie		HOT PATOOTIE -
			Bless my soul.		BLESS MY SO-O-OUL.
			I really love that rock and roll.

			Hot patootie		HOT PATOOTIE
			Bless my soul.		I LOVE THAT ROCK & ROLL.

			I really love that rock and roll.
							THAT ROCK AND ROO-AHOUL!

	On the last chorus FRANK rushes to EDDIE with the ice pick, in a 
	demented fury.

	THE GUESTS are unbelieving.

	COLUMBIA covers her face with her hands.

	EDDIE is dead.  FRANK walks away from his body unconcerned.

	JANET screams and screams.

	MAGENTA is very bored and picking up ice cubes and placing them in the

	RIFF RAFF drags EDDIE's dismembered body back into the fridge.

			And so perish all those who reject my love!

	ROCKY cowers in terror.

			Oh no, my little Adonis -
			You're much too beautiful to be destroyed.
			He had a certain naive charm - but no muscle.

	ROCKY flexes.

	FRANK is thrilled.

78	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

					FRANK
			But a deltoid
			And a bicep,

			In just seven days -
			Oh baby -

					GUESTS, RIFF RAFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK
			I can make you a

			I don't want no dissension
			Just dynamic tension.

	RIFF RAFF presses a button and a wall opens revealing a bridal suite 
	done out in black silk.

	The GUESTS shout their approval.

	The end of the SONG turns into Mendelssohn's wedding march and FRANK 
	leads ROCKY to his bridal chamber.

	The GUESTS throw confetti.

	BRAD and JANET look at each other in amazement.

			There are some people who say that life

			However, the sudden departure of their
			host and his creation (into the seclusion
			of his sombre bridal suite) had left them
			feeling both apprehensive and uneasy.
			A feeling which grew as the other guests
			'departed' and 'they' were shown to their

	There is a knock at the door.

	JANET sits p.

					JANET
			Who is it?  Who's there?

	BRAD's voice from behind the door.

					BRAD'S VOICE
			It's only me, Janet.

	She relaxes.

					JANET
			Oh, Brad, come in, darling.

	A silhouette enters and crosses to the bed.  It moves onto the bed
	behind the net curtain.

					JANET
			Oh Brad - Mmmm - Oh yes, my darling -
			what if...

					BRAD
			It's alright Janet.  Everything's going
			to be alright.

					JANET
			Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me
			switch on the light.

					BRAD
			No, don't do that.

					JANET
			Oh don't be so shy.

	She switches on the light to reveal FRANK.

					JANET
			YOU!

	FRANK sits up.

					FRANK
			I'm afraid so, Janet.  But isn't it nice?

	JANET beats his chest with her clenched fists.

					JANET
			You beast, you monster, what have you
			done with Brad?

					FRANK
			Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?

					JANET
			You tricked me - I wouldn't have -
			I've never - never

					FRANK
			I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it?
			In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable.
			Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.

	He re-commences making love to her.

					JANET
			Oh - Oh - no - stop - I mean help.
			I - Brad - Oh.
				(she shouts)
			Brad.

	FRANK places a finger on her lips.

					FRANK
			Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now.  
			Do you want him to see you like this?

					JANET
			Like this - like how?  It's your fault.
			You're to blame.
				(pause)
			I was saving myself.

	We see ROCKY chained to the bed sleeping.

	In the background RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA in laboratory.

	ROCKY stirs and makes a sound.

	RIFF RAFF walks across to the door and stares at the sleeping body.

	His eyes are full of hate.

	He looks at MAGENTA.

	She nods to him.

	He releases the chains.

	ROCKY stirs.

	RIFF RAFF picks up a candelabra from the bedside table and taunts ROCKY.

	ROCKY jumps out of the bed, terrified.

	RIFF RAFF pushes the candelabra in his face.

	ROCKY crashes through the laboratory and escapes.

	RIFF RAFF turns to MAGENTA who is now standing in the doorway.

	RIFF RAFF puts down the candelabra and they exchange a strange sign.

	BRAD opens it cautiously.

	A shadowy figure moves across the room to the bed.

				(distraught)
			Oh Brad, it's no good here.  It will
			destroy us.

	BRAD takes her hand.

					BRAD
			Don't worry Janet, we'll be away
			from here in the morning.  Hmmmm,
			you smell so good.

	He gently lays her down on the bed and attempts to caress her.

					JANET
			Oh Brad.  Oh no.  Not till after
			the wedding, Darling.

	BRAD sits up.

					BRAD
			Alright, Janet.  I understand.

	The shadow rolls over.

					JANET
			Maybe we could try it this way.

					BRAD
				(surprised)
			Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet.
			Everything's going to be alright.

					JANET
			I hope so my darling.

	BRAD reaches out to the light.

			No, don't put on the l...

	BRAD switches on the bedside lamp an realises he is making love to
	FRANK wearing a JANET wig.

					BRAD
			You!

					FRANK
			I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?

	BRAD grabs FRANK around the throat.

					BRAD
			Why you - what have you done with Janet?

					FRANK
			Nothing.  Why do you think I should?

	BRAD lets him go and turns away humiliated.

					BRAD
			You tricked me.  I wouldn't have -
			I've never - never.

					FRANK
			I know, but it wasn't all bad was it?
			I think you found it quite pleasurable.
				(he caresses Brad)
			Oh so soft.  So sensual.

					BRAD
			Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.
				(shouts)
			Janet.

					FRANK
			Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now.
			Do you want her to see you like this?

					BRAD
			Like this.
				(throwing Frank aside)
			Like how?  It's your fault - you're to
			blame.  I thought it was the real thing.

					FRANK
			Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was
			enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime
			in giving yourself over to pleasure.

					FRANK (Switches off light)
			Oh Brad, you have wasted so much time
			already.  Janet needn't know, I won't tell her.

					BRAD
			You promise you won't tell?

			On my mother's grave.

	Suddenly the shadows are illuminated by the monitor as an image of

	JANET is pacing around the tank which is covered by a cloth.  She

	ROCKY HORROR looks miserable.

					JANET
			Yes.  There you see it's instinctive.

	JANET rips another piece off her fast vanishing petticoat.

	During the next verse she bandages ROCKY.

					JANET
			Now all I want to know

			The transducer (He slams the handle)
			Will seduce yah.

	DR. SCOTT, BRAD & JANET find they are stuck to the floor.

					JANET
			My feet - I can' move my feet.

					DR. SCOTT
			My wheels - My God, I can't
			move my wheels.

					BRAD
			It's as if we were glued to the spot.

					FRANK
			You are - so quake with fear,
			you tiny fools.

					JANET
			We're trapped.

					FRANK (Moving to her)
			It's something you'll
			Get used to.
			A mental mind fuck
			Can be nice.

					JANET
			Oh!

	FRANK climbs up the ladder beside the tank.

	(music under this dialogue)

					DR. SCOTT
			You won't find earth people quite
			the easy mark you imagine.  This
			sonic transducer - it is, I suppose,
			some kind of audio-vibratory,
			physiomolecular transport device....

					BRAD
			You mean...

					DR. SCOTT
			Yes Brad.  It's something we ourselves
			have been working on.  But it
			seems our friend here has found a
			way of perfecting it.  A device
			which is capable of breaking down
			solid matter and then projecting it
			through space, and - who knows -
			perhaps even time itself!

					JANET
			You mean he's gonna send us to
			another planet?

	FRANK leaps off the tank to the floor.

					FRANK
			Planet.

			Schmanet.

			Janet.

	FRANK circles JANET, testing her thighs.  BRAD struggles in vain.

					FRANK
			You'd better wise up,
			Janet Weiss.
			You'd better wise up,
			Build your thighs up.
			You'd better wise up.

145	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT

					NARRATOR
			Then she cries out -

146	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	SONG:		"HOT DOG"

	JANET screams out.

					JANET
			Sto-o-o-o-o-op.

	She cried so loudly that FRANK staggers backwards towards the control
	panel.

	RIFF RAFF & MAGENTA enter through the hole in the tiles - they march
	to behind the tank and then the control panel.

					FRANK (singing)
			Don't get hot and flustered -
			Use a bit of mustard.

					BRAD
			You're a hot dog
			But you'd better not
			Try to hurt her,
			Frank Furter.

	FRANK signals to MAGENTA.

	BCS MAGENTA's hand on the transducer switch.

	BRAD is turned into a statute.

					DR. SCOTT
			You're a hot dog
			But you'd better not
			Try to hurt her,
			Frank Furter.

	FRANK signals, cut to the switch as it is turned on.

	DR. SCOTT is a statue.

					JANET
			You're a hot dog...

	FRANK signals.  C.S. SWITCH.

	JANET is stone.

147	INT.	LABORATORY	NIGHT

	DIALOGUE SEQUENCE.

					COLUMBIA
			My God!  I can't take any more of this - 
			first you spurn me for Eddie, then you 
			cast him off like an old overcoat for 
			Rocky.  You chew people up and then spit 
			them out - I loved you, do you hear me - 
			I LOVED YOU - And what did it get me - 
			I'll tell you - a big nothing.
			You're like a sponge.  You take, take, 
			take, take!  You drain others of their 
			love and emotions.  Well, I've had enough.  
			You've got to choose between me and Rocky - 
			so named because of the rocks in his head.

	FRANK throws a switch, she turns to stone.

					FRANK
			It's not easy having a good time.

	He crosses over to RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA

			Even smiling makes my face ache.

	RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA nod sympathetically.

	He lies on the operating table.

	They massage.

					FRANK
			My children turn on me.  Rocky's behaving
			just as Eddie did.  Maybe I made a mistake
			in splitting his brain between the two of
			them.

					MAGENTA
				(massaging his temples)
			When will we return to Transylvania?
			I grow weary of this world.

					FRANK
			Magenta, I am indeed grateful to both
			you and your brother RIff Raff - you have
			both served me well - loyalty such as
			yours must be rewarded and you will
			discover when the mood takes me I can
			be quite generous.

	MAGENTA betrays her resentment by digging her fingernails into his neck.

					MAGENTA
			I ask for nothing, Master.

	FRANK leaps up from the table.

					FRANK
			And you shall receive it - in abundance.
				(he goes to the lift)
			Come.  We are ready for the floor show.
				(he slams the lift gate)
			Our guests will be growing restless.

	The lift moves downwards.

	Left alone in the laboratory MAGENTA and RIFF RAFF smile at each other.

	They make a special sign and leave by a secret passageway.

								WIPE TO

148	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT

					NARRATOR
			And so, by some extraordinary coincidence - 
			fate it seems had decided that Brad and 
			Janet should keep that appointment with 
			their friend Dr Everett Scott.  But it was 
			to be in a situation which none of them 
			could have possibly foreseen.  And just a 
			few hours after announcing their engagement, 
			Brad and Janet had both tasted forbidden 
			fruit.  This in itself was proof that their 
			host was a man of little morals - and some 
			persuasion.  What further indignities were 
			they to be subjected to?  And what of the 
			sonic transducer and floor show that had 
			been spoken of?  What indeed?  From what 
			had gone before, it was clear that this 
			was to be no picnic.

								WIPE TO

149	INT.	BALLROOM (including STAGE)	NIGHT

	MUSIC:	"THE FLOOR SHOW"

	We see the stage at the end of the ballroom with red velvet curtains.

150	BACKSTAGE	NIGHT

	FRANK is enjoying dressing the statues which are now on stage.  Each one
	is lovingly fitted with extravagant variations on the stocking and
	suspender belt variety of his own fantasies.

151	INT.	BALLROOM (INCLUDING STAGE)	NIGHT

	Footlights glowing on the curtains.

								CUT TO

152	INT.	BACKSTAGE	NIGHT

	FRANK pulls a switch and the curtains open.

	Red velvet curtains open to reveal statues in front of silver drapes.
	The floor is covered with a light mist.

								CUT TO

154	INT.	BACKSTAGE	NIGHT

	FRANK beams and pulls lever.

								CUT TO

155	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	COLUMBIA's statue comes to life.

					COLUMBIA
			It was great when it all began
			I was a regular Frank fan.
			But it was over when he had the plan
			To start working on a muscle-man.
			Now the only thing that gives me hope
			Is my love of a certain dope
			Rose tints my world keeps me
			Safe from my trouble and pain.

								CUT TO

					ROCKY
			I'm just seven hours old
			Truly beautiful to behold
			And somebody should be told
			My libido hasn't been controlled
			Now the only thing I've come to trust
			Is an orgasmicÊrush of lust
			Rose tints my world keeps me
			Safe from my trouble and pain.

	BRAD animated by FRANK

								CUT TO

158	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

					BRAD
			It's beyond me
			Help me Mommy
			I'll be good you'll see
			Take this dream away
			What's this, let's see
			I feel sexy
			What's come over me
			Here it comes again.

								CUT TO

159	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	JANET animates.  She behaves like a sex goddess, completely out of
	control, as if performing in a burlesque show.

					JANET
			I feel released
			Bad times deceased
			My confidence increased
			Reality is here
			The game has been disbanded
			My mind has been expanded
			It's a gas that Frankie's landed
			His lust is so sincere.

160	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	We PULL BACK on the whole stage.  The velvets open to reveal the 20th
	Century Fox logo as a stage set.

	At the top of the staircase FRANK appears bathed in light.

	He wears a dazzling version of the national costume and a chiffon cloak
	which billows in the breeze from a wind machine.  He is reminiscent of
	a 30's film star.

					FRANK
			What ever happened to Fay Wray
			That delicate satin-draped frame
			As it clung to her thigh
			How I started to cry
			For I wanted to be dressed just the same.

								CUT TO

161	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	The floor opens to reveal a swimming pool glistening with chlorine
	and glitter.  He beckons the GUESTS.

	In their drugged state they comply with his every wish.


					FRANK
			Give yourself over to absolutely pleasure
			Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh
			Erotic nightmares
			Beyond any measure
			And sensual daydreams
			To treasure forever.

	FRANK enters the pool.

			Can't you just see it.
			Can't you just see it.

	They begin to immerse themselves in the pool.

161A			Don't dream it.  Be it.

					ALL
			Don't dream it.  Be it.

	DR SCOTT animates belatedly.

	He observes the orgy occurring in the pool.

					DR. SCOTT
			Ach, we've got to get out of this trap
			before this decadence saps our wills.
			I've got to be strong and try to hang
			on.  Or else my mind, may well snap.

	The wind machine blows the blanked from his lap and we see legs, 
	stockings and a suspender belt.  As in a miracle he can walk again.

					DR. SCOTT
			Und my life will be lived,
			For the thri-i-i-i-ill...

	BRAD surfaces, his face betraying consternation.

					BRAD
			It's beyond me
			Help me Mo-ommy.

	He is pulled back into the pool.

	A thrilled JANET now emerges.

					JANET
			God bless Lilly Saint Cyr.

	FRANK breaks through the water on a lift from ROCKY.

	SONG:		FLOOR SHOW PT. 3 - WILD AND UNTAMED THING.

					FRANK
			My my my my
			I'm a wild and an untamed thing.
			I'm a bee with a deadly sting.
			Get a hit and your mind goes ping.
			Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing.
			So let the party and the sounds rock on.
			Gonna shake it till the life has gone.

			Rose tint my world
			Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.

	FRANK dives into the pool.

	During the chorus the whole group are diving in and out of the pool in
	a frenetic water ballet.

					ALL
			I'm a wild and an untamed thing
			I'm a bee with a deadly sting.
			Get a hit and your mind goes ping
			Your heart'll thump and your blood will sing.

	They emerge from the pool and form a kick line.

			So let the part and the sounds rock on
			Gonna shake it till the life has gone.
			Rose tint my world
			Keep me safe from my trouble and pain.

162	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

	The doors at the opposite end of the ballroom open.

	SONG:		"RIFF RAFF'S RECIT"

	RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA now dressed in military style space suits, face
	FRANK from the opposite end of the ballroom.

	They applaud slowly.

	RIFF RAFF has a ray gun.

	The characters on stage freeze - terrified.

	It's a showdown across the ballroom.

					RIFF RAFF
			Frank N. Furter
			It's all over
			Your mission is a failure.

	FRANK looks stunned.

			Your life style's too extreme.

	FRANK is guilt-stricken.

			I'm your new Commander.
			You are now my prisoner.

	The GUESTS scramble for the safety of the wings.

			We return to Transylvania
				(he turns to Magenta)
			Prepare the transit beam.

	MAGENTA turns to leave.

					FRANK
			Wait!  I can explain.

163	INT.	STAGE	NIGHT

	SONG:		"I'M COMING HOME"

	FRANK moves slowly to centre stage.  During the song he adjusts 
	footlight controls to give him what effects he requires.

	The others help FRANK out by singing from the wings.  COLUMBIA operates
	a spotlight.

	BRAD closes silver curtains.

					FRANK
			On the day I went away.

					GUESTS
			Goodbye

					FRANK
			Was all I had to say

					GUESTS
			Now I

					FRANK
			Want to come again and stay

					GUESTS
			Oh my, my,

					FRANK
			Smile and that will mean I may

	He kicks on cloud projection.  Blue skies appear.

					FRANK
			I've seen blue skies
			Through the tears in my eyes
			And I realise
			I'm going home
			I'm going home

	FRANK falls on his knees.

			Everywhere it's been the same

					GUESTS
			Feeling

					FRANK
			Like I'm outside in the rain

					GUESTS
			Wheeling

					FRANK
			Free to try and find a game

					GUESTS
			Dealing

					FRANK
			Cards for sorrow,
			Cards for pain.

	DR SCOTT switches on wind machine.

			I've seen blue skies
			Through the tears in my eyes
			And I realise
			I'm going home
			I'm going home.
			I'm going home.

164	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

	MAGENTA who during all this has been filing her nails, looks up at FRANK
	who is in an attitude of supplication.

					MAGENTA
			How sentimental.

	RIFF RAFF moves slowly to the stage.

					RIFF RAFF
			And also presumptuous of you.  You
			see when I said "we" were to return
			to Transylvania, I referred only to
			Magenta and myself.

	FRANK looks appalled.

	The GUESTS are deeply troubled, realising that they also are not part of
	the "We".

					RIFF RAFF
			You see, you are to remain here,
			in spirit anyway.

	He produces a ray gun.

					DR SCOTT
			Great Heavens, that's a laser.

					RIFF RAFF
			Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of
			emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.

					BRAD
			You mean you're going to kill him?
			What's his crime?

					DR SCOTT
			You saw what became of Eddie.
			Society must be protected.

					RIFF RAFF
			Exactly, Dr Scott.  Now Frank N.
			Furter, your time has come.  Say
			goodbye to all this and hello to oblivion.

	FRANK raises himself to his full height.

					FRANK
			Do your worse - inferior one.

	As RIFF RAFF pulls the trigger, COLUMBIA dashes between them.

	She is killed instantly.

	RIFF RAFF fires again at FRANK.

	FRANK takes a leap fro the rope on the curtain.  The entire proscenium 
	crashes under the weight.  And FRANK is crushed to death among the
	velvet and glittered facia.

	ROCKY breaks down completely.  Although he despised FRANK, he was all he
	had in the world.

	He rushes to the body and cradles it in his arms.

	RIFF RAFF can stand no more.

	He fires a blast of laser beam at ROCKY who starts climbing the stairway
	towards the fox skyline.

	RIFF RAFF fires again and again.

	With the body of FRANK in his arms, ROCKY beats on his chest and lets
	out a wild sound like a giant beast of the jungle.

	RIFF RAFF fires a sustained beam.

	ROCKY climbs to the top of the Fox sculpture.

	RIFF RAFF fires again and again.

	They crash to their deaths.

					BRAD
			Good God.

					RIFF RAFF
			Yes.

					JANET
			You've killed them.

	MAGENTA has found the entire sequence of events quite distasteful.

					MAGENTA
			I thought you liked them.  They liked you.

					RIFF RAFF
			They didn't like me.  They never liked me.

					DR SCOTT
				(he tries a calming hand)
			You did right.

					RIFF RAFF
			A decision had to be made.

					DR SCOTT
				(the big sell-out)
			You're OK by me.

					RIFF RAFF
			Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.

					DR SCOTT
			Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.

					RIFF RAFF
			You must leave now Dr Scott while it's
			still possible.  We are about to beam
			the entire house back to the planet of
			transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania.
			Go now.

	The GUESTS flee down the ballroom and out the door.

	We see the laughing figures of RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA making a special
	sign to each other.

								CUT TO

165	INT.	CASTLE CORRIDORS	NIGHT

	We see BRAD and JANET fleeing with DR SCOTT following behind.

165A	INT.	BALLROOM	NIGHT

	RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA's laughter has subsided.

					RIFF RAFF
			Our noble mission is almost completed my
			most beautiful sister, soon we will return
			to the moon-drenched shores of our
			"androgenous" planet.

					MAGENTA
			Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night -
			to sing and dance once more to your dark
			refrains.  To take that step to the right...

					RIFF RAFF
			But it's the pelvic thrust
			that really drives you insane.

					MAGENTA
			And our World will do
			the Time Warp again.

165B	EXT.	CASTLE	DAWN

	There is a huge explosion.

166	EXT.	CASTLE	DAWN

	We see the entire castle surrounded by a giant beam of light and then
	vanish into space.

	During the explosion sequence the film reverts optically to black and
	white.

								DISSOLVE TO

167	EXT.	THE CRATER	DAY

	SONG:		"SUPER-HEROES"

	BRAD, JANET, and DR SCOTT's bodies are scattered on three sides
	surrounding a crater where the castle once was.

	The scene is arid and deserted.  There are remnants of DR SCOTT's
	wheelchair, EDDIE's coffin and broken objects from the laboratory.

	BRAD, tattered and bleeding, lifts himself up.

					BRAD
			I've done a lot
			God knows I've tried
			To find the truth I've even lied
			But all I know is down inside.

	DR SCOTT drags himself to his knees.

					BRAD & DR SCOTT
			I'm bleeding.

					JANET
				(revives)
			And super heroes
			Come to feast
			To taste the flesh
			Not yet deceased
			And al I know
			Is still the beast

					TRIO
			Is feeding.

	The three of them stand shakily on the perimeter of the crater.

	All that is left is dust and sand and wind and the sun.

	The CAMERA PANS from face to face in a circular movement getting faster
	and faster as the trio sing a chorale of hopelessness.

								DISSOLVE TO

168	INT.	STUDY	NIGHT

	The CAMERA has spun into a blur but focusses on a spinning globe
	of the earth on the NARRATOR's desk.

	The NARRATOR puts his hand on the globe, stopping it.

	He is standing over his lectern reading from his book like a preacher
	in a pulpit.

					NARRATOR
			And crawling on the planet's face
			Some insects called the human race
			Lost in time, and lost in space
			And meaning.

	He turns and goes to the door of the study.

	He switches off the light.

					VOICES OFF
			Meaning.

	He leaves the study, shutting the door.

	It's almost dark in the study.  Only a sinister glow inside the globe
	of the earth remains.

169	CREDIT SEQUENCE

	SONG:		"SCIENCE FICTION, DOUBLE-FEATURE"

	The cast credits roll up.

					VOICE OVER
			Science Fiction - double-feature
			Frank has built and lost his creature
			Darkness has conquered Brad and Janet
			The servants gone to a distant planet
			Oh - at the late night double-feature
			Picture Show - I want to go - Ohh -
			To the late night double-feature picture show.

				MICHAEL WHITE PRODUCTIONS LTD
				-----------------------------
				THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW
				-----------------------------

					Script Amendments			September 12, 1974
					-----------------

The following alterations involve discrepancies between the original 
screenplay and current script revisions and design decisions.

1/2	The film will now commence in Black and White on "ACADEMY"
	format.  It will extend to wide screen (1.1 - 85) at
	Sequence 41, while still remaining in black and white.  At
	Sequence 54 the film changes to colour.

15	Now read "Denton Episcopalian Church".

23	Brad and Janet will arrive at the gate entrance to Oakley Court.
	This deletes a later reference to gates in 33.  From hereon ignore
	all references to rock formations etc., as the grounds of
	Oakley Court are the only location involved in the approach to the
	house.

25	Three motorbikes drive past Brad and disappear around the house.

26	This window will be in turret in Oakley Court.  Ignore all
	references to adjoining 'massive lighted window'.

30	This shot will be of a Gryphem on the Oakley Court facade.

32	This will be of some similar detail to the above.

38	"Stairway" references now allude to the front entrance hall of
	Oakley Court.

40	Delete references to "mirrors reflecting to infinity".

47	Columbia now is astride a Juke Box.  The band are cut.

54a	Red streamers and Black and White balloons fall.  Not just
	streamers.

69	All future references to the operating table in the Lab now
	should be applied either to the TANK or the vaulting horse
	(part of the gymnasium equipment) - whichever is applicable.

75	Delete references to the Ice-block.  Eddie now crashes
	through a wall of Coca Cola bottles and ice.  He is also equipped
	with a saxaphone rather than a guitar.

87a	Rocky now escapes through the lift shaft.  This may involve
	a shot from the vestibule showing Rocky climbing out of lift
	cage and running out of the house.  It may also involve the
	double bed in the bridal suite collapsing during the escape
	sequence.

91	It is still raining.

92	Janet is now stumbling around the staircase in Oakley Court.

103	This sequence may now also involve Riff-Raff, Magenta,
	Columbia, Frank, Brad and selected Transylvanians.

106	Will now have Frank, Riff-Raff, and Brad entering the Lab
	in the lift cage.

108	It is still raining.

116	Dr Scott will now break through the tiled wall of the laboratory
	on the area of ramp above the control panel.

117	Magenta will now appear through the broken tile area created
	by Dr Scott.

122/140 This sequence will be altered to Dr Scott holding a
	photograph album containing a still photograph equivalent
	of the "flashbacks" referred to in this sequence.

143/4	All entrances to the Lab will be via the broken tiled entrance.

	Delete all references to the floor lowering.

147	The "secret passage" is now the broken tile entrance.

164	Frank tries to scale up the silver drapes which descend on
	him with Tab tracks, rope supports, etc.

MEMO:  SCRIPT ALTERATIONS

FROM:  JIM SHARMAN				9.12.74

TO:    ALL CONCERNED.


Sc. 148  INT. NARRATOR'S STUDY.N>

As scripted up to;  What further indignities were they
to be subjected to?

Then please add:	And what of the floor show that had been
spoken of?  In an empty house?  In the middle of the night.
What diabolical plan had seized Frank's crazed imagination?
What indeed?  From what had gone before it was clear that
this was to be no picnic.


Sc. 97.  INT. NARRATOR'S STUDY.  N.

Is replaced by the following:

Emotion is a powerful and irrational master, and, from what
Magenta and Columbia eagerly viewed on their television
monitor there seemed little doubt that Janet was indeed it's
slave.


SC. 77 pt.

C.S. FRANK				FRANK
			Oh no my baby - don't be upset -
			it was a mercy killing.  He had
			a certain naive charm - but no muscle.
