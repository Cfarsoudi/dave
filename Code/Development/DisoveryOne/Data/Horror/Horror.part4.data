                                                 November 1, 1987


FADE IN:

1    TITLES

The screen is composed of large, straight-edge areas of black
and white that rest against each other in a manner that suggests
some kind of pattern, without making a final sense; it is as if
we are too close to something that, could we see it from a
distance, would be clear to us.

These areas shift and change - both their own shape and their
relationship to their neighbors.  New patterns are being made,
new solutions found - but they are just beyond our comprehension.
The effect should be aesthetically pleasing but simultaneously
frustrating and, perhaps, a little unsettling.

Shortly into this sequence, and subsequently inter-cut
throughout, we begin to see, in FLASHBACK, the story of
HELLRAISER.  Arriving first as very short shock-images, these
brief sections eventually convey to the audience all the
necessary emotional and narrative information they will need to
understand the background to HELLBOUND.

Meanwhile, the black and white shapes are still moving, the
unseen patterns still shifting.

Over this constantly mobile background, the TITLES begin to
appear.

As the TITLES unroll, another change comes over the puzzle pieces
behind them.  Where before they moved and related only in two
dimensions, gradually we see that they are now claiming depth as
well.  The puzzle we are looking at is now a three-dimensional
one.  The pieces are now solid blocks of various geometric
shapes, locking together, moving apart, finding their final
position.

Finally, as the TITLES come to their conclusion, the camera pulls
back until we can see clearly what we have been looking at.  As
the final piece clicks into positions we see it is THE LAMENT
CONFIGURATION from HELLRAISER.

The closed box rests before our eyes a moment and then the circle
in the centre of the side that faces us gives way to an image
of a dusty street with a market. Simultaneous to this, the camera
TRACKS into this image until it fills the screen


2    EXT   A STREET BAZAAR   DAY

The TRACK continues up through the market and then turns through
the stalls to find a store behind them. As we TRACK through the
store's doorway, we pass through a beaded curtain that
momentarily reminds us of the TORTURE ROOM in HELLRAISER.


3   INT.   STORE   DAY

Once we are in the store itself, though, this impression disappears.
It is an ordinary, slightly seedy, junk shop.

The stall seems to sell an odd mixture of items; native trinkets
share space with second-hand items from European colonists. These
second-hand goods give us some sense of period. They suggest the
late 'twenties/early 'thirties. This is reinforced by the
sounds coming from one of them, an old-fashioned mahogany-cased
wireless. A foreign voice speaks from it in a language we don't
understand, though perhaps the words "BBC world service" are
discerned in the middle, and then a dance-hall tune of the period
begins to play. (Depending on availability, it would be nice to
have something relevant - 'I'll follow my Secret Heart', perhaps,
or 'Dancing in the Dark'.)

Into shot comes an ENGLISH OFFICER. His uniform, too, suggests
the 'twenties, the last days of Empire. He is tall, thin, and
dark-haired, but at no stage do we see his face clearly. He
stands in front of the stall.

The TRADER suddenly stands behind the counter. He has been
crouched beneath it, as if checking or preparing something. He
is a big, impressive-looking black man. His face is totally
impassive as he stares at his customer.

Neither of the men speak. Obviously, a deal has already been
struck and today is the pay-off.

The OFFICER, a little arrogantly - suggesting racist contempt,
slaps down a bag of gold on the stall's counter.

Keeping his eyes firmly on the OFFICER, he reaches beneath him
and brings something up from under the counter and places it In
the OFFICER'S outstretched hand. He is holding a LAMENT
CONFIGURATION.

The OFFICER turns and leaves. The camera TRACKS out of the store,
looking at the TRADER as he watches the departing OFFICER.


4    INT   THE OFFICER'S QUANSETT HUT   DAY

It is typical of temporary military quarters, complete with a
curved ceiling of corrugated material. It is stripped of furniture.
The blinds are down.

The OFFICER, still in uniform, sits cross-legged, the BOX held
before him.

He is already well into the solving process and very soon after
the shot begins the BOX begins to speed its own solution.

Finally, two sections of the BOX shoot upwards and begin to peel
apart from each other, ready to reveal its secret.

The OFFICER, suddenly nervous, drops the BOX and scuttles back
across the floor to stare at it. The BOX lands upright, its
extended parts still open above it. For a beat of two, nothing
happens. We become aware of the OFFICER'S pulse, throbbing
excitedly on the soundtrack.


5    INT   THE OFFICER'S QUANSETT HUT   DAY    OFFICER'S P.O.V.

Slowly we, the camera, and the OFFICER, move towards the still,
silent, but menacing BOX.

We approach it until finally we are above it, looking down into
the opening it has made in itself. There is undefined movement
inside.

Suddenly, something flies up directly at us. We glimpse it only
briefly, but enough to see its nature. Unlike the hooks that
flaw at FRANK in HELLRAISER, this is more organic than metallic.
Pink and flesh-like but on a long gray-blue stalk, it
flies upward, its lips peeling apart gapingly to reveal scores of
yellow, discoloured, and viciously sharp teeth-like hooks.

The OFFICER screams and the screen begins to take on a red tint
so that, just as the thing is about to fill the screen
with its hungry mouth, the entire screen turns red.

The red screen is held for a second and then suddenly becomes
complete blackness.


6    INT   BLACK SPACE

The black screen continues and, rising slowly from it and falling
back slowly into it, in a dream-like, surrealistic manner, come
various images of the OFFICER'S torment/pleasure in Hell.

By various camera tricks, such as step-printing or optical
blurring, his face is still not clearly seen, but is seen enough
for us to see his sensual, almost orgasmic responses to what is
being done to him.

Cuts appear spontaneously across his face, leaving a grid like
crisscross pattern of wounds.

Finally, a disembodied hand gripping a hammer drives nails into
each corner formed by these wounds and, as the face comes into
full view for the first time, we realize who this is. It is
PINHEAD from HELLRAISER.

PINHEAD'S completed face floats on the blackness and stares out
at us.

                            PINHEAD
                        (echoed & slow)
                  Kirsty, come to daddy

The tiny silence following PINHEAD's words is shattered by a
piercing and terrified scream.


7    INT   HOSPITAL ROOM    NIGHT

The scream continues, but the blackness is replaced by KIRSTY's
anguished face; it is she who is screaming. The scream subsides,
replaced by breathless panting accompanied by rapid eye movement.

                            RONSON
                         (off camera)
                  Ah, you're awake. Good.

We pull out to see that KIRSTY is sitting up, fully dressed, on a
hospital bed. RONSON, a police detective, sits on a plain wooden
chair, which is the only other piece of furniture in the room.
The walls are bare save for a piece of primitive art on one wall,
and, on another, a circular barred window looking out.

RONSON stands up and walks to the foot of the bed. He rests his
hand on the bed's metal frame and smiles a perfunctory smile.

                            RONSON
                  Tell you what - we'll make a
                  deal. I'll tell you what I
                  know, then you tell me what
                  you know.  O.K.?

KIRSTY is still re-orienting herself. She blinks a few times
and then focuses on RONSON's hands gripping the bed.

                            RONSON
                  O.K.?

KIRSTY looks up at RONSON's face and then around at the room.

                            KIRSTY
                  Where am I?

                            RONSON
                  You're in the Malahide Institute.
                  It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey,
                  don't feel judged - it was just
                  the nearest place to bring you.
                  Remember? You and your boyfriend... ?

                            KIRSTY
                  Steve...

                            RONSON
                  Don't worry. He's O.K.  We sent him
                  home hours ago.  Jeez, what a story.

He puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it.

                            RONSON
                  What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust?
                  Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?

                            KIRSTY
                  What are you talking about?  Who
                  are you?

                            RONSON
                  Oh, excuse me...

RONSON reaches in his jacket and flashes an I.D.

                            RONSON
                  Ronson.  Homicide.  I'm this
                  district's slash and dash expert.
                  Made a career of the nasty ones.
                  That's why I was at your
                  Dad's house.  Jesus, what a mess.

KIRSTY'S eyes prick with tears. She looks away from RONSON.

                            KIRSTY (to herself)
                  Daddy...


8    INT   JUNK ROOM LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT

CORTEZ, a POLICE OFFICER, shifts some unpacked crates to
allow a closer look at the shriveled and deformed corpse of one
of FRANK and JULIA'S victims.

                            CORTEZ
                  Jesus...

CORTEZ prods at the corpse with his night-stick, attempting
to turn it over. A stream of maggots pours from the mouth and
the cavity that used to be its throat.

CORTEZ jumps back in disgust and knocks against one of the
several wardrobes in the cluttered room.  Another corpse flies
out at him, as decayed and flvblown as the first.

CORTEZ draws his gun and empties it blowing the corpses
head off, scattering flesh, mucus, and bone - but no blood -
everywhere before realizing it is already dead.

He realises what he has done and lowers his weapon sheepishly.

                            CORTEZ
                  Oh. shit...


9   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   DAY

RONSON is sitting back in the chair, looking at the now slightly
calmer KIRSTY.

                            RONSON
                  We got two missing people
                  and a house full of corpses.

He holds out his hand towards KIRSTY in a theatrical manner.

                            RONSON
                  Talk to me.

KIRSTY swings her legs off the bad, but remains sitting on it,
her feet on the floor. She doesn't look directly at RONSON but
begins to take in the (few) details of the room for the first
time.

                            KIRSTY
                  I thought Steve had talked
                  to you?

                            RONSON
                  Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't
                  convey my hesitation to take his
                  story at face-value. No, YOU
                  talk to me. But - do me a favor? -
                  none of this DEMONS crap.

KIRSTY closes her eyes, almost wincing, as memory comes.

KIRSTY opens her eyes. Consciously, she slows the rhythm of the
dialogue down.

                            KIRSTY
                  He talked about Demons, huh?

                            RONSON
                  Yeah.

KIRSTY turns her head to look directly at RONSON.

                            KIRSTY
                  It's true. All of it. It's all true.

RONSON stares at her, impressed by her conviction and intensity.
There is a second of shared silence.

Suddenly, a shocking ELECTRONIC CRACKLE shatters the mood. RONSON
starts, then realises it is the radio at his belt. He snatches it
up and speaks into it.

                            RONSON
                  Ronson.

10    INT   BEDROOM  LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT

Another OFFICER, KUCICH, is standing, radio in hand, by the
blood-stained mattress. CORTEZ stands beside him, gun now safely
re-holstered.

                            KUCICH
                  Kucich here,sir.  We just found another one,
                  though it suffered a little...

KUCICH looks at CORTEZ, who looks embarrassed.

                            KUCICH
                  ...er, accidental damage in discovery.
                  Anyway, just about the only portable
                  evidence we've got here - apart from
                  human remains - is the mattress. Looks
                  like someone was messed up real bad
                  on it.


11    INT   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

                            KUCICH
                         (off-camera)
                  Can we send it downtown?

RONSON throws KIRSTY a look of exasperation with his colleague.
The camera stays on KIRSTY's face as RONSON speaks.

                            RONSON
                  What the hell are you asking me
                  for?  Tag it.  Move it.

                            KIRSTY (to herself)
                  The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.

Without waiting for a reply, RONSON switches the radio off and
clips it back to his belt.


12    INT   BEDROOM   55 STREET   NIGHT
We are looking at the mattress. KUCICH has left the room.

CORTEZ draws a pad from his packet. The pad is stapled, and
the staple has been badly inserted and is not closed property.
In the act of tearing a label from the pad, CORTEZ catches
his thumb on the staple.

                            OFFICER
                  Shit!

The label is adhesive-backed. CORTEZ licks it and presses
it on the mattress. He writes on it - 55L/E1.  As he stands up
from doing this, a single drop of blood from his thumb lands on
the mattress. (It is important that we see it is only a single
drop - and nothing like the amount LARRY spilled on the
floorboards.)

CORTEZ leaves the room to fetch a colleague to help him
move the mattress.  We move in to see the drop of blood disappear
very quickly into the mattress, as if it is being sucked in.

As this happens, we hear on the soundtrack the faintest RUMBLE.


13    INT   OPERATING ROOM   NIGHT

A somewhat antiquated and frightening operating room, filled
with machines, monitors, and surgical instruments. The corners of
the room fall away to shadow.

Sitting upright in the centre of the room is a FEMALE PATIENT.
She is awake and staring out at the camera.  Twin probes/clamps
are in each of her ears to hold her in place.  Her head is shaved
and the skin on the back of her head has been cut open and peeled
apart.  The flaps of the skin are held away from the area being
worked on by four clamps. (we never actually see round to the
exposed brain itself)

Immediately behind her, and probing with professional skill and
coolness into her exposed brain, is DOCTOR MALAHIDE.  He is in
his late forties and looks like all the great doctors look -
rational, civilized, competent, and powerful.  There is an
intensity in his eyes and the lines  of his face though that
suggests something more than normal.

The room has several attentive listeners and observers, but the
one nearest to MALAHIDE is his personal student/assistant KYLE
MACRAE, young, conventionally good-looking, with an open,
friendly, face.

MALAHIDE is holding forth on the secrets of his trade, several times
looking away from his patient while still working on her, to make
sure his audience understand his points.

                            MALAHIDE
                  We can bring them back properly
                  more often than scientific orthodoxy
                  dictates, ladies and gentlemen.  And
                  the knife, far from the enemy of
                  of analysis, is often its greatest
                  ally in solving the puzzles of
                  psychosis. Analysis isolates and
                  massages. Surgery pinpoints and
                  corrects. ... though you've got to
                  know what you're doing, of course...

Polite laughter from several students.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Some things are obvious. Here,
                  for example, ...

He prods in at a specific area.

                            MALAHIDE
                  ...are the optical motor nerve
                  control centers.

The PATIENT begins to blink in time with MALAHIDE'S prodding.
The affect is half-comical, half-distressing.  Perhaps MALAHIDE
carries it on just that half-second too long for innocent
demonstration.  But the students give impressed murmurs anyway.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Now. This case. A deeply-buried
                  psychosis severe enough to produce
                  frighteningly frequent hysteria and
                  aggression. Incurable. Say others. Not so.
                  Analysis isolates. The knife
                  exposes. Medication controls.

As he speaks, MALAHIDE injects a syringe directly into the
PATIENT's brain. Her face spasms momentarily.

MALAHIDE stands back slightly. His face is serene, calm, and
confident.

He takes a small, motorised drill and sets to work on the brain.

                            MALAHIDE
                  And then, ladies and gentlemen, we
                  REBUILD. With all the care and
                  knowledge that our years of training
                  have given us ...

He looks around at them all, smiling slightly.

                            MALAHIDE

                  ... WE BRING THEM BACK.

The students murmur their approval. Perhaps they even applaud.
MALAHIDE acknowledges their reaction with a modest nod.

Suddenly, an intercom on the wall cuts in.

                            INTERCOM
                  Dr. Malahide, the new arrival is
                  awake, and appears very distressed.

MALAHIDE steps back briskly and begins to peel his cloves off.
He nods at a nearby student.

                            MALAHIDE
                  My part in this is over.  You
                  may tidy up for me.  Kyle, you
                  come with me.

MALAHIDE and KYLE leave the room.


14    INT   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

KIRSTY has her hands over her face and is shaking.  RONSON stands
and crosses to her.  He takes her hand from her face and calms
her.

                            RONSON
                  Easy, easy.  Whatever happened,
                  whatever you saw, it's not here
                  now.

                            KIRSTY
                  I saw it...him.  But I got away.
                  And I took the box.  And I solved
                  it.  And they came.

                            RONSON
                  Who?

                            KIRSTY
                  The Cenobites.

She stares directly at RONSON, daring him to disbelieve.

                            KIRSTY
                  The Demons.

RONSON stares back, perhaps a glimmer of belief in his eyes.

On the soundtrack, the sudden and shocking sound of a door being
slammed open and hitting the wall.

KIRSTY screams. Even RONSON is startled.

In the doorway are DOCTOR MALAHIDE and KYLE.  MALAHIDE advances
into the room, smiling apologetically as he does so.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Sorry.  Must get that door
                  fixed.  Detective Ronson?

MALAHIDE holds his hand out, as RONSON nods in response.

                            MALAHIDE
                  I am Doctor Malahide.

The man shake hands. MALAHIDE gestures behind him.

                            MALAHIDE
                  My assistant, Kyle Macrae.  And
                  this must be Kirsty?

MALAHIDE speaks quickly, as if to get the formalities out of the
way.  As he says her name, he smiles benignly at KIRSTY who,
still distraught from her memories and shocked at the slamming of
the door, simply stares at him.

MALAHIDE turns his attention back to RONSON, drawing him away and
speaking to him in a lower voice.

Meanwhile, KYLE walks over to KIRSTY and smiles at her - long
enough to embarrass her into smiling back.

                            MALAHIDE
                  I've read the boy's statement.
                  Quite the adventure they
                  believe they had. I'd like to talk
                  to her alone. Do you think ... ?

RONSON looks over his shoulder at KIRSTY.  He then looks
carefully at MALAHIDE and then nods slowly.

                            RONSON
                  Mmmm.  O.K.  Frankly, I think
                  she's more your territory than
                  mine.  Shame.

RONSON looks back at KIRSTY.

                            RONSON
                  Kirsty.  Doctor Malahide's going
                  to look after you now.  Maybe we
                  could talk some more tomorrow.

KIRSTY nods vaguely and then, just as RONSON reaches the door,
calls out to him.

                            KIRSTY
                  Wait!  The mattress.  You've got
                  to destroy it.  She DIED on it,
                  you see.  The mattress.  It's
                  haunted now.  She can come back...
                  like Frank. SHE CAN COME BACK.

RONSON smiles helplessly at her, then glances at MALAHIDE with a
 "you see what I mean" expression, and leaves the room.

                            KIRSTY (to herself)
                  The mattress ...

MALAHIDE stares at her briefly, with a strange expression on his
face and then abruptly follows RONSON through the door.

KIRSTY is too absorbed to notice this odd behavior, but KYLE
stares incredulously as MALAHIDE leaves the room.

                            KYLE
                  Uh...excuse me a moment.

He follows to the door and stands in the doorway, looking down
the corridor.


15    INT   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR    NIGHT

RONSON stands before a set of double-doors, talking to a
UNIFORMED OFFICER.

MALAHIDE comes into view, walking swiftly, and instantly talks
over their conversation.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Detective. I'll be able to help
                  this girl. But I need your assistance ...


16    INT   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT

Looking back at the corridor, we see the door to KIRSTY'S room
ajar, and KYLE standing by it looking down.


17    INT   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT  (KYLE' P.O.V)

A LONG SHOT of MALAHIDE and RONSON.  KYLE, and we, are too far
away to hear what is said, but MALAHIDE in nodding and gesturing
emphatically, as if persuading RONSON of something.


18   INT   HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT

KYLE returns into the room and closes the door. His expression is
puzzled, troubled. Then he remembers there is a patient here and
he smiles.
                            KYLE
                  So...You're Kirsty, huh?


                            KIRSTY
                  You a doctor, too?

KYLE smiles again.

                            KYLE
                  Nearly a doctor. I'm Kyle
                  Macrae. Call me Kyle.

KIRSTY draws a deep breath, temporarily calmed. She even manages
a smile.

                            KIRSTY
                  Hi, Kyle.

MALAHIDE re-enters the room.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Now, Kirsty...

KIRSTY looks at him warily.

                            KIRSTY
                  The cop. He didn't believe me.

                            MALAHIDE
                  I suspect not. But that
                  doesn't necessarily mean
                  you're wrong, does it?

                            KIRSTY
                  Do you believe me?

MALAHIDE offers a re-assuring laugh.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Well, I don't know yet.
                  However, you're not lying.
                  YOU believe this is the truth.

                            KIRSTY
                  It IS the truth.

Suddenly, the door opens again. An INTERN is standing there. For
the briefest of moments, MALAHIDE looks furious and then,
catching himself, assumes his calm demeanor.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Well?

                            INTERN
                  Sorry, Dr. Malahide. But it's
                  Tiffany. She's escaped ... again.

MALAHIDE sighs.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Very Well.

He looks down at KIRSTY.

                            KIRSTY
                  I'm sorry, Kirsty. Kyle will
                  come back with something to
                  help you sleep. We shall speak
                  tomorrow.

MALAHIDE and KYLE follow the intern from the room, KYLE giving a
last friendly smile as the door closes behind them.


19   EXT.   CARNIVAL   NIGHT

We are staring down the midway of a deserted carnival. On either
side, stalls and rides beckon to pleasures that their locked
doors and tarpaulin-draped entrances deny. A light rain is
falling.

A huge wooden cut-out of a grinning clown dominates one stall
while the sign beneath him seems to state the ethos of the whole
place; LOTS 'O' FUN.

Another has a banner proclaiming FREAK SHOW, with the subheading
YOU'LL GASP AT THE GEEK!

On the horizon in the distance, almost denying the reality of
what we are seeing, tower vast cranes of unimaginable height
while beyond them impossibly huge oil-drums squat against the
moon-bright but cloudy sky.

Into shot, and running down the midway, comes a girl, TIFFANY.

TIFFANY is a girl in her early teens but looks younger
then her years due to her boyish figure and her slightly over-
delicate features.

For the last months, TIFFANY has been finding ways out of the
institute and making her way here, where she has one special
obsession, which we will soon see.

Following her into shot, but many yards behind, come two INTERNS
from the Institute. They contrast each other almost comically,
one being tall and plump while the other is smaller and thinner.
They're not quite the Stan and Ollie of the medical world but
with some serious rehearsal they could get there.

                            1st INTERN
                  Oh, Jesus -she's gonna make it.

Even as the first INTERN says this, we see TIFFANY make a sharp
left turn into a stall entrance.


20   EXT.   HALL OF MIRRORS   ENTRANCE   NIGHT

A front view of the stall into which TIFFANY has run. The large
sign above it proclaims 'HALL OF MIRRORS' and a smaller sign
perched above a distorting mirror to one side of the entrance
says 'YOU'LL BE AMAZED'.

The two INTERNS enter at a run.


21   INT.   HALL OF MIRRORS    NIGHT

There follows a hopelessly one-sided pursuit through the
mirror maze as TIFFANY effortlessly eludes the two INTERNS.

There are three major facets to this sequence;
1) Comic relief - as the two interns make fools of themselves.
There could even be a room of distorting mirrors where the thin
INTERN becomes fat and the fat one thin.
2) TIFFANY'S ease and expertise with patterns and puzzles.
3) Confusion of the audience's sense of the real and the unreal.

This goes on long enough for us to realise the 1ST INTERN was
right to worry, how long TIFFANY could elude them. Then,
jarringly, as the screen is full of reflected TIFFANYS
there suddenly appears amongst them a single image of
MALAHIDE.

Everything stops.

The image of MALAHIDE (and we shouldn't he sure yet if we're
looking at a reflection or the real man) puts its hands out,
palms up.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Tiffany. Come.

All the TIFFANYS move quietly toward him until they all disappear
from view. Then the real TIFFANY comes into shot, her back to us,
and walks toward what we now see to be the real MALAHIDE, who is
standing in a doorway deliberately framed like a mirror to
confuse the customers.

TIFFANY places her hands docilely on to MALAHIDE's outstretched
ones.


22   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

KIRSTY has been dozing fitfully, but is awakened by strange
noises. At first terrified, she slowly realises it is simply
someone being put in the room next door.

She waits until activity has ceased and then moves to her door.
It is unlocked. She moves out into the corridor.


23   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT

Looking warily from side to side, KIRSTY edges out into the
corridor, along it, and then stops by the door of the adjoining
room.


24   INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM   NIGHT   C.U.

A hand fits a piece of jig-saw puzzle into the space it belongs.
We know it is a jig-saw by the shape of the pieces, but it is
clearly not the conventional type - a picturesque photo - because
all we can see at this close-up angle are large areas of black
and white.


25    INT. TIFFANY'S ROOM   NIGHT

We now see that the puzzle is on the floor of a room of a similar
size to KIRSTY'S. It is slightly more decorated; It has curtains
and wallpaper. And a tiled floor. Sitting cross-legged on the
floor next to the puzzle is TIFFANY.

The puzzle, which we can now see more clearly, is an intricate
abstract design in black and white. There are several pieces
still un-fitted but TIFFANY is working steadily, efficiently, and
with complete concentration.

On a wall behind her there is a visual record of her progress
over the last few months. Sealed in plastic by staff members are.
Puzzles she has solved, with dates marking her advancement. They
begin with the simplest wood block animals usually given to very
small children. passing through photo-puzzles of increasing
difficulty, and culminating in one or two other examples of the
kind of complicated pattern-work she is involved in now.


26   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT

We pull out to see that this is KIRSTY'S P.O.V. from the glass
panel in the door of TIFFANY'S room.

TIFFANY looks up at one point and eye-contact is made. KIRSTY
gives a tentative smile and a small wave. TIFFANY stares at her.
The stare is long but unresponsive and finally TIFFANY returns to
the puzzle.

KIRSTY has her back to us and the camera is quite close in when a
hand suddenly moves into shot and touches her shoulder.

KIRSTY jumps back in alarm, fear on her face. But it is only
KYLE.

KYLE raises his hand in apology.

                            KYLE
                  Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. God, if
                  anyone should know not to do that,
                  it's me. I'm sorry. O.K.?

KIRSTY nods and gives a nervous smile. KYLE, still embarrassed by
his foolishness and eager to change the subject, nods towards the
glass panel.

                            KYLE
                  Sad, huh? She's been here
                  six months. Her name's TIFFANY.

                            KIRSTY
                  What's the matter with her?

                            KYLE
                  Almost complete withdrawal. She
                  hasn't said a word for nearly
                  two years.

                            KIRSTY
                  God, that's terrible.

                            KYLE
                  Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her
                  doing these jig-saws and things,
                  though. Says it's helping to
                  bring her out.

KYLE ushers KIRSTY back into her own room.


27   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   DAY

As he closes the door to KIRSTY's room, KYLE reaches into the
pocket of his lab-coat and produces a small box of pills.

                            KYLE
                  Anyway, let's concentrate on
                  you for a moment. Wanna suck
                  on this for me?

KIRSTY looks up at him sharply. He is proffering a pill and
grinning facetiously.

                            KIRSTY
                  Hey, good joke, Kyle. Do you
                  always come on to the mentally
                  ill?

KYLE's face falls. He blushes. Pressing the pills into KIRSTY's
hand, he backs off to the door, apologising.

                            KYLE
                  Shit. Sorry. Here's the
                  pills. Red face. Door. Bye.

He exits hurriedly, closing the door behind him. KIRSTY grins
despite herself. She looks at the pill for a second or two and
then puts it firmly back in the box. Realising there is no
bedside table, she puts the box on the wooden chair.

                            KIRSTY
                  Jesus, I'm glad I'm not paying
                  for this place.

She is about to lie down on the bed, when she senses something is
wrong in the room.

KIRSTY is instantly tense again. She swings her head to the side
and tenses in horror, stifling a scream.

In the corner of the room, against the wall lying in a pool of
blood, is her skinned father LARRY.

KIRSTY emits a pained moan of pure anguish as she realises what
she is looking at.

                            KIRSTY
                    (under her breath)
                  Daddy...

The thing in the corner raises its arm weakly from its side and
begins to write on the wall in its own blood.

It writes : I AM IN HELL; HELP ME.

KIRSTY covers her eyes with her hands and begins to sob.

KIRSTY takes her hands from her eyes.

The figure has gone. The pool of blood has disappeared. But, on
the wall the words remain.

KIRSTY makes herself rise from the bed and walk slowly across the
room.

Her eyes full of tears, she stretches out her arm and touches the
word 'I'.

As her fingers make contact, the words instantly disappear.

She presses her bloodied finger quickly to her lips before that
last trace of her father can vanish, too.


28    INT.    TIFFANY'S ROOM  NIGHT

TIFFANY is still sitting up cross-legged, weeping. Her puzzle is
completed.


29    EXT.    THE INSTITUTE   DAY

Basically an establishing shot to show it is the next morning but
it also serves to show MALAHIDE walking briskly to work. His suit
is tasteful and simple, but discreetly expensive-looking. He
walks with purpose and looks straight ahead, acknowledging only
with polite nods the respectful greetings of various JUNIOR
DOCTORS and NURSES he passes on his way. He enters the institute.

We should also see several patients being walked, or wheeled,
around by STAFF during this shot.

                            MALAHIDE
                          (off-camera)
                  And how are we feeling today...?


30   INT.   LARGE WARD   DAY

This is a large, traditional hospital ward with a line of beds
down each long wall and a wide central aisle.

Nearly all of the beds are occupied and, at the far end of the
ward, there is a male patient in a wheelchair.

All the PATIENTS' eyes turn immediately and happily to MALAHIDE
as he crosses the room, continuing his speech.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Better? Good.

He-doesn't stop his progress but walks straight through the room
and into the corridor.

As the door closes behind him the WHEELCHAIR PATIENT scowls.

                            W/CHAIR PATIENT
                  105 years and he still doesn't
                  know my name.


31    INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   DAY

MALAHIDE walks swiftly down the corridor in which we saw him talk
to RONSON earlier, but this time the camera follows him through
the double doors and further down the corridor.

He enters an elevator and the doors close in front of him.


32   INT.  BASEMENT CORRIDOR   DAY

MALAHIDE exits the elevator into a lower corridor, one not so
carefully decorated.

We are in the area in which the more deeply disturbed of the
Institute's patients live.

The rooms are smaller, closer together, and there is an
observation panel set in each door.

MALAHIDE looks into the first four rooms.

In the first, a middle-aged, overweight woman sits completely
motionless in the middle of the floor. She is dressed in a
shapeless white robe and is sitting crosslegged. Her head is
shaven, her eyes are rolled completely up into the sockets so
that only white shows.

In the second, a very thin man of about thirty is pressed as
tight as he can be into one corner of the room. His hair is long
and he has a full beard. He is naked but not unadorned - his body
and much of his cell wall is smeared in excrement.

In the third, a man of about MALAHIDE'S age-stands in the centre
of the room. He is of normal build but his head is shaved. His
face, scalp, and hands are covered in self-inflicted and
amaterurish tattoos- all of crosses. He is dressed in T-shirt and
jeans. With both hands he holds aloft a silver crucifix, pointing
it in all directions, as if under constant siege by Devils. He
mutters prayers and invocations constantly.

In the fourth, a man in his early twenties restrained in a
strait-jacket. He shuffles around on the call-floor, his eyes
twitching and flitting from one part of his body to another.

                            BROWNING
                          (muttering)
                  Get them off me. Get them off me.

Off-camera, we hear the sound of KIRSTY's sobbing - which bridges
the CUT TO:


33 INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM DAY

KYLE enters, having heard KIRSTY crying. She is sitting with her
legs over the side of the bed with her face in her hands.

KYLE immediately sits next to her and puts an arm around her
shoulder. He doesn't force her to speak. He lets her let the
tears out. Finally, she looks up.

                            KIRSTY
                  I...I had a visitor.

                            KYLE
                  What?

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's
                  ...it's. I don't know how to
                  help! I have to save him and I
                  don't know how to help!

                            KYLE
                         (Carefully)
                  Kirsty, I'm sorry...  don't
                  understand. I...

                            KIRSTY
                  I know. No-one can. But I have to save
                  him. Where's the other doctor? He said
                  He'd listen. He promised.

KYLE responds quickly to this. His faith in MALAHIDE is
strong, despite that curious incident of the previous night when
MALAHIDE followed RONSON out of the room.

                            KYLE
                  Dr. Malahide. Yes. Look, I'll
                  fetch him. You take it easy.
                  I'm sure he can help.

KYLE stands up, making soothing motions with his hands, and heads
for the door.

                            KIRSTY
                  Help. No, no-one can help. I
                  just want someone to listen
                  or I WILL go crazy.

                            KYLE
                  If anyone can help, HE can.

KIRSTY turns and gives KYLE a strange look as he opens the door.

                            KIRSTY
                  Yeah? He got a ticket to Hell?


34    INT.    HOSPITAL CORRIDOR     DAY

We TRACK with KYLE down the corridor, eventually reaching an
impressive door, which is slightly ajar. Even before we reach it,
we hear MALAHIDE's voice. He is clearly on the phone. Because of
the nature of what he is hearing, KYLE pauses when he reaches the
door, listening with a confused expression on his face.

                            MALAHIDE
                   (off-camera & gradually fading up)
                  Officer Kucich? Yes, Doctor
                  Malahide. You've spoken to
                  Ronson? Yes ... That's right.
                  The mattress ... No, I'll meet
                  you by the side entrance. No, no,
                  my HOUSE. Yes, let me make that
                  clear. The house, NOT the hospital.
                  ... Yes ... Fine, and thank you.

We hear the phone click. KYLE waits a moment and then walks
swiftly through the door, speaking as he does so.

                            KYLE
                  Doctor Malahide ... ?


35   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM    DAY

KIRSTY'S face fills the screen. Her voice is slightly dreamy, as
if she is still trying to understand herself the story she is
about to tell.

                            KIRSTY
                  It must have been going on
                  forever...

Her voice trails off. We pull out to see KIRSTY sitting up on her
bed. MALAHIDE on the wooden chair, and KYLE standing by the
door.

MALAHIDE's voice pulls her back.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Kirsty...?

KIRSTY snaps back and continues to speak in a more normal voice.

                            KIRSTY
                  But the part I know about,
                  That must have started with
                  my Uncle Frank...

                            MALAHIDE
                  Then let us speak of it ...

DISSOLVE TO


36   EXT.   MALAHIDE's HOUSE  TWILIGHT

We TRACK in slowly towards a modern house that we will learn is
MALAHIDE'S, up the drive, towards the front door.

DISSOLVE TO


37  INT.  MALAHIDE'S HALLWAY  TWILIGHT

The TRACK continues along the hallway and into the OBSESSION
ROOM.


38   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   NIGHT

The TRACK continues.

The room is dim, lit only by stray shafts of moonlight.

On the floor in the centre of the room is the mattress.

The TRACK stops. A main light is clicked on and MALAHIDE moves
into shot.  MALAHIDE pours himself a scotch from the decanter that
sits on the writing table and approaches the mattress.

He is clearly very, excited. He walks around the mattress two or
three times, never taking his eyes off it.

He walks back to the writing table, throws his drink back, puts
the glass down and leaves the room.


39   EXT.   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

MALAHIDE leaves through his front door and walks toward the
hospital.


40    INT.   OBSESSION ROOM NIGHT

After a few seconds silence we hear a repeated clicking sound, as
if something is being forced, followed by a louder snap and the
sound of a sash window being opened.

The curtains balloon inwards, part, and KYLE steps into the room.

He stands still for a moment, as if making sure he is alone, and
then begins to take in his surroundings.

The room is entirely devoted to MALAHIDE'S secret obsession -
with the Paranormal in general and the Lament Configuration in
particular.

It is a fair-sized, square shaped room. Prints, paintings, and
photographs cover the walls. All of these pictures relate in some
way to his obsession; photographs of ghost-sightings; portraits
of magicians from Cagliostro to Crowley; prints of arcane symbols
and pentagrams, etc.

Specifically, we recognize a print that resembles very closely
the jigsaw he has had TIFFANY recently solve. Also, there are
framed diagrams (which look very old) of the Lament Configuration
-Both open and closed.

On a long, low table there are three glass cases. In each of
these cases is a Lament Configuration. On each case is a small
label giving a location, a date of acquisition, and a number -
which we may assume to be the number of deaths attributable to
that specific box.

These labels read:          CAIRO 3/4/'59 7
                            LYONS 6/2/'72 4
                            NEW YORK 12/3/'81 5

There are also, on a small desk-top bookshelf on a writing table,
editions of MALAHIDE'S own books. He seems to have spent his
career publicly denying what he is privately obsessed with -
because the books titles include 'Possession: Not Demons but
Disease','The Myth of the Diabolic', and 'The Internal Inferno'.

                            KYLE
                  Jesus Christ. Jee-sus-kerr-ist!

We assume he has visited MALAHIDE'S house before, but he has
clearly never seen this room.

He stares at the mattress with incredulity, as if he still can't
believe his superior has had it brought here. Then he begins to
look around the room in more detail. He approaches the glass
cases and bends slightly to look at their contents.

KYLE shakes his head.

                            KYLE
                  Oh, shit.


41   INT.   BASEMENT CORRIDOR NIGHT

MALAHIDE walks past a bank of meters and huge circuit breakers on
his way to the lower and of the corridor, by the cells
of the very disturbed. He stops by the cell of the man in the
strait-jacket. We hear from the outside the familiar muttering of
BROWNING. MALAHIDE enters the call.


42   INT.   BROWNING'S CELL   NIGHT

As MALAHIDE enters, BROWNING looks at him. His eyes demand, not
plead, and he speaks through clenched teeth.

                            BROWNING
                  Get them off me. Get. Them.
                  Off. Me.


43   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   NIGHT

KYLE is rooting through the drawers in the writing table.

Generally the contents are unremarkable - handwritten notes, a
few patients case-files etc. - but in one of the drawers he
finds a black ring-binder which he takes out and lays on the
table.

It is a book of faces. There are about fifteen sheets in the
binder. Some of them are genuine photographic prints, some
photocopies of original photos. They range widely in age, race,
and sex. They are all full-face portraits. Chronologically, the
range is extensive too. Some pictures (generally photocopies)
appear to date from the earliest days of photography, the late
1880's, others have an Edwardian appearance, or suggest the
1920's. Only one or two seem to be less than thirty years old.

KYLE flicks back and forward in the book, wondering on the
significance of these people.

He is lost in the musings when the click of the front door tells
him MALAHIDE has returned.

KYLE closes the book and quickly slips it back into the drawer.
He heads rapidly for the window he came in through but realises
MALAHIDE is too close for him to open it and make good his
escape. Instead he stands between the window and the curtains,
pulling the latter closed over him.

MALAHIDE enters the room, leading BROWNING who is still strait-
jacketed.


44    INT.    BEHIND THE CURTAIN        NIGHT

We see KYLE standing very still in the limited space behind the
curtains. It is clearly seen that, given the thoroughness with
which he closed the curtains and his immobile position, he is
unable to see what is happening in the room. He can hear, but not
see.


45   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM    NIGHT

MALAHIDE leads BROWNING across to the mattress. Standing beside
it, he unbuckles and removes the strait-jacket from his patient.

BROWNING, beneath the strait-jacket, is naked to the waist. His
arms and cheat are a mass of scars of various age and size.

MALAHIDE gestures to the mattress. Now that his arms are free,
BROWNING is scratching furiously.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Mr. Browning. Please, lie down.

BROWNING lies down, still scratching, trust and hope in his eyes.


46  INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   BROWNING'S DELUSION  (BROWNING'S P.O.V.)

As if looking through BROWNING's eyes, we see his body stretched
out before us on the mattress.

The naked chest and arms are covered with raised lumps, red and
painful-looking.

As his scratching arms attack these lumps, they break open,
revealing vile black insects that have hatched beneath his skin.
BROWNING brushes these away while he scratches at the remaining
lumps.


47   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   NIGHT

BROWNING has already re-opened some of the more recent scars, and
blood slowly rises to the surface of his skin.

MALAHIDE walks over to his writing tableland goes into one of
the drawers.

He produces an old-fashioned cut-throat razor and walks back to
BROWNING

                            MALAHIDE
                  Here. This will help.

He proffers the razor. BROWNING siezes it. MALAHIDE steps back
quickly, a mixture of anticipation and apprehension on his face.

BROWNING slashes at his body and left arm with a short, sharp,
slicing motions. In his mind, he is lancing the cysts that
contain the tormenting insects. In reality, he is inflicting
horrifying damage on himself.

Blood pours from the multitude of wounds, running over his body
and down onto the mattress.

Suddenly, without any preliminaries, two painfully thin, flayed,
mucus-covered arms shoot out of the mattress, one on either side
of the still-busy BROWNING.

They wrap themselves tightly across his chest and crush him
tightly to the mattress, as a head, similarly wasted, oozes out
of the mattress to the side of BROWNING's head.

Beneath his delusions, BROWNING suddenly has an inkling of what is
happening to him. His eyes widen and his mouth opens ready to
emit a scream but the monster beneath him forces a hand over his
mouth as it buries its face into the soft flesh of his neck.

Two legs now rise from the oozing slime that the bloodstains on
the mattress have become. They too wrap themselves around
BROWNING so that he is held tight.

Finally, with titanic effort, he gathers enough momentum to roll
completely free of the mattress and falls to the floor beside it.
The thing on his back now is pulling free from the bed of
bubbling, frothing slime that the mattress now is with a sliding,
slurping sound.

The monster's face is now deep in the flesh of his throat, and
even as BROWNING forces himself up first onto one knee and then,
very unsteadily, onto his feet, we can see him wasting away - his
face losing its fullness and colour, his chest sinking in on
itself.

The creature, which is still wrapped around him and clinging
tight is, unlike him, growing in stature by the second. Muscles
are inflating, arteries pumping more vigorously, and flesh itself
filling out.

Its horrific thin-ness when it first appeared effectively unsexed
it but now, as its regeneration continues, the fullness of its
hips, the roundness of its thighs, and the sacs of fat and muscle
that bloom above its ribs confirm its female nature. If there was
any doubt that this was JULIA, it is now disappearing.

BROWNING is now nearly a walking corpse and it is the strength of
his will alone that allows him to take a few faltering steps with
JULIA still enveloping him. With the desperate strength with which
she clings to him and the way her legs are wrapped around his
hips, it is like an obscenely perverse parody of sexual passion.

MALAHIDE has been watching all this with an incredible mix of
emotions playing across his face. Still human enough to feel both
fear and disgust at what is happening he is nevertheless awe
struck and exhilarated. He has waited all his life for such an
irrefutable demonstration of the power and the truth of the
supernatural.

Similarly, the scientist in him is fascinated by the living
anatomy lessons that JULIA's regeneration and BROWNING rapid
decay offer.

With one last dying effort, the now-almost-husk-like BROWNING
breaks JULIA'S grip and makes a futile step forward as she falls
from him. He totters towards the curtains.

Just as the audience think he will pull them down with him,
revealing KYLE, JULIA grabs his ankle and pulls. He falls back to
the floor.


48   INT.   BEHIND THE CURTAINS   NIGHT

The loud noise of BROWNING's fall renews KYLE's resolve to see
what is going on. Carefully, he shifts his position so that he
can see through a small gap in the curtains.


49   INT.   KYLE'S P.O.V.   NIGHT

KYLE may have heard one or two strange and unpleasant noises but
BROWNING has not screamed nor JULIA spoken; nothing has prepared
him for what he sees - a skinned woman sucking out what life
remains from the dried husk of a psychotic man.


50   INT.   BEHIND THE CURTAINS   NIGHT

KYLE's head jerks back, shaking as if he's just had an electric
shock. His mouth moves but no sound emerges.

                            KYLE
                           (mimed)
                  Jesus Christ!

His terror simultaneously urging speed and silence, KYLE gingerly
maneuvers himself out of the window.


51   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   NIGHT

JULIA lies back satisfied on the floor. She looks up weakly at
MALAHIDE.

                            JULIA
                  Help me.

Her voice is perfect. MALAHIDE stares at her, his fascination
intense. He crosses the few yards that separate them. He looks at
her, lying beside the hollow shell that was CHEYNEY. Her eyes
stare back, brilliant, sparkling, alive.

                            JULIA
                  Help Me.

MALAHIDE realises her temporary vulnerability; all the life force
she has absorbed from BROWNING has made up her body, but it will
take some moments for the strength to return to her.

Fascinated and sympathetic as he is however he cannot yet quite
brine himself to touch this creature. Instead he moves the
mattress nearer to her, allowing her to crawl back onto it and
lie down again.

MALAHIDE stares down at her. He attempts a smile, but is too
nervous to make it convincing. He is trembling slightly. This
contact with the beyond is something he has dreamt of for years,
but nevertheless the physical reality is overwhelming.

JULIA treats him to the approximation of a smile. She is far from
nervous.

She studies herself. Her figure is fully formed, her womanliness
undeniable. All she is missing is a skin. She stretches her arms.
She lifts her legs. She writhes on the bed in pleasure, like an X-
ray photograph of a calendar girl.

MALAHIDE stares at her, following the sensual movements of her
body. He swallows, a little embarrassed by his response to the
naked display he is privileged to watch.

JULIA'S eyes twinkle at him.

                            JULIA
                  Don't be embarrassed. You're
                  my friend.

She looks away and continues her stretching and wiggling, more
conscious of it now as an erotic display.

The strength has flooded through her body as she rises to her
feet, and stops off the mattress, smiling at MALAHIDE.

MALAHIDE backs away from her as she moves towards him, doing his
best to return her smile.

After a few steps, JULIA stops and simply stares into MALAHIDE'S
eyes. He too stops and returns the gaze. The camera circles them
slowly several times, studying them - the dressed, nervous man
and skinned, confident woman.

                            JULIA
                  Well?

MALAHIDE says nothing. Perhaps he swallows nervously. The camera
continues its circling movements. The scene FADES TO BLACK and
JULIA begins to laugh, small, sensual giggles at first building
finally as the blackness comes into an almost hysterical
crescendo of raucous joy.


52   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

KIRSTY is again lying on her back on top of the bed. She is a
stark contrast to JULIA. No display. No laughter.

Her eyes are open and red-rimmed from weeping now. There is also
complete silence.

All the more jarring, then, the sudden sound of someone fumbling
at the handle of KIRSTY'S door.

Her eyes widen in alarm and she flings herself off the bed,
scanning the room for anything that can be used as a weapon.
There is nothing but the chair and she she has all but lifted it
aloft when she sees that it is KYLE, who comes into the room.

                            KIRSTY
                  Shit, Kyle. This is getting to
                  be a habit. What is it, some
                  kind of shock-therapy?

She was angry, relieved, and amused when she realized it was KYLE
and all these showed in her voice and face. Now they drop away
completely, replaced by a nervous apprehension as she becomes
aware of the blank horror on his face.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, Jesus. What is it?

KYLE opens his mouth a few times, as if unsure what to say.

                            KYLE
                  It's all true.


53   INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM   NIGHT

TIFFANY walks around her room, staring at her completed puzzles -
those on the wall and the one on the floor - and waiting for the
next one.

FADE OUT

FADE IN


54   EXT.   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

A simple shot tells us it is the next morning.


55   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

MALAHIDE , dressed in a black suit, is in the room, staring at
the empty mattress. We TRACK with him through to his LIVING ROOM.


56   INT.   LIVING ROOM  MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

In contrast to the secret and private obsession room, this room
is the tasteful and upmarket room of the successful professional.

It is a long spacious room with modern furniture and white walls.
The walls are mostly free of decoration save for two or three
large canvases of abstract art.

The longest wall is broken up only by a low circular table, which
rests against it about half way down. On this table is a very
simple black vase containing a spray of beautiful white lilies.
Above this vase on the wall is a large frameless mirror.

As MALAHIDE enters, the first thing he sees is a bloody palm-
print on one of his white walls. He blinks at it and looks down
into the room. We CUT TO;

JULIA. At first it seems she is staring at the lilies, but as we
TRACK around her, we realise she is staring at the reflection of
her skinned self.

Her face snarls at herself, she roars with rage, forms her hand
into a fist and shatters the mirror.

MALAHIDE rushes towards her. She swings round and freezes him
with a glance.

They hold their positions for a moment, MALAHIDE nervous and
JULIA furious, and then JULIA makes herself relax. She sighs,
takes a few deep breaths, and then speaks.

                            JULIA
                  I'm cold.

TIME CUT


57   INT.   LIVING ROOM   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

CLOSE UP on a strangely Art Deco electric fan heater, with bright
red coils emitting waves of heat.

We pull out to see MALAHIDE standing by the table with the flowers.
There is now a half-full glass of wine on the table, along with
an ashtray where a cigarette burns away ignored. A pack of
cigarettes is now visible in the breast pocket of MALAHIDE's jacket.

JULIA enters the room and closes the door behind her. She is
dressed in one of MALAHIDE'S suits. It is a light weight suit of
white linen, a suit for expensive holidays in hot countries.

She crosses the room to the table; pausing slightly in the centre
of the room, to allow MALAHIDE to look at her.

                            JULIA
                  Well?

MALAHIDE'S nervousness has retreated a little, he manages to
smile. He nods his head slowly a few times.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Yes... Yes. You look...

                            JULIA
                  Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?

                            MALAHIDE
                  No. You look...

He pauses, lost for words.

JULIA doesn't wait for an answer. She crosses to the table and
takes up his glass of wine. She downs it in one.

MALAHIDE stares at her, a little surprised.

                            JULIA
                  Yes, I still like WINE ...

She smiles strangely at him and then moves closer. Slowly,
keeping her eyes on his, she reaches into his breast pocket
for his packet of cigarettes and places one in her mouth.

                            JULIA
                  ... and more.

For a moment, MALAHIDE's face is stone. Then, slowly, he returns
her smile and, drawing his lighter, lights her cigarette.


58   INT.   SHOPPING MALL   DAY

A large multi-level shopping complex obviously up-market and
expensive.

We see MALAHIDE, riding up one on the central escalators, looking
around him as he does so, as if searching for a specific shop.

He reaches the next level and begins to walk along one of the
several avenues that lead away from the central square containing
the escalators.

He walks past several shops, looking in their windows; a chic
specialty shop, a window full of clocks, a cutler's. Finally,
he stops in front of one. He stares at its display window.

The window is classily minimal. There is in fact only one dress
in it. It is an exquisite white cocktail gown. The gown is full
length but quite tight-fitting, merely flaring a little from
below the knee, and has a halter-neck.

MALAHIDE walks into the shop.


59   INT.   MALAHIDE'S BEDROOM   DAY

We are looking at a reflection of MALAHIDE in the large mirror
that covers the inside of his wardrobe door. His real hand and
his reflected hand come together at the edge of the door and tip
it slightly, changing the image that the mirror shows us.

Now we see JULIA. She is in the dress from the shop in the mall.
It is a perfect fit and shows her figure off very well. Being a
halter-neck, however, her skinned arms and shoulders are
completely bare. Also, it is quite low cut at the front, exposing
a fair degree of visceral cleavage, and at the back.

JULIA turns fully around in front of the mirror examining herself
from every angle. Her mood is unreadable until she speaks.

                            JULIA
                  Close it.

MALAHIDE does so. He understands and tries to console her..

                            MALAHIDE
                  It's a beautiful dress...

                            JULIA
                  I know.

TIME CUT


59   INT.   LIVING ROOM   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

CLOSE UP MALAHIDE'S hands applying wide, white, surgical
bandages to JULIA.

We pull out as MALAHIDE steps away from JULIA. They are both
standing in the middle of the living room floor.

JULIA'S arms, torso, and head are now completely enclosed in
neatly and professionally applied bandages. There are three slits
for her eyes and mouth but apart from these she is completely
covered. Over these she is still wearing the white dress.

                            MALAHIDE
                  There...

JULIA lifts her arms slightly to look at them and then touches her
bandaged face. She turns towards MALAHIDE. The camera begins the
same circling movement it made around them the previous night.

MALAHIDE'S nervousness has practically disappeared. He has helped
this woman. He has bandaged her and dressed her. He is slightly
in awe of her, but it is now tinged with excitement, not fear.

The camera's circling grows faster.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Well?

JULIA walks towards him, slowly raising her hands. When she is
close enough her hands cup his cheeks. She pulls him towards her,
and, tipping her head to one side, kisses him. Her body moulds
itself to his.

She leans her head back. Were they have kissed blood has pressed
up onto the bandage from her skinned flesh. It looks like smeared
lipstick.

                            JULIA
                  Well?

MALAHIDE puts his arms around her waist. They kiss tenderly.
Slowly, almost nervously, he lowers his hands until they rest on
her buttocks and presses her in towards him. They begin to spin
themselves now, echoing the camera movements.

They cross the room, kissing blindly, until they come to rest
against the wall that bears JULIA's bloody palm print. JULIA
twists their bodies so that MALAHIDE is pressed against the wall,
and begins to move her hips forcefully and sensually against
MALAHIDE.

The camera is stationary now, watching without movement as
MALAHIDE begins to raise JULIA's dress up her legs, her hand
on his wrist, helping and encouraging.

About halfway up the thigh, the bandaging disappears and the
raw flesh is exposed.

The kissing and the fumbling continue until they are making
fast and violent love against the wall.

His hands clutch tightly at her hips and he pulls his face away
from the kissing to loan it on her shoulder so that we see his
face as it grimaces in ecstasy.

He cries out and shudders and slowly both their movements stop.

He strokes at her back gently and their bodies relax.

                            JULIA
                     (almost coyly)
                  Now all we need is a skin.


60   INT.   BATHROOM KYLE'S APARTMENT   DAY

CLOSE UP on shower jets hitting KIRSTY's face and naked
shoulders.

Her eyes are closed, but she smiles in pleasure as the water
refreshes her.

A knocking is heard. KIRSTY moves her head out of the water's
path and shouts.

                            KIRSTY
                  Yeah?


61   INT.   KYLE'S APARTMENT   DAY

It is basically a studio apartment - everything except the bathroom
facilities is in the one room. There is a sofa - with sheets and
blankets on it - a bed, a dining/all-purpose table with two
chairs, shelves full of records and books, and a small working
desk against one of the walls. The desk is weighed down by text
books and notes and, tacked to the wall above it, are medical prints,
some of the brain and central nervous system, but also two fullcoloured
anatomical prints - one of a man and one of a woman. They could
almost be portraits of JULIA and FRANK.

KYLE, fully dressed, is standing by the bathroom door, his hand
still in a knocking position.

                            KYLE
                  You O.K.?

Silence.

                            KYLE
                  Kirsty? You 0. K.?

The bathroom door opens and KIRSTY Comes into the main room,
dressed in a toweling robe that is clearly a 'hers' not a 'his'.

She crosses the room to a mirror, rubbing at her wet hair with a
towel.

                            KIRSTY
                  No bad dreams.

                            KYLE
                  So you slept O.K.?

KIRSTY gestures at the sofa.

                            KIRSTY
                  As much as that bed of
                  nails allowed.

KYLE glances meaningfully at the bed as he replies.

                            KYLE
                  Well, the sofa isn't often used
                  for sleeping on...

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh yeah? On your own a lot,
                  Huh?

KYLE grins.

                            KYLE
                  Like the robe?

KIRSTY returns the smile via the mirror.

KYLE crosses the room to sit at his dining table. Empty coffee
cups, the remnants of a loaf and some cheese suggests their
breakfast was simple and finished some time ago.

KIRSTY gathers her clothes from by the sofa and moves back into
the bathroom to dress.

KYLE waits a few moments and then speaks.

                            KYLE
                  I think I need to talk. About
                  what I saw.

KIRSTY emerges, fully dressed, her hair still damp.

                            KIRSTY
                  You thought I was crazy, didn't
                  you?

KYLE spreads his hands wide.

                            KYLE
                  Jesus, yes! What do you expect.
                  I mean, God, I still do! It's
                  just that now I'm crazy too.

He grins wryly. KIRSTY moves to the sofa and sits down.

                            KIRSTY
                  And you're sure it was a woman?

                            KYLE
                  God, I wish I could say no.
                  This is going to do terrible
                  things to my attitude, you know.

KIRSTY grins at him.

                            KIRSTY
                  Don't worry about it. Your
                  attitude sucks anyway.

                            KYLE
                  Hey, so for it. Don't let pity
                  stop you. I'm down. Nail me.

For a moment, they laugh together but then stop.  KIRSTY stares
downward and then suddenly bursts into tears.

                            KIRSTY
                  What can I do? How can I
                  save him?

KYLE joins her on the sofa. He offers an arm but she shakes it
off.

                            KIRSTY
                  The box. I need the box.

                            KYLE
                  The box? Like in your story?
                  Like in his house?

KIRSTY's tears suddenly stop. She looks at KYLE.

                            KIRSTY
                           (sharply)
                  What?

                            KYLE
                  The Boxes. In the House. I
                  told you.

                            KIRSTY
                  What do you mean?

                            KYLE
                  The boxes! I TOLD you.

                            KIRSTY
                  You DIDN'T tell me. Do you
                  mean Malahide's got...

                            KYLE
                  Yeah. The things you were
                  talking about.

KIRSTY heads instantly for KYLE'S door.

                            KIRSTY
                  I'm going.

KYLE runs across the room and puts a restraining hand on his
door.

                            KYLE
                  Wait a minute. What do you mean,
                  'I'm going?' TO the HOUSE?

KIRSTY nods and pulls at the door handle.

                            KIRSTY
                  Get out of the way.

                            KYLE
                  Are you crazy?

                            KIRSTY
                  I don't know, Kyle. You're the
                  fucking expert. Now get out of
                  the way!

                            KYLE
                  WHY?

                            KIRSTY
                          (shouting)
                  Because I'm going to get my father!

Tears start to her eyes and she stares at KYLE defiantly. Then
she repeats, more softly;

                            KIRSTY
                  I'm going to get my father.

There is a two-second silence between them as they stare at each
other.

Finally, Kyle backs away from the door, raising a finger.

                            KYLE
                  Two seconds. Just two seconds.
                  Don't move.

He rushes across the room, grabs a jacket, and moves back to the
door.

                            KYLE
                  O.K. Let's go.

                            KIRSTY
                  Kyle, you don't have...

                            KYLE
                  I KNOW I don't have to. It's
                  just my time of the month to be a
                  complete fucking idiot. O.K.?

KIRSTY stares at him, her face at first blank then suffused with
emotion. She leans across and plants a chaste kiss on his lips
then pulls back. There is a beat while they simply stare at each
other and suddenly they are tight in each other's arms, kissing
fervently. But the kiss is fuelled, not by passion, but by fear
and their mutual need for human solace in the face of the
unknown.

As the kiss continues, the camera pulls back from them.


62   INT.   THE BLOOD-BOUDOIR   DAY

CLOSE UP as JULIA (still bandaged) and MALAHIDE come together for
a kiss. They part and, as JULIA moves across the room, the camera
begins a long TRACK around the room.

First, it reaches a naked GIRL. As catatonic as TIFFANY, she says
nothing but her eyes betray her terror. Her hands are tied above
her.

JULIA moves in towards the girl, her eyes glittering with an alien
hunger beneath their gauze mask. As she nears the girl, the TRACK
passes them and moves through the room.

MALAHIDE has done his mistress proud. It had been an empty
upstairs room (no furniture, bare floorboards) but now it
resembles a nightmarish cross between a butcher's shop and a
bordello.

The camera slowly reveals, as it TRACKS, that there are seven
more people in the room. Seven dead people. Dried-out husks.

The TRACKING is now completing its circle around the room. After
the corpses, we return to JULIA and the GIRL - but the GIRL too
is now a hollow, dried-out shell.

JULIA moves back into the centre of the room and stands still.

MALAHIDE crosses the room to her quickly, drawing a wicked-
looking kitchen knife from his pocket as he does so. He reaches
JULIA and raises the knife to her face.

With one swift, precise movement, he slices the bandages across
the side of her face. JULIA raises her hand and pulls the mask
away.

The camera sweeps in toward her as she does this until her face
is in CLOSE UP as the bandage-mask is pulled aside.

Her face is perfect.


63   EXT.   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

MALAHIDE emerges from his front door. He is still in his black
suit and looks every inch the respectable professional. He looks
neither left nor right but moves straight off, a busy man with
things to do.

A few seconds after he has gone off-camera, KYLE and KIRSTY
emerge from around the corner of the house.

KYLE gestures to KIRSTY to follow him and leads her around to the
window he broke in through on the previous night.


64   INT. OBSESSION ROOM   DAY

The room is much as we saw it last.

The window slides up and KYLE pulls himself into the room. He
looks around it carefully. Sure that the monster he saw the
previous night is no longer in the room, he helps KIRSTY in
through the window.

KIRSTY's eyes go at once to the three LAMENT CONFIGURATIONS in
the glass cases. She crosses the room eagerly.

KYLE rushes after her and stops her opening one of the cases.

                            KYLE
                  Wait! The .. thing ...
                  I want to be sure it's
                  not here.

KIRSTY nods and KYLE leaves the room.


65   INT.   STAIRS/LANDING MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

KYLE advances carefully, and slowly, from the stairs onto the
landing. He looks about him at every step he takes.

Ahead of him on the landing is a door, which is very slightly
ajar.

He advances gingerly down the landing to the door.

When he reaches it, he pauses. We see his face working as he
ponders his choices -should he push it open inch by slow inch, or
slam it inwards quickly?

Very slowly he moves his hand towards the door. The camera
matches his movement, moving in on his hand, the door, and the
space between.

His fingertips are less than an inch from touching the door when
another hand shoots into view and grabs his wrist.

JULIA has crept up beside him on the landing while all his
attention was on the door.

KYLE swings round in horror, his mouth opening to scream when he
sees that JULIA has her other hand to her mouth, her finger at
her lips in a silencing gesture.

There is of course, nothing for him to recognize from the
monstrous vision of the previous night. JULIA's arms, chest, and
face are completely re-skinned now. All KYLE sees is a beautiful
stranger in a white dress.

                            JULIA
                  Sssh. I think it's still here.

                            KYLE
                  What? The...The thing?

JULIA nods.

                            JULIA
                  Yes. I had to stop you going in
                  there because I knew you'd cry
                  out. Any normal person would.
                  It ...It's just TERRIBLE.

                            KYLE
                  Is it in there?

                            JULIA
                  No. Not now.

KYLE swallows, nods, and gently, pushes the door open. He walks
into the room.


66   INT.   THE BLOOD-BOUDOIR   DAY

The camera follows KYLE into the room. He reaches the middle
before horror and disgust stop him.

He hears a click behind him and turns to see JULIA has come into
the room and closes the door behind her. She looks at KYLE.

                            JULIA
                  Was I right? Is it terrible?

KYLE stares all around him. All eight victims have been sucked
dry. He is surrounded by dead husks.

His face is ghastly. He looks like he is about to faint. He nods.
His voice is a cracked whisper.

                            KYLE
                  Yes. Yes, it's terrible.

JULIA crosses the room rapidly towards him. Her face is a
picture of concern.

                            JULIA
                  Oh. You look awful.  You poor
                  boy. Come here...

As she speaks, JULIA's arms are opening out to him. KYLE sees the
comfort offered and advances towards her, too.

As they come together, the camera moves around them and we see,
for the first time, that JULIA is still incomplete; Her entire
back is still glistening raw flesh, the naked bones of the spine
still clearly visible.

Their arms go around each other just as JULIA completes her
speech;

                            JULIA
                  ...Come to Mother ...

As KYLE's hands touch the sticky, mucoid meat of her shoulders,
it is instantly clear to him what has happened. For a moment he
freezes in terror.

His arms fly from her and he throws his head back. But JULIA is
very strong now and her grip does not relax.

Kyle's expression is a mixture of terror and confusion as he
stares into the beautiful face of the monster.

JULIA smiles at him, a hungry, aroused smile.

                            JULIA
                  What's your name?

KYLE can hardly speak for fear.

                            KYLE
                  Kyle...

                            JULIA
                  I'm JULIA.

She raised one hand from his back to the back of his head and
presses his face to hers.

JULIA plays it exactly as a sensual, passionate kiss, her mouth
wide open, her head moving rhythmically and sinuously.

KYLE's reaction is somewhat different; his arms flail in panic
(though only from the elbow - JULIA'S grip prevents anything
more) and his head makes jerking, backward movements against her
pressing hand.

The camera moves around the embracing couple until it is behind
JULIA.

The back of her gown, as we know, is extremely low. As the kiss
continues, we see skin creeping above the line of the gown at the
base of her spine and gradually flowing up her back until finally
it meets and blends perfectly with ragged and raw edges of the
skin at her neck and shoulders. JULIA is complete again.

While this process has been going on, KYLE has been dying slowly
and horribly in her arms, his lifeforce being sucked into her
through their open mouths. His body, by the time her back is
completely formed, is shrunken, hollow, and dried up.

JULIA takes her arms from around the corpse of KYLE and steps
back, allowing the husk to fall to the floor.

JULIA licks her lips and looks down, not without affection, at
the dead KYLE. She smiles.

                            JULIA
                  Thank you, Kyle.


67   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   DAY

KIRSTY has found the black ring-binder and laid it on the
writing table.

She has separated one of the photographs from the others and laid
it out on the table beside the binder. It is the ENGLISH OFFICER
from the opening sequence. KIRSTY has obviously recognized something
familiar in it but she can't quite grasp it completely.

She is still puzzling over it when she suddenly realises that
several minutes have elapsed since KYLE left her there. Her
head straightens up and her puzzled look is replaced by a
slightly worried one.

                            KIRSTY
                          (to herself)
                  Kyle...?

She folds up the photograph and puts it in her pocket.

She crosses to the door and opens it. She does not go through it
immediately but stands in the doorway for a moment, her hand
still on the door, cocking her head slightly as if listening.

                            KIRSTY
                        (slightly louder)
                  Kyle?

She can't hear anything, but she regards that as a bad sign, not
a good one. She leaves the room.


68   INT.   STAIRS/LANDING   DAY

KIRSTY makes her way up the stairs. Unlike KYLE a little earlier
she moves up them quite quickly and advances onto the landing.

When she is on the landing and looking at the closed door to
JULIA's Boudoir she stops, standing still and staring at the
door.

KIRSTY suppresses a shudder. She bites her lip, takes two or
three deep breaths, crosses to the door firmly, and flings it
open, moving into the room even as she does so.


69   INT.  THE BLOOD-BOUDOIR   DAY

KIRSTY moves three or four steps into the room and then stops
dead. The door swings shut behind her.

KIRSTY's eyes flick left and right, taking in the sickening
details of the room's contents, and then stare straight ahead,
focusing on the figure in white which is turning around to face
her.

JULIA completes her turn and looks at KIRSTY completely
impassively for a moment. Then her mouth opens up into a smile of
welcome - but there is nothing but hate in her eyes.

                            JULIA
                  Kirsty! How nice of
                  you to drop in.

JULIA glances meaningfully at the dead thing that lies beside her
feet and then back at KIRSTY.

                            JULIA
                  You have surprisingly good taste in men.

KIRSTY's fear and disgust are momentarily displaced by a furious
rage as she realises what JULIA has done. Her face erupts into
anger and she screams out.

                            KIRSTY
                  Kyle! No! I'll kill you,
                  you...

She flings herself across the room at JULIA even as she speaks.

JULIA is completely unphased by this attack and simply raises one
arm. She siezes the wrist of the arm that KIRSTY has raised into
a clenched fist and effortlessly throws KIRSTY bodily back across
the room. We realise for the first time the immense physical
strength that JULIA now possesses.

KIRSTY smashes into the door and falls to a sitting position
against it. She is shaken and slightly hurt enough not to get to
her feet immediately but she stares at JULIA with undimmed
hatred.

JULIA throws a look halfway between a smile and a sneer.

                            JULIA
                  Oh, you can try it, you
                  little bitch. I'd love you
                  to try it. But I'm not just
                  the woman I was.

                            KIRSTY
                  What, you mean you're something
                  more than a whore with a vicious
                  streak?

                            JULIA
                  I mean I'm something more than
                  human, you little shit!

JULIA snaps this first line but then holds her anger in check.
She shakes her head and an amused smile plays across her lips.

                            JULIA
                  Oh, Kirsty. They didn't tell
                  you, did they? I'm afraid
                  they've changed the rules of
                  the fairy tale; I'm no longer
                  just the wicked step-mother.

The smile disappears and she delivers the next line with an
utterly straight face. It is, after all, the truth.

                            JULIA
                  Now I'm the Evil Queen.

The hatred and the heat returns to her voice.

                            JULIA
                  So come on; Take your best
                  shot, Snow White.

KIRSTY scrambles to her feet and again charges at JULIA.

JULIA steps forward to meet her advance and delivers a single
back-handed swipe across KIRSTY's face with such force that not
only is the girl knocked off her feet but is actually knocked
unconscious.

KIRSTY rolls onto her back and lies at JULIA's feet.

JULIA stares down at the unconscious body. When it was awake, it
was KIRSTY and her attitude to it was based on personal enmity.
Now, it is simply another body and she judges it differently; it
is firm, full, healthy, and young. We see the expression on her
face change from hatred and triumph to pure appetite. She licks
her lips and her eyes glisten. She begins to bend slightly
towards it.

                            MALAHIDE
                         (off-camera)
                  Julia!

The door to the room opens. JULIA straightens up and looks as
MALAHIDE stands in the doorway. Her eyebrows question this
interruption.

A second later, and it is explained. He leads TIFFANY into the
room.

                                               TIME CUT


70   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   DAY

TIFFANY sits cross-legged in the middle of the floor. She appears
to be alone in the room. Cradled in her lap is a Lament
Configuration, taken from one of the glass cases on the low
table.

On a wall behind TIFFANY, one of the large prints that previously
hung there has been taken down.

Revealed in the space behind  it is a large mirror. The camera
moves in towards this mirror.


71   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   ALCOVE   DAY

MALAHIDE and JULIA stand in a tiny and completely bare room. On the
wall in front of them is a large window through which we see a
back-view of TIFFANY in the obsession room.


72   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM    DAY

TIFFANY looks around the room generally and then turns her
attention completely to the LAMENT CONFIGURATION.

She picks it up and turns it around in her hands, studying each
of its faces intently.

She begins trying to move the interlinked pieces within it. At
first she has no success; the box appears to be one solid
construction with no internal movement possible.

She stops her attempts and studies it again for a moment, her face
still impassive. Then she gives a tiny smile and begins again.
Her movements are faster now, less tentative.

Suddenly, there is a click and one of the panels on-the box
slides out slightly. The little music-box tune begins to play.

To TIFFANY this is a marvelous reward - something the jigsaw
never offered - and she lets out a little sound in response,
somewhere between a sigh and a delighted giggle. It tempts her to
even greater skill and her delighted fingers fly over the box.
Another panel moves. Then two more. The tune is prettier and
fuller.


73   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   ALCOVE   DAY

MALAHIDE stares fixedly through the window, nervous but terribly
excited. He is breathing rapidly and shallowly.

Through the glass, TIFFANY's success continues. Small flashes of
intense blue light begin to buzz around the box. The room grows
darker and cracks begin to appear in its walls.

JULIA seems quietly amused - both by what is going on in the room
and by MALAHIDE's heated response to it. She glances from one to
the other, her eyes twinkling.

                            JULIA
                  You're sure this is what you
                  want?

MALAHIDE doesn't take his eyes from the window.

                            MALAHIDE
                  It's what I've ALWAYS
                  wanted. A view of ...
                  beyond.

He pauses. Perhaps he is being ungallant. He turns slightly
towards JULIA and takes her hand.

                            MALAHIDE
                  You were almost enough, Julia
                  but...I have to see. I have to
                  KNOW.

JULIA smiles indulgently. She nods.

                            JULIA
                  Oh, I quite understand.


74    INT.   OBSESSION ROOM     DAY

TIFFANY is completely engrossed in the box. She seems blissfully
unaware of the changes taking place in the room.

The cracks have widened in the walls and, in some places, pieces
of plaster have fallen away, revealing the slats beneath.

Blue light begins to stream into the room, ignoring the geography
of what should lie beyond its walls. Where the light comes
through the slats, it is as broad beams of light, given contrast
by the shadows of the slats. But it also comes through the
smaller cracks and enters the room in intensely bright and very
thin beams that criss-cross through the room almost like a laser
display.

Suddenly, TIFFANY's solution is complete. The central core of the
box rises up and twists itself around into its final position.


75   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   ALCOVE   DAY

MALAHIDE takes an almost involuntary step backward. His
excitement has now reached the pitch where it is beyond obvious
physical manifestation. He is perfectly still, his face perfectly
impassive.

                            MALAHIDE
                  She's done it.

                            JULIA
                  She certainly has.

                            MALAHIDE
                  It's coming.

                            JULIA
                  It certainly is.

MALAHIDE turns away to meet her eyes.

There is a beat or two where absolutely nothing happens.

The mirror explodes inwards into the alcove.


76   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   DAY

The room is filled with smoke and suffused with blue light.

Two of the walls simply part physically, revealing entrances into
the corridors of Hell. These corridors are lined with gray walls
and seem to run for a great distance.

TIFFANY still sits cross-legged in the middle of the floor,
staring about her in astonishment.

Surrounding her, in various parts of the room, are the four
CENOBITES from HELLRAISER.

The FEMALE CENOBITE smiles and advances towards TIFFANY.

The leader of the CENOBITES, PINHEAD raises a hand.

                            PINHEAD
                  Wait.

The FEMALE stops and looks questioningly at PINHEAD.

PINHEAD, at a more leisurely pace, crosses towards TIFFANY and
looks down at her. She stares back at him, the remnants of her
insanity a temporary defense against fear, her face registering
nothing.

PINHEAD looks up.

                            PINHEAD
                  No.

The FEMALE looks across at him.

                            CENOBITE
                  No?

PINHEAD shakes his head.

                            PINHEAD
                  No.

He glances down at TIFFANY again.

                            PINHEAD
                  It is not HANDS that call us...

He looks up and stares directly at the shattered two-way mirror.

                            PINHEAD
                  ... It is DESIRE.


77   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   ALCOVE   DAY

The wall opposite the shattered mirror has also opened up to
reveal a way into Hell.

MALAHIDE and JULIA are no longer in the alcove.

We hear the ringing of their footsteps. They are making their way
down the corridor.


78   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   DAY

The four CENOBITES have gone.

TIFFANY looks around the room again. She stares from one entrance
to the other. Her manner is reminiscent of when she is making
decisions during her solving of puzzles.


79   INT.   BLOOD-BOUDOIR   DAY

KIRSTY is still on the floor in the boudoir of blood. This room
too is now suffused with blue light and smoke. There are no
gateways to Hell in the walls but there are several cracks in the
plaster and these appear to be spreading.

KIRSTY moans and opens her eyes gingerly. She puts a hand to her
face, rubbing at the place where JULIA hit her.

Still a little groggy, she lifts herself slowly to a sitting
position, her legs stretched out. Only when she has blinked a few
times, shaken her head, and rubbed her jaw again, does full
consciousness return - at which point she looks quickly about the
room ( possibly expecting another attack from JULIA) and notices
the light and the smoke.

She has been in this atmosphere before. She knows precisely what
it means. Her mouth opens and her eyes grow nervous again.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, shit.

KIRSTY scrambles quickly to her feet and rushes through the door
to the stairs.


80   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM    DAY

KIRSTY enters the room just as TIFFANY is about to go down one of
the corridors. KIRSTY screams at her.

                            KIRSTY
                  NO!

TIFFANY stops, startled, and looks at the doorway and KIRSTY.

KIRSTY raises her hands in a placatory gesture and speaks more
softly.

                            KIRSTY
                  Wait. Wait.

KIRSTY begins to move into the room slowly and shakes her head
gently.

                            KIRSTY
                  Hey, remember me? From the
                  hospital? I was in the next room?

KIRSTY is rewarded with a small recognizing smile from TIFFANY,
KIRSTY returns the smile.

                            KIRSTY
                  You don't want to go down
                  there. You REALLY don't
                  want to go down there.

TIFFANY turns her head once more to look down the corridor and
then turns back to KIRSTY. For a second it looks as if KIRSTY's
persuasions have succeeded, but MALAHIDE's training has been too
thorough; TIFFANY knows a puzzle when she sees one. She smiles
once more at KIRSTY and then suddenly turns and disappears into
the corridor.

KIRSTY stands still for a moment, as if she can't quite believe
that TIFFANY has done it. She shakes her head - half in disbelief
and half in despair.

                            KIRSTY
                  Jesus Christ.

Pausing only to pick up the LAMENT CONFIGURATION from  where
TIFFANY has left it on  the floor, She heads straight for the
corridor and follows TIFFANY in.


81   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

We are looking straight down one of the very long corridors of
Hell.

It has the same architecture as the corridor that appeared in the
hospital room in HELLRAISER; walls of stained gray stone broken
up by vaguely medieval-looking arches.

KIRSTY comes into view, walking away from the camera. Ahead of
her, at an illogically far distance given that she entered the
corridor only seconds before KIRSTY, is TIFFANY.

KIRSTY breaks into a slight run, and calls out to the girl.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany. Wait!

Her voice has an unpleasant ring in the acoustics of these
corridors and echos horribly. KIRSTY pulls a face and doesn't
shout again. She increases her pace slightly.

Suddenly TIFFANY makes a sharp turn and enters an intersecting
corridor. KIRSTY is forced to increase her speed even more.

KIRSTY too makes the turn into another corridor. Even as she does
so, she sees TIFFANY disappearing again into yet another
intersection.

KIRSTY follows and, again, the same thing happens.

This happens several times and, always, KIRSTY never quite loses
sight of TIFFANY but never quite catches up with her either.

In short, TIFFANY's instincts were absolutely right; this too is
another puzzle. The girls are lost in a concrete maze, full of
twists and turns and labyrinthine windings.

After enough turns have been made to completely confuse KIRSTY's
sense of direction, she makes a final turn into one corridor and
sees something different.

At the end of this corridor is a blinding white light. As soon as
KIRSTY sees the light, the air is filled with beautiful
birdsong.

TIFFANY disappears into the light as soon as KIRSTY sees it.
Despite the light, despite the birdsong, KIRSTY is still
suspicious and shouts out.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany! Don't trust it! Don't
                  Trust it!

But it is too late. The girl is gone. KIRSTY follows-and vanishes
into the light.


82    INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

JULIA and MALAHIDE are seen in the corridors of the labyrinth.

MALAHIDE's face is full of delight. He is absolutely the
enchanted visitor.

JULIA, on the other hand, walks with the brisk assurance of one
on familiar territory.

The corridors that MALAHIDE sees are different to KIRSTY'S; they
are grotto-like, dotted with stalactites and stalagmites and not
immediately unattractive. The walls contain portals of a glass-
like substance at random intervals that emit blooming lights of
different colors and MALAHIDE peers eagerly into several of these.

In one, the view is like an aquarium. An alien fish swims past his
eyes. Its body resembles a human brain but it has pincer-like claws.
MALAHIDE presses his hand against the glass as the thing comes nearer.
Suddenly, from within its body, the thing produces a perfect
human forearm and hand and meets MALAHIDE's hand on the other
side of the glass.

MALAHIDE starts slightly but then keeps his hand there. He is
turning his head to call JULIA's attention to this marvel when
the thing suddenly forms a fist and begins to beat against the
glass with tremendous force.

MALAHIDE jumps back sharply, but the thing shatters the glass and
leaps out at him. He gasps and runs up the corridor, the thing
hopping after him on its one hand.

As they pass JULIA, she tuts with the slightly exasperated but
indulgent tone of a parent or a teacher. She steps on the thing,
squashing it flat. It emits a horrible death-cry.

                            JULIA
                  Do be careful.


83   INT.   HELL'S SITTING ROOM   DAY

White light fills the screen and KIRSTY steps through it into
view. Instantly the White light contracts and disappears.

KIRSTY finds herself standing in a beautiful family sitting room.

The room is bathed in the warm light of a perfect summer's day.
The birdsong KIRSTY heard earlier continues but is, if anything,
even more melodic, even more sweet.

The room is vaguely Edwardian in its decor; real wood furnishings
and decorative porcelain ornaments. There is a large wooden
dresser, on top of which are many photographs in old-fashioned
brass frames.

Despite herself, KIRSTY cannot resist a smile of pure pleasure at
the appearance of the room.

She touches some of the furniture, as if to assure herself it is
real.

She approaches the dresser and picks up one of the large framed
photographs. She gasps in pleasure.

We see the photograph. It is a family group and looks to be have
been taken ten to twenty years ago. It is of a man, a woman, and
a young girl of four or five.

The man is clearly LARRY, albeit a younger version, and the
little girl has dark, thick, slightly curly hair - just like
KIRSTY'S. The woman is beautiful and has similar hair to her
daughter.

KIRSTY's eyes prick with tears - but they are clearly tears of
happy memories. She smiles.

                            KIRSTY
                  Mommy...

KIRSTY puts down the photograph of her family and looks around
the room again. A troubled look crosses her face.

Despite the aparent Summer light in the room, KIRSTY suddenly
realises what it is that is odd.

She looks from wall to wall with mounting distress on her face.
There are no windows in the room. And no door.

At this point, the odd discordant note in the birdsong becomes
apparent. It is nothing too obvious at the moment - the total
effect is simply less sweet than it was.

KIRSTY looks back at the photograph and snatches it up, with a
look of concern.

The photograph has changed. It is now a wedding photo. The
wedding of LARRY and JULIA.

Suddenly the photograph begins to bleed. Blood pours from the
paper itself, pressing up and smearing against the glass-so that
it is momentarily framed blood, without a single trace of the
picture showing.  The blood begins to escape out of the frame,
trickling over the lip that holds the glass in place and dripping
onto KIRSTY's fingers.

With a cry of horror, KIRSTY drops the frame. It lands on the
floor and the glass shatters. The blood continues to flow. In
fact, now that the glass does not restrain it, it fairly
fountains out, spreading across the floor.

KIRSTY steps back and glances at the dresser. Blood is flowing
from every frame, pooling on the dresser and overflowing onto the
floor.

By now, the discordant elements in the birdsong are very much
predominant and, as KIRSTY sweeps all the frames off the dresser
and onto the floor with a scream of anguish, the birdsong gives
way completely to a hideous, dissonant shrieking.

KIRSTY throws her hands to her ears.

                            KIRSTY
                  Nooooo!

She rushes at one of the walls and begins beating it with her
fists.

The walls are soft and pulpy and give slightly as her fists
strike, like flabby flesh. KIRSTY stands back in disgust.

The wall visibly bruises before her eyes, swelling and purpling.

The light in the room, like the birdsong, has changed utterly. It
is not dark, but simply dull, featureless, and depressing.

KIRSTY turns away in disgust and finds that the whole room has
given in to decay. The sofas and chairs are mildewed and rotten,
the wooden furniture is ridden with woodworm and rot. A skinned rat
runs across the room beside the buckled and chipped skirting board.

A rotten leg gives way under a small chest and the bottom drawer
spills out, freeing a whole family of quite large spiders which
run wildly across the floor.

Suddenly the room begins to fill with smoke, churned up by an
ever-increasing intensity of wind. The smoke obscures the screen.


84   INT.   BARE CHAMBER   HELL

The smoke and wind subside but not entirely.

KIRSTY is standing in exactly the same position in a room of
exactly the same proportions, but which is completely empty and
which has walls of the same gray stone that the corridors do.

Suddenly, rising up from behind KIRSTY, comes PINHEAD.

                               PINHEAD
                  Ah, Kirsty. And we thought
                  we'd lost you.

KIRSTY swings round in terror. As the mist continues to clear,
she sees, advancing to join PINHEAD, the FEMALE CENOBITE and the
CHATTERER. Beyond them, it is now revealed, that this chamber has
no fourth wall; it gives directly onto the corridors

                               FEMALE CENOBITE
                  So sweet of you to come back.

KIRSTY begins to work furiously at the BOX she has brought from
MALAHIDE's house. It sent them away at the end of HELLRAISER.
She obviously hopes it will work again.

PINHEAD raises a hand and the box simply flies out of KIRSTY's
hands and hovers in the air between them. KIRSTY stares, open-
mouthed.

                            PINHEAD
                  How can it send us back, child?
                  We're already here. And so are you.

Suddenly PINHEAD works at the box himself - by remote control and
with dazzling skill.

He turns the box rapidly through positions KIRSTY and we have
never seen before - even opening it out at one stage into  a
large, two-dimensional square. Finally, it closes itself down -
but in a wholly new shape; a white, multi-faceted, diamond shape
- and drops back into KIRSTY's hands.

He stares at KIRSTY and makes a small gesture with his brow. It
is ALMOST cute. If anything, it resembles the cocky, aren't-I-
clever look STEVE gave KIRSTY after swallowing the cigarette in
HELLRAISER. Then his face assumes its normal deadly blankness.

KIRSTY shakes her head dumbly and begins to back into a corner,
hoping that if they converge on her, she might just be able to
slip around them and get back to the labyrinth.

                            KIRSTY
                  No! You... You can't! It wasn't
                  me...I didn't do it! I didn't
                  open the box!

                            FEMALE CENOBITE
                  Didn't open the box. And what was it
                  last time? Didn't know what the box
                  was. And yet we DO keep finding each
                  other, don't we?

                            PINHEAD
                  Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so
                  reluctant to admit it.

                            FEMALE CENOBITE
                  Perhaps you're teasing us. Are
                  you teasing us?

To some extent, KIRSTY's ploy is working. The CENOBITES are
moving closer together as they advance to the corner in which she
stands.

                            KIRSTY
                  But I didn't open it! I didn't!

                            PINHEAD
                  Then why are you here?

                            KIRSTY
                  I've come for my father!

KIRSTY shouts this with brave defiance. PINHEAD laughs in
response, a very unattractive sound.

                            PINHEAD
                  But he's in his own Hell, child
                  And quite unreachable.

Suddenly KIRSTY makes her break shouting out as she does so.

                            KIRSTY
                  I don't believe you!

It seems for a moment she has succeeded. She swings around the
side of the CENOBITES and begins to run across the chamber.
The CENOBITES do not move but suddenly, from nowhere a hook flies
across the room, attached to a metal chain. The hook buries
itself in the wall only inches in front of KIRSTY's face, the
chain pulled tight and barring her path. The wall begins to
bleed.

KIRSTY screams.

The CENOBITES turn to face her, but make no attempt to cross the
room to her new position.

                            PINHEAD
                  But it's true, He is his own Hell.
                  Just as you are in yours.

                            KIRSTY
                  And what about you?

PINHEAD almost smiles at the naivete of the question.

                            PINHEAD
                  It's different for us.

                            FEMALE CENOBITE
                  We've always been here.

                            PINHEAD
                  We have no more surprises.

Suddenly, as quickly as it came, the hook withdraws from the wall
and flies back into nothingness.

PINHEAD puts out his hand in an expansive gesture.

                            PINHEAD
                  But, please; feel free.
                  Explore. We'll always
                  be here...


85   INT.   CORRIDOR

KIRSTY can't quite believe this but she has no intention of
questioning it. She runs into the corridor and away, with
PINHEAD's last words echoing after her.

                            PINHEAD
                  ... we have Eternity to
                  know your flesh!

Delighted CENOBITE laughter follows her back into the labyrinth.

KIRSTY drops the transformed BOX into her pocket as she
begins running through the corridors again. The labyrinth
seems tighter now - the corridors shorter, the turns sharper.
Corner after corner we see KIRSTY turn.

Accompanying this tightening, the light in the corridors becomes
gradually murkier - not quite dark, more like the oppressive
colourlessness that descends before a thunderstorm breaks.

Occasionally there are little hissing noises from the walls
themselves, which are accompanied by small jets of dull and heavy
smoke escaping between the bricks.

Over all this, there grows in volume on the soundtrack a
rhythmic, labored, resonant sound - a sound somewhere between
breathing and machinery.

Suddenly, as KIRSTY turns one more corner, a hand reaches out to
touch her.

KIRSTY throws herself back against the far wall of the corridor,
unsure whether to fight or flee. Then her face relaxes. It is
TIFFANY.


86   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

In another corridor within the labyrinth, MALAHIDE and JULIA are
walking.

They too have found their way into the inner sections. They too
are in tighter, sharper corridors where the light is distressing.
They too hear the machine-like breathing noise. And what is
revealed behind the portals in the corridor walls is less
ambiguous in its unpleasantness; in one we see CHATTERER in some
Hell's equivalent of a beauty salon. He is being re-made. This
involves the scar tissue being manually peeled from the upper
part of his face to reveal beneath small, vicious, human eyes.

MALAHIDE's attitude has begun to change, as well. His nervousness
now clearly outweighs his delight. He' rushes on to the next
portal.

If the last room was a beauty salon, this is the orgy room. But
the orgy is very strange. It is a very dark room, filled with a
faint layer of smoke. In the background, a bound man is having
his chest licked by a kneeling woman. She pulls her face back for
a moment. Her tongue is horrifically long and studded with short,
sharp blades. The man's chest is stripped of skin where she has
been attending him. His face is a picture of ecstasy.

In the foreground, three people are buried up to their waists in
the floor. They are naked. The one in the middle is a woman, the
other two, men. The one in front of her faces her, the one behind
has his back to her back. They are all very, close. The men have
various hooks in their chests, connected by chains to the unseen
walls and their faces are impassive. The woman is unwounded and
her head flicks back and forth, as if in the grip of a sexual
climax of stunning ferocity. The movements of her head keep the
details of her features blurred until, finally, it turns to give
MALAHIDE a three-quarter profile and holds its position, its
mouth open, its eyes half-closed in pleasure. It is JULIA's face.


MALAHIDE gasps and pulls back from the portal. The camera TRACKS
back to reveal that JULIA is still in the corridor, just a few
yards in front of him

                            JULIA
                  Come. I have such sights to show you.

MALAHIDE shakes his head crazily from side to side and begins to
back away.

JULIA looks at him and walks toward him slowly. She smiles. She
strokes his cheek. She moves closer, gently slipping her arms around
him and molding her body to his. She extends her tongue and licks
lightly at his lower lip. He opens his mouth and returns the
kiss, pressing her body more firmly to him. The kiss becomes
quite passionate.


87   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

KIRSTY and TIFFANY are now walking together.

KIRSTY is talking to her as calmly as her sense of urgency will
allow.

                            KIRSTY
                  Do you see? You were RIGHT.
                  This IS a puzzle, too. But
                  WE'RE CAUGHT in the puzzle.

KIRSTY stops walking and catches hold of TIFFANY's arm. TIFFANY
stops, looks at the hand holding her arm, and then looks into
KIRSTY's eyes.

                            KIRSTY
                  Yeah?

TIFFANY smiles directly at KIRSTY and then returns her nod.

                            KIRSTY
                  Yeah?

TIFFANY nods again, more emphatically.

                            KIRSTY
                  Yeah!

KIRSTY throws her arms around TIFFANY and hugs her.


88   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

JULIA is leading MALAHIDE down a corridor which has intersections
every few yards on both of its sides.

JULIA walks past these shadowed entrances without pause, without
a single sidelong glance. She is clearly confident, clearly back
on her own turf.

MALAHIDE, on the other hand, glances nervously into every one
before moving on.

There is also one last portal he looks into. He is gazing into
a room where the floor is a vast, seething pool of maggots.
Suddenly, something breaks the surface. It would doubtless scream
were its mouth not full of maggots. It is BROWNING. His nightmare
has come true; his skin is producing the maggots in a constant,
spewing flow from numerous sores that pack his face.

MALAHIDE turns away and calls to JULIA.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Enough. God, that's enough. We
                  HAVE to go back.

JULIA smiles at him.

                            JULIA
                  Go back? What an earth makes
                  you think we can go back?

MALAHIDE's jaw drops.

                            MALAHIDE
                  I want to go back!

                            JULIA
                  Sorry, friend. No day trips to
                  Hell. Here you are. Here you
                  stay. And forward the only way
                  to go.

JULIA turns back and walks an down the corridor.

MALAHIDE, with a glance back at the maggot pool, turns after the
now departing JULIA.


89   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

KIRSTY and TIFFANY are walking warily along a corridor when,
suddenly, the corridor wall parts with a roar. Both girls jump,
and TIFFANY cries out.

A new, and very narrow corridor has been revealed. The GIRLS
stare down it. It culminates in a door. Despite being set in a
blank gray stone wall, the door is normal. But frightening -
because it is an exact replica of the front door of 55 LODOVICO
STREET, LARRY's house.

Before KIRSTY can react to this, a voice issues from beyond the
door.

                            VOICE
                  Kirsty!

KIRSTY stops dead in her tracks. She looks at the door and
moves toward it, walking slowly down the corridor. TIFFANY
follows.

                            KIRSTY
                      (Very Tentatively)
                  Daddy...?

 Only a low moan comes from behind the door.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany. Wait here. If I'm
                  not back real soon - get
                  out. Get home.

Leaving TIFFANY in the corridor, KIRSTY opens the door and steps
in.


90    INT.   THE BROTHERS' ROOM

The door that KIRSTY opens gives directly on to a room.

Like the SITTING ROOM earlier this appears to be an ordinary room
and not a stone wall chamber.

It's wall-papered walls were once white but are now yellowed and
old. Overhead there is an equally ancient four bladed wooden fan
that turns sluggishly.

In the middle of the floor is a small low table of vaguely
Eastern design.

On this table lie a hand of cards, face down, an empty and cloudy
tumbler, and a soiled ashtray.

Over by the far wall (the wall opposite to that containing the
door) there is a mattress on the floor. A body like shape on this
mattress is obscured by a heavy blanket that covers it.

To the side of the mattress a latticed wooden screen stands,
hiding whatever is behind it from those entering the room. If the
atmosphere of the room reminds us of anything it is of the seedy
bazaar where FRANK first bought the LAMENT CONFIGURATION.

We are looking at the door as it opens inwards and KIRSTY slowly
and nervously walks into the room.

KIRSTY advances into the room. She stares at the mattress ahead
of her. Above it written in blood on the wall, is the message she
saw in her vision. I AM IN HELL:HELP ME.

                            KIRSTY
                  daddy...

A low moan comes from the far end of the room. KIRSTY assumes it
issues from the figure hidden beneath the blanket and walks
nearer, lifting her arm in readiness to remove the blanket.

                            KIRSTY
                  Daddy. It's Kirsty...

There is no response. KIRSTY arrives at the mattress and pulls
the blanket back. She leaps backwards, her hand at her mouth
stifling a scream.

Lying on the bed is a husk like figure, vaguely female in shape.
Despite its appearance of long decay, it is dressed in vaguely
sexual garments of leather. Suddenly, the eyes pop open,
revealing a vague remnant of life.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh God.

KIRSTY hurriedly, throws the blanket back over it.

A voice issues into the room. It sounds like LARRY but, as we
shall see, it is not.

                            VOICE
                  No. Over here. Behind the
                  screen.

KIRSTY walks carefully around the screen, giving it a wide berth
in case of a trick.

There is a figure standing against the wall behind the screen. It
is deeply shadowed by the screen itself but is clearly male.

KIRSTY gulps back a sob and her eyes fill with tears.

                            KIRSTY
                  Daddy... ?

The figure leans slowly into the light, speaking as he does
so.

                            FRANK
                  That's it, baby. Come to
                  Daddy.

KIRSTY stands still. There is a second where her face registers
nothing. Then she screams.

                            KIRSTY
                  NO!

it is her UNCLE FRANK, back in his skin and dressed in white
shirt and jeans.

FRANK chuckles. KIRSTY backs away from him into the room. FRANK
puts out his right hand in a placatory gesture. KIRSTY realises
he is not moving after her. She also sees that his body is
curiously angled, the left side still in the deep shadow cast by
the screen. Is there something else there? Something she can't
quite see? FRANK's voice stops her wondering.

                            FRANK
                  What's the matter, Kirsty?
                  It's only Frank. It's only
                  Uncle Frank.

KIRSTY's anger at being tricked wins over her fear and distress
and she shouts at FRANK in fury.

                            KIRSTY
                  I should have known! I should've
                  known he wouldn't be here! This
                  place is only for filth like you!

FRANK sneers.

                            FRANK
                  Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone
                  to heaven, eh?

                            KIRSTY
                  Yes!

                            FRANK
                  Shit. Bull. Shit

FRANK pauses and smiles. Then he begins to move more fully into
the room, shifting his weight as he does so and dragging what was
hidden into the light. KIRSTY screams again.

FRANK's white shirt is cut off at the left shoulder. His arm is
bare and, from the elbow down to the wrist, joined to another
forearm. The flesh is completely fused, like that of siamese
twins. As FRANK moves into the room, the owner of the other arm
is revealed. It is his brother, LARRY. KIRSTY's father.

LARRY, like his brother, is dressed in a white shirt (cut off at
one shoulder) and jeans and, like his brother, has his skin back.
His face is frozen into a permanent expression of terror and he
seems incapable of any independent movement, simply being pulled
along by FRANK.

KIRSTY steps back in horror.

                            FRANK
                  See? He's here. You should learn
                  to believe your Uncle Frank.

                            KIRSTY
                  No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It
                  SHOULD'VE been a trick!

                            FRANK
                  'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here.
                  With me. We're the same. Brothers.
                  Equal and opposite. Pure appetite.
                  Pure banality. Too much feeling.
                  None at all.

KIRSTY's fear of FRANK is now outweighed by her contempt for his
argument.

                            KIRSTY
                  You're full of shit, Frank Cotton.
                  My Dad wasn't like that at all.
                  He could feel. He could love. He
                  loved ME.

KIRSTY's voice breaks.

                            KIRSTY
                  He...he loved me.

                            FRANK
                  Don't waste your tears. Look
                  at him!

Her hatred for FRANK gives KIRSTY her strength back.

                            KIRSTY
                  He loved me, you bastard! He
                  Loved me, he loved my mother.
                  He even loved that bitch you
                  betrayed him with!

FRANK begins to move towards KIRSTY again, LARRY dragging behind
him.

                            FRANK
                  Ah, Julia. She hasn't been to
                  see me recently. That's why
                  it's so nice to have you
                  here, baby. Daddy's little girl.
                  So pretty when she's upset. Come
                  to Daddy,

FRANK is very close to her, now. KIRSTY attempts to run across
the room. FRANK siezes her arm and throws her back against the
wall. He moves in close and presses against her. His voice is
midway between arousal and anger.

                            FRANK
                  Now don't be naughty, Kirsty. Or
                  I'll have to punish you first.
                  Perhaps you'd like that. Would
                  you like that?

KIRSTY screams and stares pleadingly, at the still frozen LARRY.

                            KIRSTY
                  Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!

                            FRANK
                  I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.

FRANK leans in to kiss the terrified KIRSTY.

Suddenly, a hand appears at FRANK's throat and hurls him off
KIRSTY. It is LARRY, roused by his daughter's cries.

                            LARRY
                  Get your fucking hands off
                  my daughter, you bastard!

Suddenly, the room, previously full of slow movements and
tension, is full of furious, violent action as the fused brothers
kick, tear, and punch at each other in a paroxysm of killing
hatred.


91   INT.   THE CENTRE OF HELL

MALAHIDE and JULIA are at the end of a corridor. They turn into
an open space. A vast open space. It is desert-like in its
expanse, almost vanishing into infinity at its furthest reaches.
It is criss-crossed by catwalks, on one of which MALAHIDE and
JULIA now stand. Beside these catwalks, the ground falls away
into mile-deep, dark, abysses.

Above the catwalks, dominating the huge space, is the master of
the labyrinth.

The master, LEVIATHAN, is a monumentally huge, white, multi-
faceted diamond, spinning on its own axis, entirely unsupported
by any physical means, above its territory.

Apart from its very immensity, the most unsettling thing about
LEVIATHAN are the beams of black light that shine out from the
corners of all its many facets. Due to the fast spinning, these
beams shoot and swoop around the chamber, like a negative laser
display of dazzling complexity.

The sound that has been in the corridors is now magnified. It is
the sound of LEVIATHAN's breath.

MALAHIDE has walked the last few yards like a man in shock. Now
a black beam strikes his face and images of horror flash before
his eyes at almost subliminal speed. His face suddenly crumbles
into an expression of incredulous terror, he makes a noise
halfway between screaming and retching, and drops to his knees by
the edge of the catwalk.

Unfortunately, this allows him to look down into LEVIATHAN's pit.
Looking down with him, we are given a sudden and vertiginously
sickening realization of Hell's immensities. There is a drop of
miles visible down the pit and, all the way down, as far as the
eye can see, there are other catwalks cutting across the pit at
various angles.

MALAHIDE looks back up, his scream renewed by his sight of the
pit. Two or three of the beams of black light flit across his
face, filling his eyes with more subliminal images of horror as they
pass; a child, a knife, and a dead animal; a naked woman whose
private parts are made of sharp, oily, metal; perfect hands
ending in crumbling, leprous fingers.

Suddenly, LEVIATHAN stops spinning. Effortlessly. Instantly. Two
more beams are projected at MALAHIDE but, as they come within a
few yards of him, they become writhing pink limbs that fly out,
sieze MALAHIDE and lift him into the air. He screams out.

                            MALAHIDE
                  No! No! Julia! Help me!

MALAHIDE is held in the air as JULIA replies.

                            JULIA
                  But you WANTED this. You wanted
                  to SEE. You wanted to KNOW. And
                  here it is. The heart of Hell.
                  Leviathan.

As she says this two of the thing's facets part to reveal a raw
and gaping cavity lined with angry, sore-looking purple flesh
directly behind the dangling MALAHIDE.

The purple and pink walls of this flesh gash peel apart and open
in various places to reveal blades, hooks and needles at the end
of various vestigial limbs.

The limbs holding MALAHIDE draw him back inexorably into this
cavity.

He has one last moment to meet JULIA's eyes.

                               JULIA
                  Why do you think I was allowed
                  to go back? For YOU? No, it
                  wanted souls. And I brought you.
                  And you wanted to KNOW. Now you're
                  both happy.

MALAHIDE is now held within the walls of the gash. He opens his
mouth for one final scream but one of the tiny needle-topped
limbs flies at his mouth and sews his lips together with heavy
blue wire before he can utter it.

His eyes widen in both agony and horror.

JULIA smiles.

                            JULIA
                  Goodbye, Doctor. It's been real.

The gash heals itself, closing MALAHIDE within.

Despite the gash having closed over MALAHIDE, the leathery flesh
that covers that area is a mass of movement, ripples and bumps.
Small rips and gashes appear and disappear on its surface, allowing
us occasional and partial glimpses of MALAHIDE and what is
happening to him.

At one stage MALAHIDE's hand and forearm appear. A long deep,
running cut has been made down the arm and the flesh peeled and
folded back, revealing the meat and the muscle beneath. As we
watch, two of the tiny operating limbs sew the flaps of flesh,
still folded back, to the rest of the arm, leaving the wound open
and un-healable.

Another gash opens and MALAHIDE's face is visible. Here too the
needles are at work, diving into and out of his flesh in a
complicated sewing pattern that is finally pulled together
beneath one ear, leaving MALAHIDE's features permanently pulled
out of shape and decorated with running stitches of metal wire.

Again, MALAHIDE's torso appears, naked. Two large triangular
blades make deep parallel slashes down his chest. Two different
limbs appear but these have sucker-like tips rather than metallic
ones. They fasten onto the new cuts, as if battening. Instead
they are injecting - as becomes apparent when MALAHIDE's skin
turns blue.

The blueness, the conscious disfigurement, and the almost
decorative open wounds should serve to convey that what is
happening to MALAHIDE is not simply torture; he is being
transformed into a CENOBITE.

JULIA watches with avid interest.


92   INT.   BROTHERS' ROOM

LARRY and FRANK are fighting furiously, tumbling around the
room. LARRY is fuelled by righteous anger and revenge but FRANK
has had more experience of dirty fighting.

At one stage their free hands each have hold of the other man by
the throat and are rolling along one of the walls, each trying to
establish the dominant grip.

They smash violently against one of the walls in the room. It
gives and they fall through into the next room.


93   INT.   KNIFE ROOM

This is a small square room. With the exception of the doorway
to the BROTHERS ROOM, every inch of the walls is covered
with sharp and deadly-looking double-bladed knives -ie One blade
is buried in the wall up to a central hilt/handle and the other
blade juts out menacingly into the room.

The two brothers tumble into the room. Their grips loosened by
their fall through the wall, they land on the floor and
rise to their feet, staring at each other but taking in
the vicious nature of the room as well.

                            FRANK
                  How convenient.

KIRSTY comes through and gasps as she sees the walls.

                            LARRY
                  Stay there, baby. Don't
                  come in.

                            FRANK
                  Yes. Stay there. I'll be with
                  you in a minute.

LARRY and FRANK trade blows.

FRANK lands a powerful blow to LARRY's jaw. It straightens LARRY
up and FRANK slams the flat of his hand against his brother's chest.

LARRY flies backwards. He flings out his arm to balance
himself but he is nearer to the wall than he thinks and the
impetus of his fall drives his arm onto the knives.

LARRY cries out. FRANK grins and prepares to force his wounded
brother completely onto the knives.

Suddenly KIRSTY flies across the room at FRANK and beats at his
back with her fists.

FRANK snarls and, without turning around completely, flings her
away from him. KIRSTY goes flying but lands just safely short of
the deadly walls.

LARRY, in the pause KIRSTY gave him and galvanized by her example,
has found more strength. He pulls his arm painfully forward, clear
of the knives, and throws himself to the side, forcing FRANK onto
the knives. With a vicious push, LARRY impales his brother
completely.

FRANK howls, loud and long.

Without pausing, LARRY pulls a knife free from the wall and, with
one vicious slice, separates himself from his brother.

LARRY rushes to KIRSTY and helps her to her feet. They embrace.

There is a cry of horror off-camera. We pull out. TIFFANY has
followed her friend. She stares in shock at LARRY's wounded arm
and at the impaled FRANK.


94   INT.   THE CENTRE OF HELL

JULIA is being given more glimpses of the transforming MALAHIDE.

The major surgery seems to be complete. There are no spinning
blades of needles in sight as the gashes open. MALAHIDE's head is
completely bald and his face, like the rest of his skin is blue.
The only new sophistications are that his upper and lower eyelids
have been stretched wide and stapled to his face and forehead,
and that a new mouth has been sliced into what was his cheek
before his features were pulled permanently to one side.

Over the sound of LEVIATHAN's breath and the CENOBITE
machinery still at work on MALAHIDE, FRANK's howl is heard.

JULIA's head turns to the direction of this new sound.

                            JULIA
                  Frank...

She turns away without a backward glance and moves back into the
corridors.


95   INT.   THE KNIFE ROOM

FRANK is still impaled on the knives,  but his anguished howl has
Become  small whimpers of complaint (with, given his history with
the  CENOBITES,  perhaps  the tiniest note of pleasure in  there,
too)

KIRSTY,  LARRY and TIFFANY are now gathered together to one side
of the room near the door that leads to the corridor. They should
leave, but a kind of sick fascination keeps them watching FRANK.

FRANK realises only leverage will pull him free of the knives and
lifts his forearms up as much as they are free to.

He turns his palms to face the knives and, with a growl of self-
encouragement, drives them deeply onto the knives so that he can
begin to push the rest of his impaled body backwards.

It takes several seconds and much pain for him to succeed, but
succeed he does. He flops backwards into the room.

Several of the knives have stayed in him, rather than the wall -
his chest is decorated, or armed, with many blades.

Just as FRANK begins to stand, and just as LARRY and the girls
snap out of it and are about to leave, the door from the CONVEYOR
BELT ROOM opens and JULIA walks into the room.

KIRSTY and LARRY gasp. FRANK gives a slow smile.

                            JULIA
                  Well, well. All my family
                  together again. How very
                  sweet.

                            FRANK
                     (delighted/flattered)
                  Julia.

                            JULIA
                           (Flatly)
                  Frank.

                            FRANK
                  I knew you'd come.

                            JULIA
                  You knew?

                            FRANK
                  Yes. You're a girl who
                  remembers her promises.

                            JULIA
                  Oh, I do. I do.

FRANK grins, his grin taking in LARRY, KIRSTY and TIFFANY as well
as JULIA. He extends an arm to JULIA.

                            FRANK
                  And I know how much I mean
                  to you. Come here.

JULIA does not move.

                            FRANK
                  Come here. Kiss me. And
                  then...

He glances meaningfully at the others, perhaps stroking a blade
of one of the knives in his chest.

                            FRANK
                  ... we'll have a real family
                  re-union.

Suddenly, surprisingly, LARRY laughs. He is genuinely amused.

                            LARRY
                  Jesus Christ, FRANK. I don't
                  believe you. You don't know
                  her at all do you? You still
                  think you're in charge.

JULIA still has not moved.

                            FRANK
                  Of course I am. She BELONGS
                  to me.

JULIA begins to cross the room to him.

                            KIRSTY
                  For God's sake! He KILLED you!

JULIA doesn't pause. FRANK grins.

                            FRANK
                  She's forgiven me that. Haven't
                  you?

JULIA is now next to him.

                            JULIA
                  Do you really need to ask?

FRANK laughs.

                            FRANK
                  Show them.

 JULIA glances at the knives. FRANK shrugs.

                            FRANK
                  Just a small inconvenience, babe.

JULIA shifts position so she is standing behind him. She wraps
her arms around him, one stroking his belly, the other across his
shoulders.  FRANK leans his head back and twists it slightly.
They kiss.

JULIA removes her arm from his stomach and slips it behind him.
Nothing happens for a second and then, suddenly, FRANK's whole
body spasms.  We almost think it may be with pleasure until he
breaks from the kiss and we see the confused expression on his
face - and the blood bubbling at his mouth.

There is a ripping, bursting sound and JULIA's hand emerges from
his chest, covered in his blood.  Clutched in her hand is his
ruptured, still pumping heart.

                            LARRY
                  Jesus!  Out.  Out!

He shepherds the girls quickly through the door to the corridor.

FRANK's body begins to twitch.  JULIA holds it tightly.


96   INT  CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

They reach the end of the corridor.  It terminates in a T-
junction.

TIFFANY automatically heads in one direction.  KIRSTY makes to
follow, but LARRY hesitates.

                            LARRY
                  Wait a minute.  Why are we
                  following her? Who is this?

                            KIRSTY
                  This is Tiffany

KIRSTY shrugs.

                            KIRSTY
                  ... She's good at puzzles.

                            LARRY
                  Fine.

They take the turn TIFFANY has indicated.


97   INT  THE KNIFE ROOM

JULIA still holds FRANK tight.

Slowly, she raises the hand which holds his heart until it is in
front of his face.  FRANK's eyes are glassing over but he can
still see.

                            JULIA
                  Nothing personal, babe.

Without ceremony, she bursts the heart with one quick squeeze.


100    INT  THE CENTRE OF HELL

LARRY, KIRSTY and TIFFANY come running toward the camera.
Initially oblivious to the fact that the corridor they were
running along has widened and the walls retreated.  Suddenly,
they come to a stunned halt together, staring ahead of them with
awestruck faces.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh. My. God.

The camera moves around them to take in what they see.  They are
of course in the central chamber of LEVIATHAN.

LEVIATHAN is spinning again, the black beams flying around the
chamber.

TIFFANY screams. KIRSTY grabs her.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany, listen.  You've solved
                  it. But we've got to solve it
                  the OTHER way.  See?  See?
                  We've got to get out.

TIFFANY is frozen.

                            LARRY
                  Come on!

LEVIATHAN spins, the beams fly.

                            KIRSTY
                  Please!  Tiffany, Please!
                  Get us out!  Take us home,
                  please!

TIFFANY nods. They are just about to leave when LEVIATHAN stops
spinning.

A large beam flies down , carrying an object which lands on the
catwalk before the HUMANS, who all take a step or two backwards.
The beam withdraws.
The object at first resembles a large and bloody plastic bag, but
then internal movement begins to rip at this covering.  Hands
appear out of the rips and complete the removal.  We realise that
the bag-like thing was a kind of caul, a membranous after-birth
that some creatures produce their young in.

The thing inside completes its escape and stands clear of the
shredded caul.  Like a new-born child, it is stained and soiled
with amiotic fluids and blood.  But it is not a new born child.

It is a NEW CENOBITE.  And it used to be MALAHIDE.  The
transformation we caught glimpses of is now complete.  Its skin
is entirely blue, its head entirely bald.  The decorative wounds
and tortures we saw being applied are all present;  its flesh is
peeled back in various places, its features are threaded and
distorted by, wire, its eyelids are stapled open.

For a second it stands and regards the HUMANS before it.

TIFFANY gasps in recognition.

KIRSTY too knows what it was.

                            KIRSTY
                  Malahide ...

For some reason, KIRSTY draws from her pocket the photo she took
from the OBSESSION ROOM. She stares at it.

                            KIRSTY
                  Jesus Christ!  Of course ...

The MALAHIDE CENOBITE stretches its arms and flexes its fingers.

                            MALAHIDE
                  And to think I hesitated ...

It looks at the HUMANS again, its gaze finally settling on the
still shocked TIFFANY.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Tiffany. Come. I have a whole new
                  world of puzzles for you to enjoy ...

It reaches out its hand to her.

                            MALAHIDE
                  A whole new world of pleasures
                  for you to endure.

TIFFANY, confused and used to obeying her doctor's voice,
tentatively stretches out her arm to meet the MALAHIDE
CENOBITE's.

LARRY suddenly walks between TIFFANY and MALAHIDE.  The
expression on his face is strange; it is not fear, nor defiance.
It is simpler than that.  He is really, really pissed off.

                            LARRY
                  No.  I've had enough of this shit.
                  Who the hell are you?

                            KIRSTY
                  It's ...

LARRY waves a hand at her, but keeps his eyes on
MALAHIDE.

                            LARRY
                  Never mind.  Never mind.

He points a finger at MALAHIDE's face, which is attempting a
version of PINHEAD's imposing glacial stars, but frankly, isn't
quite making it.

                            LARRY
                  Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.

Suddenly, he forms a fist with his unwounded arm and smashes it
straight into MALAHIDE's face.  MALAHIDE is completely decked.

LARRY grabs TIFFANY by the shoulders and speaks
urgently to her.

                            LARRY
                  O.K.  You've done it before.  You
                  can do it again.  GET US OUT OF
                  HERE!

The three of them run back up the catwalk.

LEVIATHAN spins wildly and a myriad of black beams flow from it.
As they shine into the catwalk they become limbs like those that
captured MALAHIDE, but all with different tips; some are organic,
vicious mouths, some are hooks or blades, some are faces, some
are (as if LEVIATHAN Is too angry to be thinking straight)
beautiful flowers.

The limbs fly up the catwalk, but the HUMANS have gained too
great a start.  The limbs retract rapidly into the black lights.

MALAHIDE staggers to his feet, just as LEVIATHAN re-directs its
energy into forming and projecting one much fatter limb.  It is
dirty pink and segmented, like a vast earthworm.  The end peels
back as it flies toward MALAHIDE, revealing a cruel, metallic,
and rapidly-spinning surgical saw.

Just as MALAHIDE stands up straight, the limb smashes into the
back of his skull.  There is a distressing WHIRRING noise as
the limb seals itself fleshily to MALAHIDE's skull and the former
surgeon twitches and dances in horrible involuntary movements as
LEVIATHAN takes over what little mind remains.


101   INT  CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

KIRSTY, TIFFANY and LARRY are running, TIFFANY making the
decisions as to direction.

Down one corridor, blades and knives jut out from the opposite
walls at random intervals and they have to weave at high speed
between them. They negotiate the corridor successfully but, just
as KIRSTY, bringing up the rear, emerges from it, she stumbles
and half-falls. The re-structured BOX falls from her pocket and
rolls back a few feet up the corridor.

TIFFANY, who is nearest to her, helps her to her feet and, as she
does so, catches sight of the BOX (or white diamond, as it is
now). She makes as it to go and get it. KIRSTY holds her arm.

                               KIRSTY
                  No. Come on. We have to get
                  out of here.

TIFFANY moves away with KIRSTY, but not without a backward glance
and a puzzled expression.

They all make another turning. Suddenly, when they are about
halfway down this next corridor, a new gap opens up behind them
in the wall and a terrible sucking noise is heard.  Corridor
debris disappears into the vacuum.

Luckily, LARRY has reached the end of the corridor and grasps the
corner with one hand, seizing KIRSTY's hand with the other.
KIRSTY grabs TIFFANY and the three of them flatten themselves
against the wall, fighting against the suction.  The force is
tremendous and LARRY's finger are slowly losing hold.


102   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

CLOSE UP on a hand picking up the re-structured BOX from the
corridor floor they have just left.


103   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

The sucking force is growing stronger by the second. Not only is
LARRY's right hand losing its grip on the edge of the wall, but
his left arm - stretched tight as it clings to KIRSTY and, via
her, TIFFANY - is bleeding profusely again.


Suddenly, JULIA appears at the top of the corridor next to LARRY.
In her hand is the white diamond BOX that KIRSTY had let drop.
She stays just out of range of the sucking wind.  She stares at
LARRY's weakening fingers and smiles.

                            JULIA
                  Oh, poor Larry.  You never
                  could hold on to anything
                  for very long, could you?

Suddenly, audaciously, his face set in a scowl of anger, LARRY
lets go of the wall.  Before she realises what is happening, he
has grabbed JULIA's wrist and pulled her off her feet into the
corridor. He lets go almost immediately and with a superhuman
effort grabs at the corner again before the wind can claim him
and the girls.

JULIA is not so lucky; without support or foothold, she is seized
by the wind and hurtles to the gap in the wall.

She manages to brake herself by flinging her arms out to either
side of her. For a moment she is hold there and then the pressure
begins to draw her in.

In her left hand she still holds the BOX, but her right hand is
only a few inches from TIFFANY's left.

TIFFANY reaches her hand to her, not knowing JULIA as the others
do. Their fingers just manage to interlock when JULIA's face
registers a disbelieving shock.

There is a terrible ripping sound. JULIA's new skin, so recently
gained, is giving up its hold and has ripped right up the spine.
JULIA is drawn from it.

                            JULIA
                  NOOOOOOOOOO!

With a final, slurping sound, the skinned woman slips from the
skin and disappears down the new corridor.

The momentary break in tension allows LARRY to make one last
effort. He rounds the corner and pulls the girls after him.
TIFFANY, finally, realising what has happened, screams in terror
and disgust, especially when she looks at what she has brought round
the corner in her hand. She drops JULIA's skin to the floor as
the three of them scramble to their feet and begin to run again.

Still clutched in the skin's hollow fingers is the white diamond BOX.

As they turn another corner, they see, very far in the distance,
a glimmer of light. TIFFANY points excitedly.

                            KIRSTY
                  My God, it's her room!

                            LARRY
                  Let's go!

He starts urging the girls down the corridor - a long and very
narrow one - but KIRSTY shows some resistance.

                            KIRSTY
                  No. No, there's something
                  wrong...

Before they can discuss it, a new rushing sound is heard. They
look back.

Hurtling towards them is the ENGINEER from HELLRAISER.

TIFFANY screams.

                            LARRY
                  Jesus. O.K. No more arguments.
                  Just RUN!

They begin one last panic-fuelled run down the narrow corridor,
the ENGINEER at their heels.

The sequence is equivalent to KIRSTY's pursuit by the ENGINEER in
HELLRAISER, the twist here being that as they approach the entrance
into TIFFANY's room the walls of the corridor, already thin, begin
to close together.

LARRY is bringing up the rear (the corridor is now so narrow only
single file is possible) and he can almost feel the ENGINEER'S
breath on his neck.

                            LARRY
                  Go. Go. Go. Go. Go!!

Finally, almost impossibly, they reach the gap in the wall.
TIFFANY tumbles through, then KIRSTY, and finally LARRY. Less
than a micro-second after LARRY has made it, the walls seal
themselves.


104   INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM    (2nd VERSION)   DAY

As we see clearly the room they have come into, we perhaps share
the feeling that KIRSTY expressed in the corridor; Something Is
Wrong.

The tiles that make up the floor are patterned as before but the
individual tiles are larger. The room itself seems more spacious,
the ceiling higher.

There is a bowl of flowers by the window. The flowers were in
full bloom before their trip to Hell but now they seem long dead.

The audience have to notice most of this for themselves because
LARRY, KIRSTY, and TIFFANY are too relieved by, and tired from,
their escape to take this in immediately. LARRY seats himself in
the chair, KIRSTY perches on the end of TIFFANY's bed. TIFFANY
however walks straight across to her window. She is the first to
notice anything. She stares at the flowers.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany ... ?

KIRSTY rises from the bed and joins TIFFANY by the window.

                            KIRSTY
                  But these were ... Daddy?

LARRY rises to his feet. Just as he stands, a fleeting expression
of bewilderment crosses his face. He strokes at his right arm
with an unconscious gesture as he crosses the room.

KIRSTY doesn't look at her father right away.

                            KIRSTY
                  These flowers. I saw them just...

She looks at her father. A sea of sweat has broken out on his
brow and face as he stares intensely at the flowers. KIRSTY's
voice slows, begins to trail off.

                            KIRSTY
                  ...the day ...before... yesterday
                  Daddy? Daddy!

LARRY's eyes close. His entire face screws up as if an
excruciating pain just hit him. He clamps his arm across his
chest, the hands clutching his shoulders. He opens his eyes and
looks at KIRSTY for a second, his expression one of surprise.
Then his eyes roll up into the sockets and he collapses to the
floor.

TIFFANY has hardly had time to turn from the bowl of flowers
before KIRSTY is kneeling by her father.

                            KIRSTY
                  Daddy!

LARRY is unconscious. TIFFANY gasps. KIRSTY looks up at her.

                            KIRSTY
                  Get help.

TIFFANY's eyes widen. She rushes to the door and disappears into
the corridor. Within two seconds we hear an emergency alarm go
off and TIFFANY re-enters the room.

                            KIRSTY
                  Pass me a pillow.

TIFFANY does so and KIRSTY places it under the head of LARRY,
whose lips are now blue and who is breathing very shallowly.
KIRSTY looks up at TIFFANY, despair in her eyes.

                            KIRSTY
                  What do you do? I just don't
                  know what to do.

TIFFANY shakes her head helplessly.

Suddenly, the door to the room flies open and two INTERNS - maybe
Stan and Ollie from the carnival sequence - come in, complete with
stretcher and gurney. They assess the situation with a glance and
it is serious enough to make one of them break their professional
silence.

                            INTERN
                  Coronary arrest. Let's be quick.

They are good at their job - within seconds LARRY is secured on
the gurney and they head for the door, KIRSTY and TIFFANY behind
them. The following exchanges are spoken on the move.

                            KIRSTY
                  Is he going to be 0.K.?

                            INTERN
                  We just can't say.
                  O.R.'s on standby. They'll
                  do what they can.

                            KIRSTY
                  But it's bad?

The INTERNS exchange a glance and decide honesty is best.

                            INTERN
                      (gently but flatly)
                  Yeah. It's bad.


105   INT.   ELEVATOR   DAY

The elevator is uncomfortably full, KIRSTY and TIFFANY squashed
up against the back while the INTERNS hold the gurney in the
centre.

The elevator is descending. The ride seems to take longer than it
should, even though they are going to basement level;like the
look of TIFFANY's room, it's ALMOST normal but just different
enough to make us slightly uneasy in an un-focused way.

Eventually, though, it does come to a stop. TIFFANY squeezes
KIRSTY's shoulder sympathetically (NOTE. RE: TIFFANY's character
- it should be clear to the audience by this stage that, though
she is still mute, TIFFANY is now a responsive, more rounded
character)

The INTERNS wheel the gurney out of the elevator and the girls
follow.


106   INT.   BASEMENT CORRIDOR   DAY

The basement corridor is long, cavernous, and not very pleasant.
It has a grimier, more uncared-for look than the upper floors and
the high ceiling is covered with an intricate system of naked
pipes and conduits.

The INTERNS wheel LARRY down this corridor, going so fast that
KIRSTY and TIFFANY are continually breaking into a trot to keep
up with them.

At the far and of the corridor are a set of double doors. The
nearer they all get to these doors, the tackier the corridor
seems to become. The walls now have pipes running over them, as
well as the ceiling, and several of these pipes are dripping
water into small pools on the corridor floor. The sound of these
drips is artificially loud on the soundtrack.

Finally, the doors are reached and the INTERNS, LARRY, KIRSTY and
TIFFANY disappear through them.


107   INT.   PRE-OP ROOM    DAY

This is a small ante-room to the operating room which is beyond a
further set of double doors. Without ceremony the two INTERNS
pass straight across this room to those doors and wheel the
gurney through, one of them throwing back a parting remark to
KIRSTY.

                            INTERN
                  Wait out here. A doctor
                  will talk to you when
                  we know more.

The double doors part and close, giving just a glimpse of the
operating room beyond, all lights, monitors and whirring machinery,
and the several gowned and masked experts attending to LARRY.

As the doors close, KIRSTY turns to TIFFANY, expecting a long
wait before anyone comes to speak to them. Surprisingly, though,
the doors open again almost immediately and two figures step
through. They, too, are masked and gowned in surgical green and
very little of them is visible.

                            KIRSTY
                  Is he going to be all right?

                            1st GOWNED FIGURE
                      (matter of factly)
                  No. He's not going to be
                  all right.

KIRSTY staggers visibly, shocked by this bluntness.

                            KIRSTY
                  Wh...

                            1st GOWNED FIGURE
                  No. He's going to die. He's got
                  a ruptured aorta. He's going to
                  die in agony.

As he makes this speech, the mask of his colleague stains rapidly
with blood, as if it is literally pouring from its mouth.
Simultaneously, his own mask is slowly pierced by a score of nails
bursting through from beneath.

TIFFANY screams.

The 1st GOWNED FIGURE pulls the mask and cap away from its face -
It is PINHEAD. His colleague does the same. It is the FEMALE
CENOBITE.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, Fuck.

She's had too much experience with these two to hesitate. She
grabs TIFFANY's arm and bursts through the double doors to the
corridor.


108   INT.   BASEMENT CORRIDOR   DAY

We are now looking along the corridor in the other direction -
back towards the elevator.

KIRSTY and TIFFANY come into shot, running rapidly along the
corridor.

As they make their way, a rumbling, flatulent sound is heard from
the overhead pipes and they all begin to drip blood not water.

We hear the sound of the doors flying open behind them.

KIRSTY and TIFFANY reach the elevator. KIRSTY presses frantically
on the call button, while TIFFANY looks behind them with
frightened eyes.

                            KIRSTY
                  C'mon. C'MON!

The sound of steadily-pacing, purposeful feet is heard coming up
the corridor, getting louder, coming closer.

KIRSTY begins hammering on the closed elevator doors. TIFFANY
stifles a cry with her hand.

                            KIRSTY
                  COME ON!!

Suddenly, the doors fly open. KIRSTY and TIFFANY tumble into the
elevator.


109   INT.   BASEMENT CORRIDOR   DAY   (GIRLS' P.O.V.)

We see the door-frame of the elevator and the floor buttons
beside it and, looking down the corridor through the open
elevator doors, PINHEAD and the FEMALE CENOBITE marching towards
us.

We also see KIRSTY'S finger jabbing frantically at the floor
buttons. The doors are not closing. The CENOBITES are getting
very close.

Finally, just as PINHEAD breaks from his determined but medium-
paced stride and speeds up eagerly for the last two or three
yards, extending his arm as he does so, the door slams shut
across our vision and we hear the elevator machinery start up.


110    INT.   ELEVATOR   DAY

KIRSTY leans against the back wall of the elevator, breathing
heavily. TIFFANY stands very still in the middle, a frozen
expression of fear on her face.

                            KIRSTY
                  Faster, you bastard, faster!

She slams her fist against the elevator wall. The elevator
stops. Its lights flicker.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm
                  sorry. I didn't mean it.

The elevator starts again.

                            KIRSTY
                  It's 0.K. They can't beat an
                  elevator. Not upstairs. It'll be O.K.

The lift stops, but this time it's where they want it. KIRSTY's
finger hesitates over the DOOR OPEN button.

                            KIRSTY
                  It'll be O.K.

She presses the button.


111   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   DAY   (GIRLS P.O.V.)

We are looking at the closed elevator door.  When it opens we
will be looking down the corridor on the main hospital floor -
the floor with the girls' rooms on.

The door flies open. CHATTERER II lunges in at them.

KIRSTY screams, but because of the eagerness of his lunge they
are able to get around him as his impetus carries him to the back
of the elevator.


112   INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR      DAY

The door begins to close as the girls straighten up in the
corridor and as CHATTERER II turns around to come back out at
them.

He tries to put his hand out to stop the door closing, but
succeeds only in trapping his fingers in the door.

KIRSTY, as soon as the doors began to close, had hit the DOWN
button. Now, she squeals with horror as she realises what is
about to happen.

The elevator begins to descend - we can tell this because
CHATTERER II's fingers move down to the floor and are then
sliced off.

The GIRLS run off down the corridor.

                            KIRSTY
                  This way. Short cut.

They turn into a set of double doors leading to a large ward.


113   INT.   LARGE WARD   DAY

KIRSTY and TIFFANY enter the ward at a run and then slow down to
a confused and horrified walk.

Every bed in the ward is occupied, some by men, some by women,
and every patient has in their hands, and is busily working on, a
LAMENT CONFIGURATION.

Despite this collective work-in, the BOXES obviously still have
the vicious characteristics they have previously demonstrated
when used individually - as is witnessed by the ten or so patients
who are struggling on with their work despite having one or two
hooks and chains connecting their flesh to their BOX.

KIRSTY and TIFFANY move slowly down the room, a look of
incredulity on both their faces.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, Christ. This isn't just
                  personal anymore.

TIFFANY nods slowly, her eyes flicking back and forth across the
ward.

Suddenly, the wheelchair patient from the earlier scene in this
ward, who has been between two of the beds on one side of
the ward, cuts across the GIRLS' path. He too has a BOX on his
lap. As he passes in front of them, he looks at them, giggles in
an unmistakably insane fashion, and gives them a conspiratorial
wink. Then he simply proceeds to the other side of the ward.

A second or so after this, as the GIRLS edge down the middle of
the room, they hear a rushing sound behind the double doors they
are heading towards.

Suddenly, the doors slam open and revealed in the doorway is
MALAHIDE.

But he is not standing there. He is hovering about two feet off
the floor. The umbilical limb that connects him to LEVIATHAN is
still at the back of his skull. His face is contorted in a grin
of manic glee as he floats three or four feet into the ward.

                            MALAHIDE
                  The Doctor is in!

He laughs, and the sound is far from human. KIRSTY and TIFFANY
stare at him.

                            TIFFANY
                  Oh, shit.

KIRSTY looks sharply at TIFFANY for a second,  as if she is about
to comment on her re-found voice, but instead simply nods. She
takes her friend's hand and the GIRLS begin to walk very slowly
backwards to the far end of the ward.

MALAHIDE is too enraptured of his new power to pay attention to
specific victims and so makes no move to stop the GIRLS' slow
retreat.

Suddenly his palms erupt into a writhing mass of tentacle-like
limbs as his head tips back to emit a wide band of LEVIATHAN's
black light at the ceiling, accompanied by, renewed inhuman
laughter.

Taking this as their cue, the GIRLS turn and bolt for the doors
at the far and of the ward and exit through them.

The limbs extrude from MALAHIDE's palms only twelve inches or so
and are all quite thin, but they all have independent movement
and they all have various surgical-like, gleaming tips. MALAHIDE
floats over to the nearest bed. He looks at the patient and then
looks at the bladed tips of his new limbs and, as if addressing
them, speaks.

                               MALAHIDE
                  I recommend amputation.

There is another burst of laughter as the limbs fly at the
patient, writhing, twitching, slashing, and slicing.


114   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR  DAY

The GIRLS run wildly along the corridor, not knowing MALAHIDE is
working his way through his former patients. They come to another
door and pause. They look back down the corridor to ensure they
are not visible as they hide and KIRSTY pushes the door open with
the flat of her hand behind her. Carefully, still looking down
the corridor, they back into the room and let the door close.


115   INT.   HOSPITAL/TORTURE ROOM  DAY

CLOSE UP on the GIRLS' faces as the door closes in front of them.
KIRSTY lets out a breath. Then they hear the rattling sound behind
them. They swing round and the camera pulls out to take in the room.

It is like the TORTURE ROOM in HELLRAISER. The walls are black,
the floor slimy, and the room filled with chains, hooks, and
torture-pillars. And, in the room and staring at the GIRLS, are
the four CENOBITES.

PINHEAD glances theatrically around the room, as if checking
something.

                            PINHEAD
                  Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.

                            FEMALE CENOBITE
                  No more delays, Kirsty. No more
                  teasing. Time to play.

                            PINHEAD
                  Time to play.

KIRSTY looks at his unforgiving face and then her eyes suddenly
widen as she thinks Of something.

                            KIRSTY
                  Wait!

                            PINHEAD
                  No more deals, Kirsty. It's
                  your flesh we want to experience,
                  not your skill at bargaining.

                            KIRSTY
                  No deals! Just information.
                  Information. Free of charge.
                  No strings. Just information.

                            PINHEAD
                  Go on. But trick us again,
                  child, and your suffering will
                  be legendary even in Hell.

Carefully, making no fast movements, KIRSTY reaches into her
pocket where she placed the photograph from MALAHIDE's OBSESSION
ROOM. She brings out the picture that she realized earlier was
of PINHEAD and hands it to him.

He takes hold of it and looks, his face registering nothing.

                            PINHEAD
                  What is this? Someone else
                  you think escaped us, like
                  Frank?

                            KIRSTY
                  No, No, this one didn't escape.
                  You told me you'd always been
                  in Hell. You were wrong. Look
                  at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.

                            PINHEAD
                  Nonsense, I...

                            KIRSTY
                  It's you! You HAVEN'T always
                  been as you are. You were
                  HUMAN. Remember. Remember
                  all your confusions. Think!

The FEMALE CENOBITE strides across the room.

                            FEMALE CENOBITE
                  Enough!

She raises her hand towards KIRSTY. PINHEAD's arm flies out and
stops her.

                            PINHEAD
                  Wait!

He is staring at the photograph, that great immobile brow finally
puckering, as if something is stirring.

                            PINHEAD
                  I...remember.

                            KIRSTY
                  You were ALL human!

The other three CENOBITES stop moving and stare at KIRSTY. Any
advances they were making on KIRSTY or TIFFANY stop as the same
dim, distant, recollection begins to stir within them.

Suddenly, the door bursts open. MALAHIDE is there, still
floating, his voice still a mixture of hideous threat and
insane joy.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Tiffany. Come.

He turns his palms downwards, mirroring his gesture in the hall
of mirrors.

TIFFANY lets out a moan of terror and shakes her head.

One of the snake-like limbs from MALAHIDE's palms flies towards
TIFFANY's face. Before anybody can react, its scalpel tip has
sliced an inch or so off several strands of her hair.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Tiffany. Come.

KIRSTY throws her arms around the cowering TIFFANY and snarls at
her tormentor.

                            KIRSTY
                  Leave her alone, you asshole!

MALAHIDE makes no reply, but suddenly several more limbs fly
towards the GIRLS and begin to weave in front of KIRSTY's face
like snakes awaiting their moment.

At this stage, the camera CUTS TO the watching PINHEAD. He lets
the photograph of his past life flutter to the floor.

MALAHIDE looks up at the tiny noise this makes and his eyes meet
PINHEAD'S. He turns more fully to face PINHEAD and the other
CENOBITES who are now standing with their leader, and a strange
smile crosses his face

                            MALAHIDE
                  Oh,good. A fight.

Suddenly, the air is full of flying chains. MALAHIDE is hooked
everywhere. It is like a high-speed version of FRANK's final re-
capture in HELLRAISER. The chains start tugging almost instantly.

Is MALAHIDE about to be ripped apart?

With contemptuous, dismissive speed, the limbs that ooze from
MALAHIDE's palms have sliced the chains to pieces and, almost
before we have time to realise that, three of them have
lengthened, thickened, and hardened and have skewered the FEMALE
CENOBITE, CHATTERER II, and BUTTERBALL to the walls.

The three limbs detatch themselves from MALAHIDE. The three
CENOBITES are all well above the floor, pinned and twitching like
the rats in FRANK's attic.

As they die, they suddenly revert; there are three human corpses
on the walls of the room. A woman, a fat man, and a little boy.

MALAHIDE smiles. Be looks at PINHEAD again and advances. Suddenly
a heavy torture pillar smashes into him, knocking him slightly
off-balance.

PINHEAD is backing across the room, weaving pillars in front of
him as he moves. MALAHIDE moves forward, knocking them out of the
way. As each pillar is knocked aside, PINHEAD's face is more and
more human. Finally, when the face we see is nearly that of the
ENGLISH OFFICER from the opening, he turns his head slightly away
from the advancing MALAHIDE and finds KIRSTY's eyes. A look
passes between them. Understanding? Gratitude? Friendship?

Whatever emotion lies beneath it, it is clearly a cue and
KIRSTY and TIFFANY make a break for it, bursting through the
door. Simultaneously to this, MALAHIDE and PINHEAD find each
other's eyes a final time. For a second, everything is still then
a single bladed limb flies across the space between them and
neatly and calmly slices PINHEAD's throat open. The thin red line
becomes a torrent of blood and the former lord of Hell falls dead
at the feet of his successor.   


116   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   DAY

KIRSTY and TIFFANY burst out into the corridor and almost fall
over the PATIENT IN THE WHEELCHAIR.

                            PATIENT
                  So what, girls? It's O.K.
                  for an ego-trip but it
                  doesn't got the job done.

Shaking their heads at the insanity, they run up the corridor.

TIFFANY looks slightly distracted and when she speaks it is half
to herself.

                            TIFFANY
                  I have to go back. Or it'll
                  never stop.

                            KIRSTY
                         (Confused)
                  What are you talking...

                            TIFFANY
                          (to herself)
                  I've got to finish it.

                            KIRSTY
                  Finish what?

Even as KIRSTY says this, TIFFANY has moved past her and is
resuming her run down the corridor.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany! Wait!

KIRSTY starts after her friend.

They turn back into the main section of the corridor that contains
their own rooms, TIFFANY still four or five yards in front of
KIRSTY.

TIFFANY reaches her room. The door is open. She goes in. A second
later, KIRSTY follows.


117      INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM   DAY

KIRSTY enters the room. It is as we last saw it except that
the walls have re-parted to give onto the corridors of Hell.

Carefully and slowly, KIRSTY moves across to the entrance and
looks down it. She is rewarded with the sight of TIFFANY just
disappearing at the far end of the first corridor. With a
grimace, KIRSTY follows her in.


118   INT.   CORRIDOR/LABYRINTH

TIFFANY's skill at finding her way through puzzles means the
GIRLS are soon in the murkier corridors close to the Centre.

Hell seems angrier now, steam is issuing in jets from the
corridor walls, the cries of children are heard faintly on the
soundtrack, LEVIATHAN's breathing is more dominant, perhaps the
light is even pulsing in time with it.

KIRSTY is still several yards behind TIFFANY. TIFFANY takes a
corner and is out of sight for a second or so . KIRSTY dashes
around the corner to find TIFFANY staring with distress at
something on the floor.

It is the skin ripped off JULIA by the vacuum tunnel earlier.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, gross.

TIFFANY bends down and retrieves the white diamond BOX from the
empty fingers.

                            KIRSTY
                  What are you doing? What are WE doing?

TIFFANY looks at the BOX in her hand. When she speaks, it is not
to KIRSTY but to herself.

                            TIFFANY
                  I can't do it here. I have to
                  go to it.


119   INT.   THE CENTRE OF HELL

LEVIATHAN spins and fires light in the centre, his machine-like
breathing drowning all other sound. We are looking down the
catwalk as KIRSTY and TIFFANY approach its edge.

The beams of black light wash across their faces, as they passed
over MALAHIDE's in the earlier scene. Images of horror freeze
momentarily before them and then pass on, only to be replaced by
others.

                            TIFFANY
                  I'm scared.

                            KIRSTY
                  No. Don't let it. You've
                  come this far.

The GIRLS press on. Whether LEVIATHAN is oblivious to their
presence or simply doesn't consider them a threat, the beams stop
striking the GIRLS' faces. Nevertheless, the mood remains
ominous. The audience should feel something is about to happen.

They are six feet from the lip of the catwalk. TIFFANY kneels
and, holding the white diamond BOX in front of her, begins to
move her fingers over it. The music box tune begins to play as
the BOX begins to move.

That 'something' that the audience was waiting to happen,
suddenly does; MALAHIDE flies up from the abyss beside the
catwalk. The vastness of the limb that seals him to LEVIATHAN is
now directly apparent; instead of merging into black light, the
limb itself trails through the air over the huge distance to
LEVIATHAN itself.

One of the limbs from MALAHIDE's palms flies out and knocks the
BOX from TIFFANY's hands. It rolls perilously close to the edge
of the catwalk.

KIRSTY grabs TIFFANY and, dragging her to her feet, pulls her
further back down the catwalk as MALAHIDE floats to a landing
between them and the BOX.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Ah, girls. And how are we
                  feeling today?

The blades on the end of his limbs twitch eagerly.

                            MALAHIDE
                  You have your whole lives
                  behind you now.

The limbs fly forward. KIRSTY screams and both girls run up
the catwalk.

About halfway back up, however, TIFFANY stops, turns around, and
begins to walk back. KIRSTY calls out.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany! No!

The camera stays with TIFFANY as she makes her way back. KIRSTY's
voice stays on the soundtrack for a time, imploring her friend to
turn back and then simply stops. This should be abrupt enough to
make the audience notice but smooth enough to avoid their
attention leaving TIFFANY.

MALAHIDE waits, happy to see a patient so keen on the knife.

Very slowly, TIFFANY moves forward, inch by slow inch. This is
something she HAS to do; the expression on her face is not
determination but terror. And MALAHIDE is very happy to encourage
this.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Surgery is open, Tiffany.
                  What was today's agenda?

His scalpels flick in the air, making small slicing motions.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Ah, yes. Evisceration.

Still TIFFANY comes forward, closer and closer until she is
surely close enough to be grabbed.

Suddenly, she is grabbed. But from behind, and by a human hand.
TIFFANY gasps, and turns to see who has seized her. She screams.
It is JULIA.

The limbs retract into MALAHIDE's palms. He smiles.

                            JULIA
                  Doctor. I've missed you.

JULIA, having presumably just replaced her skin, is not quite as
perfect as before; there are bloody lines like scars beneath her
ears and chin as if the skin required some adjustment before
being put on.

JULIA moves forward, her left arm still holding TIFFANY, her
smile returning MALAHIDE'S.

                            MALAHIDE
                  I knew you'd come back.

                            JULIA
                  I'm a girl who keeps her promises.

JULIA is right next to MALAHIDE now. Smoothly, she releases her
grip on TIFFANY and embraces MALAHIDE sensuously. He returns the
embrace. They kiss.

Unseen, TIFFANY moves to the edge of the catwalk and picks up the
BOX. Her fingers move over it, finding its solution. Suddenly,
LEVIATHAN's breath becomes a roar of anger and fear.

MALAHIDE breaks away from his kiss, his face a mixture of
confusion and rage. JULIA plants both hands in the middle of his
chest and pushes. He falls over the lip of the catwalk but,
almost before he drops from sight, he is suddenly pulled
backwards through the air, screaming, as LEVIATHAN's limb
retracts. JULIA jumps back. shouting.

                            JULIA
                  Do it, Tiffany! Do it!

TIFFANY's fingers fly over the BOX and suddenly we see what is
happening. The mountain-like LEVIATHAN is following the movements
of the small replica in TIFFANY's hands. As TIFFANY inverts the
new configuration back towards a closed BOX, LEVIATHAN too is
being twisted and turned. Being closed.

The whole centre of Hell shakes as if suffering a mild
earthquake. JULIA and TIFFANY almost lose their footing, but
TIFFANY continues working. She is nearly, there. LEVIATHAN is
halfway between its white diamond, majesty and a huge closed BOX.

TIFFANY takes her hands from the BOX. It is done. The larger BOX
operates a few seconds behind it's control, so that we can inter-
cut the final sliding and creaking into position with the
following human drama;

As LEVIATHAN makes its final closing, the mild tremors of before
become larger. Hell shakes violently and this time TIFFANY does
lose her footing. She looks set to tumble into the vast abyss to
the side of the catwalk but just manages to catch hold of the edge
with one hand. The small BOX flies from her hand and hurtles down
into the miles of blackness below. TIFFANY dangles over the edge,
her feet kicking wildly for a foothold that doesn't exist.

Suddenly, a hand extends to her. She looks up. It is JULIA. For a
second, nothing happens.

                            JULIA
                  Trust me.

TIFFANY lifts one hand off the edge and grabs at JULIA's
proffered wrist.

JULIA begins to pull up and for a moment it seems the crisis is
over. Then a terrible and familiar ripping noise is heard: The
skin of the arm that TIFFANY clings to begins to rip free at the
shoulder. Gradually, like a shirt's threads unraveling, it
comes off. TIFFANY's weight pulls it clear like a very long and
very tasteless evening glove and it seems she will finally make
the long drop. At the final second, as the arm-skin comes off,
the entire skin flies from the body and falls with its arm into
the abyss. TIFFANY screams. She is going to die.

But suddenly the two arms that have Just lost their skin fly out
again and catch her fingers. TIFFANY is hauled over the edge and
staggers to her feet, staring into the-bloodied face of KIRSTY,
who had donned JULIA's skin to help her friend.

The two girls share a quick and joyous embrace and then run
rapidly up the catwalk. The camera stays with LEVIATHAN.

The rumbling stops. And the mountainous BOX creaks into its final,
sealed position.

FADE OUT

FADE IN


120   INT.  RECOVERY ROOM  DAY

CLOSE UP on a bowl of beautiful flowers, sitting on a shelf in
the recovery room.

The camera TRACKS out to let us see LARRY, pale, drawn, but
basically okay, in the room's single bad. He is wired up to
various drips and monitors.

Sunlight is flooding into the room from a window and the camera
continues its TRACK up to and through this window to;


121   EXT.   HOSPITAL MAIN ENTRANCE  DAY

KIRSTY is kissing TIFFANY on the cheek. TIFFANY is dressed in
smart clothes and has a small traveling bag in her hand.

                            KIRSTY
                  So. What're you going to do?
                  Open up a games-shop somewhere?
                  Sell jigsaw puzzles?

TIFFANY gives a smile.

                            TIFFANY
                  Oh, yeah.

There is a slightly awkward pause.

                            KIRSTY
                  Well ... G'bye.

                            TIFFANY
                  It's been Hell.

They share a rueful knowing smile, like the smile of soldiers
back from a war who say goodbye on a dockside and know they will
never meet again.

TIFFANY turns and walks down the long path to the hospital gates.
KIRSTY watches her for a few moments and then turns and re-enters
the institute.

The camera TRACKS back to the window of the RECOVERY ROOM and we
watch through the window as KIRSTY enters the room. She bends to
kiss her father's cheek. LARRY slips an arm around her shoulders
and they embrace. The camera moves away again.


122   INT.   HALLWAY  MALAHIDE's HOUSE  DAY

The camera TRACKS slowly up MALAHIDE's hallway. The hallway is
lined with packing cases filled with items from the house. A
WORKMAN is shoving something into one of the cases. As the camera
moves past him, he speaks.

                            WORKMAN
                  So whose was all this shit?

The camera reaches the doorway of the OBSESSION ROOM as an
answering voice is heard.

                            2nd. WORKMAN
                  Not our problem...

The TRACK continues into -


123   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM  DAY
                    
and we see the 2nd. WORKMAN. He is crouching over the mattress
which is still in the middle of the floor of the otherwise empty
room.

                            2nd. WORKMAN
                  ... Gimme a hand with this.

Almost faster than the eye can register it, a hand shoots out
from the mattress and grabs his wrist.

He has about half a second to issue a strangled shout and then,
hideously quickly, a matter of two seconds or so, his body is
drained of all life and the dried husk collapses to the floor.

The first WORKMAN appears hurriedly in the doorway and then
freezes, an awestruck expression on his face.

JULIA is rising, headfirst and upright, from the centre of the
mattress. The movement is smooth, magical, unsettling. It is
graceful but not slow.

JULIA is fully fleshed, fully skinned, and fully dressed. She is
in a replica of the dress MALAHIDE bought for her, but this one
is jet black. She looks fabulous.

As the WORKMAN stands open-mouthed, her feet clear the mattress.
But they don't stop there. She slows to a graceful halt about six
inches above the mattress. She stretches and flexes her arms
sensually. Than her head swivels and her excited, aroused eyes
meet those of the WORKMAN.

                            JULIA
                  I'm Julia. Love me.

Suddenly, her head tips back and, accompanied by JULIA's
delighted laughter, a wide beam of Hell's black light flies at
the ceiling from her open mouth. Instantaneously, it spills
across the ceiling and falls,like a fountain of blood, across the
screen.

COMPLETE BLACKNESS.


THE CREDITS ROLL
HELLRAISER II : HELLBOUND


                  Screenplay by Peter Atkins
                Original Story by Clive Barker


                                                 2nd. Draft
                                                 November 1, 1987


FADE IN:

1    TITLES

The screen is composed of large, straight-edge areas of black
and white that rest against each other in a manner that suggests
some kind of pattern, without making a final sense; it is as if
we are too close to something that, could we see it from a
distance, would be clear to us.

These areas shift and change - both their own shape and their
relationship to their neighbors.  New patterns are being made,
new solutions found - but they are just beyond our comprehension.
The effect should be aesthetically pleasing but simultaneously
frustrating and, perhaps, a little unsettling.

Shortly into this sequence, and subsequently inter-cut
throughout, we begin to see, in FLASHBACK, the story of
HELLRAISER.  Arriving first as very short shock-images, these
brief sections eventually convey to the audience all the
necessary emotional and narrative information they will need to
understand the background to HELLBOUND.

Meanwhile, the black and white shapes are still moving, the
unseen patterns still shifting.

Over this constantly mobile background, the TITLES begin to
appear.

As the TITLES unroll, another change comes over the puzzle pieces
behind them.  Where before they moved and related only in two
dimensions, gradually we see that they are now claiming depth as
well.  The puzzle we are looking at is now a three-dimensional
one.  The pieces are now solid blocks of various geometric
shapes, locking together, moving apart, finding their final
position.

Finally, as the TITLES come to their conclusion, the camera pulls
back until we can see clearly what we have been looking at.  As
the final piece clicks into positions we see it is THE LAMENT
CONFIGURATION from HELLRAISER.

The closed box rests before our eyes a moment and then the circle
in the centre of the side that faces us gives way to an image
of a dusty street with a market. Simultaneous to this, the camera
TRACKS into this image until it fills the screen


2    EXT   A STREET BAZAAR   DAY

The TRACK continues up through the market and then turns through
the stalls to find a store behind them. As we TRACK through the
store's doorway, we pass through a beaded curtain that
momentarily reminds us of the TORTURE ROOM in HELLRAISER.


3   INT.   STORE   DAY

Once we are in the store itself, though, this impression disappears.
It is an ordinary, slightly seedy, junk shop.

The stall seems to sell an odd mixture of items; native trinkets
share space with second-hand items from European colonists. These
second-hand goods give us some sense of period. They suggest the
late 'twenties/early 'thirties. This is reinforced by the
sounds coming from one of them, an old-fashioned mahogany-cased
wireless. A foreign voice speaks from it in a language we don't
understand, though perhaps the words "BBC world service" are
discerned in the middle, and then a dance-hall tune of the period
begins to play. (Depending on availability, it would be nice to
have something relevant - 'I'll follow my Secret Heart', perhaps,
or 'Dancing in the Dark'.)

Into shot comes an ENGLISH OFFICER. His uniform, too, suggests
the 'twenties, the last days of Empire. He is tall, thin, and
dark-haired, but at no stage do we see his face clearly. He
stands in front of the stall.

The TRADER suddenly stands behind the counter. He has been
crouched beneath it, as if checking or preparing something. He
is a big, impressive-looking black man. His face is totally
impassive as he stares at his customer.

Neither of the men speak. Obviously, a deal has already been
struck and today is the pay-off.

The OFFICER, a little arrogantly - suggesting racist contempt,
slaps down a bag of gold on the stall's counter.

Keeping his eyes firmly on the OFFICER, he reaches beneath him
and brings something up from under the counter and places it In
the OFFICER'S outstretched hand. He is holding a LAMENT
CONFIGURATION.

The OFFICER turns and leaves. The camera TRACKS out of the store,
looking at the TRADER as he watches the departing OFFICER.


4    INT   THE OFFICER'S QUANSETT HUT   DAY

It is typical of temporary military quarters, complete with a
curved ceiling of corrugated material. It is stripped of furniture.
The blinds are down.

The OFFICER, still in uniform, sits cross-legged, the BOX held
before him.

He is already well into the solving process and very soon after
the shot begins the BOX begins to speed its own solution.

Finally, two sections of the BOX shoot upwards and begin to peel
apart from each other, ready to reveal its secret.

The OFFICER, suddenly nervous, drops the BOX and scuttles back
across the floor to stare at it. The BOX lands upright, its
extended parts still open above it. For a beat of two, nothing
happens. We become aware of the OFFICER'S pulse, throbbing
excitedly on the soundtrack.


5    INT   THE OFFICER'S QUANSETT HUT   DAY    OFFICER'S P.O.V.

Slowly we, the camera, and the OFFICER, move towards the still,
silent, but menacing BOX.

We approach it until finally we are above it, looking down into
the opening it has made in itself. There is undefined movement
inside.

Suddenly, something flies up directly at us. We glimpse it only
briefly, but enough to see its nature. Unlike the hooks that
flaw at FRANK in HELLRAISER, this is more organic than metallic.
Pink and flesh-like but on a long gray-blue stalk, it
flies upward, its lips peeling apart gapingly to reveal scores of
yellow, discoloured, and viciously sharp teeth-like hooks.

The OFFICER screams and the screen begins to take on a red tint
so that, just as the thing is about to fill the screen
with its hungry mouth, the entire screen turns red.

The red screen is held for a second and then suddenly becomes
complete blackness.


6    INT   BLACK SPACE

The black screen continues and, rising slowly from it and falling
back slowly into it, in a dream-like, surrealistic manner, come
various images of the OFFICER'S torment/pleasure in Hell.

By various camera tricks, such as step-printing or optical
blurring, his face is still not clearly seen, but is seen enough
for us to see his sensual, almost orgasmic responses to what is
being done to him.

Cuts appear spontaneously across his face, leaving a grid like
crisscross pattern of wounds.

Finally, a disembodied hand gripping a hammer drives nails into
each corner formed by these wounds and, as the face comes into
full view for the first time, we realize who this is. It is
PINHEAD from HELLRAISER.

PINHEAD'S completed face floats on the blackness and stares out
at us.

                            PINHEAD
                        (echoed & slow)
                  Kirsty, come to daddy

The tiny silence following PINHEAD's words is shattered by a
piercing and terrified scream.


7    INT   HOSPITAL ROOM    NIGHT

The scream continues, but the blackness is replaced by KIRSTY's
anguished face; it is she who is screaming. The scream subsides,
replaced by breathless panting accompanied by rapid eye movement.

                            RONSON
                         (off camera)
                  Ah, you're awake. Good.

We pull out to see that KIRSTY is sitting up, fully dressed, on a
hospital bed. RONSON, a police detective, sits on a plain wooden
chair, which is the only other piece of furniture in the room.
The walls are bare save for a piece of primitive art on one wall,
and, on another, a circular barred window looking out.

RONSON stands up and walks to the foot of the bed. He rests his
hand on the bed's metal frame and smiles a perfunctory smile.

                            RONSON
                  Tell you what - we'll make a
                  deal. I'll tell you what I
                  know, then you tell me what
                  you know.  O.K.?

KIRSTY is still re-orienting herself. She blinks a few times
and then focuses on RONSON's hands gripping the bed.

                            RONSON
                  O.K.?

KIRSTY looks up at RONSON's face and then around at the room.

                            KIRSTY
                  Where am I?

                            RONSON
                  You're in the Malahide Institute.
                  It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey,
                  don't feel judged - it was just
                  the nearest place to bring you.
                  Remember? You and your boyfriend... ?

                            KIRSTY
                  Steve...

                            RONSON
                  Don't worry. He's O.K.  We sent him
                  home hours ago.  Jeez, what a story.

He puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it.

                            RONSON
                  What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust?
                  Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?

                            KIRSTY
                  What are you talking about?  Who
                  are you?

                            RONSON
                  Oh, excuse me...

RONSON reaches in his jacket and flashes an I.D.

                            RONSON
                  Ronson.  Homicide.  I'm this
                  district's slash and dash expert.
                  Made a career of the nasty ones.
                  That's why I was at your
                  Dad's house.  Jesus, what a mess.

KIRSTY'S eyes prick with tears. She looks away from RONSON.

                            KIRSTY (to herself)
                  Daddy...


8    INT   JUNK ROOM LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT

CORTEZ, a POLICE OFFICER, shifts some unpacked crates to
allow a closer look at the shriveled and deformed corpse of one
of FRANK and JULIA'S victims.

                            CORTEZ
                  Jesus...

CORTEZ prods at the corpse with his night-stick, attempting
to turn it over. A stream of maggots pours from the mouth and
the cavity that used to be its throat.

CORTEZ jumps back in disgust and knocks against one of the
several wardrobes in the cluttered room.  Another corpse flies
out at him, as decayed and flvblown as the first.

CORTEZ draws his gun and empties it blowing the corpses
head off, scattering flesh, mucus, and bone - but no blood -
everywhere before realizing it is already dead.

He realises what he has done and lowers his weapon sheepishly.

                            CORTEZ
                  Oh. shit...


9   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   DAY

RONSON is sitting back in the chair, looking at the now slightly
calmer KIRSTY.

                            RONSON
                  We got two missing people
                  and a house full of corpses.

He holds out his hand towards KIRSTY in a theatrical manner.

                            RONSON
                  Talk to me.

KIRSTY swings her legs off the bad, but remains sitting on it,
her feet on the floor. She doesn't look directly at RONSON but
begins to take in the (few) details of the room for the first
time.

                            KIRSTY
                  I thought Steve had talked
                  to you?

                            RONSON
                  Oh, pardon me. I obviously didn't
                  convey my hesitation to take his
                  story at face-value. No, YOU
                  talk to me. But - do me a favor? -
                  none of this DEMONS crap.

KIRSTY closes her eyes, almost wincing, as memory comes.

KIRSTY opens her eyes. Consciously, she slows the rhythm of the
dialogue down.

                            KIRSTY
                  He talked about Demons, huh?

                            RONSON
                  Yeah.

KIRSTY turns her head to look directly at RONSON.

                            KIRSTY
                  It's true. All of it. It's all true.

RONSON stares at her, impressed by her conviction and intensity.
There is a second of shared silence.

Suddenly, a shocking ELECTRONIC CRACKLE shatters the mood. RONSON
starts, then realises it is the radio at his belt. He snatches it
up and speaks into it.

                            RONSON
                  Ronson.

10    INT   BEDROOM  LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT

Another OFFICER, KUCICH, is standing, radio in hand, by the
blood-stained mattress. CORTEZ stands beside him, gun now safely
re-holstered.

                            KUCICH
                  Kucich here,sir.  We just found another one,
                  though it suffered a little...

KUCICH looks at CORTEZ, who looks embarrassed.

                            KUCICH
                  ...er, accidental damage in discovery.
                  Anyway, just about the only portable
                  evidence we've got here - apart from
                  human remains - is the mattress. Looks
                  like someone was messed up real bad
                  on it.


11    INT   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

                            KUCICH
                         (off-camera)
                  Can we send it downtown?

RONSON throws KIRSTY a look of exasperation with his colleague.
The camera stays on KIRSTY's face as RONSON speaks.

                            RONSON
                  What the hell are you asking me
                  for?  Tag it.  Move it.

                            KIRSTY (to herself)
                  The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.

Without waiting for a reply, RONSON switches the radio off and
clips it back to his belt.


12    INT   BEDROOM   55 STREET   NIGHT
We are looking at the mattress. KUCICH has left the room.

CORTEZ draws a pad from his packet. The pad is stapled, and
the staple has been badly inserted and is not closed property.
In the act of tearing a label from the pad, CORTEZ catches
his thumb on the staple.

                            OFFICER
                  Shit!

The label is adhesive-backed. CORTEZ licks it and presses
it on the mattress. He writes on it - 55L/E1.  As he stands up
from doing this, a single drop of blood from his thumb lands on
the mattress. (It is important that we see it is only a single
drop - and nothing like the amount LARRY spilled on the
floorboards.)

CORTEZ leaves the room to fetch a colleague to help him
move the mattress.  We move in to see the drop of blood disappear
very quickly into the mattress, as if it is being sucked in.

As this happens, we hear on the soundtrack the faintest RUMBLE.


13    INT   OPERATING ROOM   NIGHT

A somewhat antiquated and frightening operating room, filled
with machines, monitors, and surgical instruments. The corners of
the room fall away to shadow.

Sitting upright in the centre of the room is a FEMALE PATIENT.
She is awake and staring out at the camera.  Twin probes/clamps
are in each of her ears to hold her in place.  Her head is shaved
and the skin on the back of her head has been cut open and peeled
apart.  The flaps of the skin are held away from the area being
worked on by four clamps. (we never actually see round to the
exposed brain itself)

Immediately behind her, and probing with professional skill and
coolness into her exposed brain, is DOCTOR MALAHIDE.  He is in
his late forties and looks like all the great doctors look -
rational, civilized, competent, and powerful.  There is an
intensity in his eyes and the lines  of his face though that
suggests something more than normal.

The room has several attentive listeners and observers, but the
one nearest to MALAHIDE is his personal student/assistant KYLE
MACRAE, young, conventionally good-looking, with an open,
friendly, face.

MALAHIDE is holding forth on the secrets of his trade, several times
looking away from his patient while still working on her, to make
sure his audience understand his points.

                            MALAHIDE
                  We can bring them back properly
                  more often than scientific orthodoxy
                  dictates, ladies and gentlemen.  And
                  the knife, far from the enemy of
                  of analysis, is often its greatest
                  ally in solving the puzzles of
                  psychosis. Analysis isolates and
                  massages. Surgery pinpoints and
                  corrects. ... though you've got to
                  know what you're doing, of course...

Polite laughter from several students.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Some things are obvious. Here,
                  for example, ...

He prods in at a specific area.

                            MALAHIDE
                  ...are the optical motor nerve
                  control centers.

The PATIENT begins to blink in time with MALAHIDE'S prodding.
The affect is half-comical, half-distressing.  Perhaps MALAHIDE
carries it on just that half-second too long for innocent
demonstration.  But the students give impressed murmurs anyway.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Now. This case. A deeply-buried
                  psychosis severe enough to produce
                  frighteningly frequent hysteria and
                  aggression. Incurable. Say others. Not so.
                  Analysis isolates. The knife
                  exposes. Medication controls.

As he speaks, MALAHIDE injects a syringe directly into the
PATIENT's brain. Her face spasms momentarily.

MALAHIDE stands back slightly. His face is serene, calm, and
confident.

He takes a small, motorised drill and sets to work on the brain.

                            MALAHIDE
                  And then, ladies and gentlemen, we
                  REBUILD. With all the care and
                  knowledge that our years of training
                  have given us ...

He looks around at them all, smiling slightly.

                            MALAHIDE

                  ... WE BRING THEM BACK.

The students murmur their approval. Perhaps they even applaud.
MALAHIDE acknowledges their reaction with a modest nod.

Suddenly, an intercom on the wall cuts in.

                            INTERCOM
                  Dr. Malahide, the new arrival is
                  awake, and appears very distressed.

MALAHIDE steps back briskly and begins to peel his cloves off.
He nods at a nearby student.

                            MALAHIDE
                  My part in this is over.  You
                  may tidy up for me.  Kyle, you
                  come with me.

MALAHIDE and KYLE leave the room.


14    INT   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

KIRSTY has her hands over her face and is shaking.  RONSON stands
and crosses to her.  He takes her hand from her face and calms
her.

                            RONSON
                  Easy, easy.  Whatever happened,
                  whatever you saw, it's not here
                  now.

                            KIRSTY
                  I saw it...him.  But I got away.
                  And I took the box.  And I solved
                  it.  And they came.

                            RONSON
                  Who?

                            KIRSTY
                  The Cenobites.

She stares directly at RONSON, daring him to disbelieve.

                            KIRSTY
                  The Demons.

RONSON stares back, perhaps a glimmer of belief in his eyes.

On the soundtrack, the sudden and shocking sound of a door being
slammed open and hitting the wall.

KIRSTY screams. Even RONSON is startled.

In the doorway are DOCTOR MALAHIDE and KYLE.  MALAHIDE advances
into the room, smiling apologetically as he does so.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Sorry.  Must get that door
                  fixed.  Detective Ronson?

MALAHIDE holds his hand out, as RONSON nods in response.

                            MALAHIDE
                  I am Doctor Malahide.

The man shake hands. MALAHIDE gestures behind him.

                            MALAHIDE
                  My assistant, Kyle Macrae.  And
                  this must be Kirsty?

MALAHIDE speaks quickly, as if to get the formalities out of the
way.  As he says her name, he smiles benignly at KIRSTY who,
still distraught from her memories and shocked at the slamming of
the door, simply stares at him.

MALAHIDE turns his attention back to RONSON, drawing him away and
speaking to him in a lower voice.

Meanwhile, KYLE walks over to KIRSTY and smiles at her - long
enough to embarrass her into smiling back.

                            MALAHIDE
                  I've read the boy's statement.
                  Quite the adventure they
                  believe they had. I'd like to talk
                  to her alone. Do you think ... ?

RONSON looks over his shoulder at KIRSTY.  He then looks
carefully at MALAHIDE and then nods slowly.

                            RONSON
                  Mmmm.  O.K.  Frankly, I think
                  she's more your territory than
                  mine.  Shame.

RONSON looks back at KIRSTY.

                            RONSON
                  Kirsty.  Doctor Malahide's going
                  to look after you now.  Maybe we
                  could talk some more tomorrow.

KIRSTY nods vaguely and then, just as RONSON reaches the door,
calls out to him.

                            KIRSTY
                  Wait!  The mattress.  You've got
                  to destroy it.  She DIED on it,
                  you see.  The mattress.  It's
                  haunted now.  She can come back...
                  like Frank. SHE CAN COME BACK.

RONSON smiles helplessly at her, then glances at MALAHIDE with a
 "you see what I mean" expression, and leaves the room.

                            KIRSTY (to herself)
                  The mattress ...

MALAHIDE stares at her briefly, with a strange expression on his
face and then abruptly follows RONSON through the door.

KIRSTY is too absorbed to notice this odd behavior, but KYLE
stares incredulously as MALAHIDE leaves the room.

                            KYLE
                  Uh...excuse me a moment.

He follows to the door and stands in the doorway, looking down
the corridor.


15    INT   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR    NIGHT

RONSON stands before a set of double-doors, talking to a
UNIFORMED OFFICER.

MALAHIDE comes into view, walking swiftly, and instantly talks
over their conversation.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Detective. I'll be able to help
                  this girl. But I need your assistance ...


16    INT   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT

Looking back at the corridor, we see the door to KIRSTY'S room
ajar, and KYLE standing by it looking down.


17    INT   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT  (KYLE' P.O.V)

A LONG SHOT of MALAHIDE and RONSON.  KYLE, and we, are too far
away to hear what is said, but MALAHIDE in nodding and gesturing
emphatically, as if persuading RONSON of something.


18   INT   HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT

KYLE returns into the room and closes the door. His expression is
puzzled, troubled. Then he remembers there is a patient here and
he smiles.
                            KYLE
                  So...You're Kirsty, huh?


                            KIRSTY
                  You a doctor, too?

KYLE smiles again.

                            KYLE
                  Nearly a doctor. I'm Kyle
                  Macrae. Call me Kyle.

KIRSTY draws a deep breath, temporarily calmed. She even manages
a smile.

                            KIRSTY
                  Hi, Kyle.

MALAHIDE re-enters the room.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Now, Kirsty...

KIRSTY looks at him warily.

                            KIRSTY
                  The cop. He didn't believe me.

                            MALAHIDE
                  I suspect not. But that
                  doesn't necessarily mean
                  you're wrong, does it?

                            KIRSTY
                  Do you believe me?

MALAHIDE offers a re-assuring laugh.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Well, I don't know yet.
                  However, you're not lying.
                  YOU believe this is the truth.

                            KIRSTY
                  It IS the truth.

Suddenly, the door opens again. An INTERN is standing there. For
the briefest of moments, MALAHIDE looks furious and then,
catching himself, assumes his calm demeanor.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Well?

                            INTERN
                  Sorry, Dr. Malahide. But it's
                  Tiffany. She's escaped ... again.

MALAHIDE sighs.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Very Well.

He looks down at KIRSTY.

                            KIRSTY
                  I'm sorry, Kirsty. Kyle will
                  come back with something to
                  help you sleep. We shall speak
                  tomorrow.

MALAHIDE and KYLE follow the intern from the room, KYLE giving a
last friendly smile as the door closes behind them.


19   EXT.   CARNIVAL   NIGHT

We are staring down the midway of a deserted carnival. On either
side, stalls and rides beckon to pleasures that their locked
doors and tarpaulin-draped entrances deny. A light rain is
falling.

A huge wooden cut-out of a grinning clown dominates one stall
while the sign beneath him seems to state the ethos of the whole
place; LOTS 'O' FUN.

Another has a banner proclaiming FREAK SHOW, with the subheading
YOU'LL GASP AT THE GEEK!

On the horizon in the distance, almost denying the reality of
what we are seeing, tower vast cranes of unimaginable height
while beyond them impossibly huge oil-drums squat against the
moon-bright but cloudy sky.

Into shot, and running down the midway, comes a girl, TIFFANY.

TIFFANY is a girl in her early teens but looks younger
then her years due to her boyish figure and her slightly over-
delicate features.

For the last months, TIFFANY has been finding ways out of the
institute and making her way here, where she has one special
obsession, which we will soon see.

Following her into shot, but many yards behind, come two INTERNS
from the Institute. They contrast each other almost comically,
one being tall and plump while the other is smaller and thinner.
They're not quite the Stan and Ollie of the medical world but
with some serious rehearsal they could get there.

                            1st INTERN
                  Oh, Jesus -she's gonna make it.

Even as the first INTERN says this, we see TIFFANY make a sharp
left turn into a stall entrance.


20   EXT.   HALL OF MIRRORS   ENTRANCE   NIGHT

A front view of the stall into which TIFFANY has run. The large
sign above it proclaims 'HALL OF MIRRORS' and a smaller sign
perched above a distorting mirror to one side of the entrance
says 'YOU'LL BE AMAZED'.

The two INTERNS enter at a run.


21   INT.   HALL OF MIRRORS    NIGHT

There follows a hopelessly one-sided pursuit through the
mirror maze as TIFFANY effortlessly eludes the two INTERNS.

There are three major facets to this sequence;
1) Comic relief - as the two interns make fools of themselves.
There could even be a room of distorting mirrors where the thin
INTERN becomes fat and the fat one thin.
2) TIFFANY'S ease and expertise with patterns and puzzles.
3) Confusion of the audience's sense of the real and the unreal.

This goes on long enough for us to realise the 1ST INTERN was
right to worry, how long TIFFANY could elude them. Then,
jarringly, as the screen is full of reflected TIFFANYS
there suddenly appears amongst them a single image of
MALAHIDE.

Everything stops.

The image of MALAHIDE (and we shouldn't he sure yet if we're
looking at a reflection or the real man) puts its hands out,
palms up.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Tiffany. Come.

All the TIFFANYS move quietly toward him until they all disappear
from view. Then the real TIFFANY comes into shot, her back to us,
and walks toward what we now see to be the real MALAHIDE, who is
standing in a doorway deliberately framed like a mirror to
confuse the customers.

TIFFANY places her hands docilely on to MALAHIDE's outstretched
ones.


22   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

KIRSTY has been dozing fitfully, but is awakened by strange
noises. At first terrified, she slowly realises it is simply
someone being put in the room next door.

She waits until activity has ceased and then moves to her door.
It is unlocked. She moves out into the corridor.


23   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT

Looking warily from side to side, KIRSTY edges out into the
corridor, along it, and then stops by the door of the adjoining
room.


24   INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM   NIGHT   C.U.

A hand fits a piece of jig-saw puzzle into the space it belongs.
We know it is a jig-saw by the shape of the pieces, but it is
clearly not the conventional type - a picturesque photo - because
all we can see at this close-up angle are large areas of black
and white.


25    INT. TIFFANY'S ROOM   NIGHT

We now see that the puzzle is on the floor of a room of a similar
size to KIRSTY'S. It is slightly more decorated; It has curtains
and wallpaper. And a tiled floor. Sitting cross-legged on the
floor next to the puzzle is TIFFANY.

The puzzle, which we can now see more clearly, is an intricate
abstract design in black and white. There are several pieces
still un-fitted but TIFFANY is working steadily, efficiently, and
with complete concentration.

On a wall behind her there is a visual record of her progress
over the last few months. Sealed in plastic by staff members are.
Puzzles she has solved, with dates marking her advancement. They
begin with the simplest wood block animals usually given to very
small children. passing through photo-puzzles of increasing
difficulty, and culminating in one or two other examples of the
kind of complicated pattern-work she is involved in now.


26   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT

We pull out to see that this is KIRSTY'S P.O.V. from the glass
panel in the door of TIFFANY'S room.

TIFFANY looks up at one point and eye-contact is made. KIRSTY
gives a tentative smile and a small wave. TIFFANY stares at her.
The stare is long but unresponsive and finally TIFFANY returns to
the puzzle.

KIRSTY has her back to us and the camera is quite close in when a
hand suddenly moves into shot and touches her shoulder.

KIRSTY jumps back in alarm, fear on her face. But it is only
KYLE.

KYLE raises his hand in apology.

                            KYLE
                  Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry. God, if
                  anyone should know not to do that,
                  it's me. I'm sorry. O.K.?

KIRSTY nods and gives a nervous smile. KYLE, still embarrassed by
his foolishness and eager to change the subject, nods towards the
glass panel.

                            KYLE
                  Sad, huh? She's been here
                  six months. Her name's TIFFANY.

                            KIRSTY
                  What's the matter with her?

                            KYLE
                  Almost complete withdrawal. She
                  hasn't said a word for nearly
                  two years.

                            KIRSTY
                  God, that's terrible.

                            KYLE
                  Yeah. Doctor Malahide's got her
                  doing these jig-saws and things,
                  though. Says it's helping to
                  bring her out.

KYLE ushers KIRSTY back into her own room.


27   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   DAY

As he closes the door to KIRSTY's room, KYLE reaches into the
pocket of his lab-coat and produces a small box of pills.

                            KYLE
                  Anyway, let's concentrate on
                  you for a moment. Wanna suck
                  on this for me?

KIRSTY looks up at him sharply. He is proffering a pill and
grinning facetiously.

                            KIRSTY
                  Hey, good joke, Kyle. Do you
                  always come on to the mentally
                  ill?

KYLE's face falls. He blushes. Pressing the pills into KIRSTY's
hand, he backs off to the door, apologising.

                            KYLE
                  Shit. Sorry. Here's the
                  pills. Red face. Door. Bye.

He exits hurriedly, closing the door behind him. KIRSTY grins
despite herself. She looks at the pill for a second or two and
then puts it firmly back in the box. Realising there is no
bedside table, she puts the box on the wooden chair.

                            KIRSTY
                  Jesus, I'm glad I'm not paying
                  for this place.

She is about to lie down on the bed, when she senses something is
wrong in the room.

KIRSTY is instantly tense again. She swings her head to the side
and tenses in horror, stifling a scream.

In the corner of the room, against the wall lying in a pool of
blood, is her skinned father LARRY.

KIRSTY emits a pained moan of pure anguish as she realises what
she is looking at.

                            KIRSTY
                    (under her breath)
                  Daddy...

The thing in the corner raises its arm weakly from its side and
begins to write on the wall in its own blood.

It writes : I AM IN HELL; HELP ME.

KIRSTY covers her eyes with her hands and begins to sob.

KIRSTY takes her hands from her eyes.

The figure has gone. The pool of blood has disappeared. But, on
the wall the words remain.

KIRSTY makes herself rise from the bed and walk slowly across the
room.

Her eyes full of tears, she stretches out her arm and touches the
word 'I'.

As her fingers make contact, the words instantly disappear.

She presses her bloodied finger quickly to her lips before that
last trace of her father can vanish, too.


28    INT.    TIFFANY'S ROOM  NIGHT

TIFFANY is still sitting up cross-legged, weeping. Her puzzle is
completed.


29    EXT.    THE INSTITUTE   DAY

Basically an establishing shot to show it is the next morning but
it also serves to show MALAHIDE walking briskly to work. His suit
is tasteful and simple, but discreetly expensive-looking. He
walks with purpose and looks straight ahead, acknowledging only
with polite nods the respectful greetings of various JUNIOR
DOCTORS and NURSES he passes on his way. He enters the institute.

We should also see several patients being walked, or wheeled,
around by STAFF during this shot.

                            MALAHIDE
                          (off-camera)
                  And how are we feeling today...?


30   INT.   LARGE WARD   DAY

This is a large, traditional hospital ward with a line of beds
down each long wall and a wide central aisle.

Nearly all of the beds are occupied and, at the far end of the
ward, there is a male patient in a wheelchair.

All the PATIENTS' eyes turn immediately and happily to MALAHIDE
as he crosses the room, continuing his speech.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Better? Good.

He-doesn't stop his progress but walks straight through the room
and into the corridor.

As the door closes behind him the WHEELCHAIR PATIENT scowls.

                            W/CHAIR PATIENT
                  105 years and he still doesn't
                  know my name.


31    INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   DAY

MALAHIDE walks swiftly down the corridor in which we saw him talk
to RONSON earlier, but this time the camera follows him through
the double doors and further down the corridor.

He enters an elevator and the doors close in front of him.


32   INT.  BASEMENT CORRIDOR   DAY

MALAHIDE exits the elevator into a lower corridor, one not so
carefully decorated.

We are in the area in which the more deeply disturbed of the
Institute's patients live.

The rooms are smaller, closer together, and there is an
observation panel set in each door.

MALAHIDE looks into the first four rooms.

In the first, a middle-aged, overweight woman sits completely
motionless in the middle of the floor. She is dressed in a
shapeless white robe and is sitting crosslegged. Her head is
shaven, her eyes are rolled completely up into the sockets so
that only white shows.

In the second, a very thin man of about thirty is pressed as
tight as he can be into one corner of the room. His hair is long
and he has a full beard. He is naked but not unadorned - his body
and much of his cell wall is smeared in excrement.

In the third, a man of about MALAHIDE'S age-stands in the centre
of the room. He is of normal build but his head is shaved. His
face, scalp, and hands are covered in self-inflicted and
amaterurish tattoos- all of crosses. He is dressed in T-shirt and
jeans. With both hands he holds aloft a silver crucifix, pointing
it in all directions, as if under constant siege by Devils. He
mutters prayers and invocations constantly.

In the fourth, a man in his early twenties restrained in a
strait-jacket. He shuffles around on the call-floor, his eyes
twitching and flitting from one part of his body to another.

                            BROWNING
                          (muttering)
                  Get them off me. Get them off me.

Off-camera, we hear the sound of KIRSTY's sobbing - which bridges
the CUT TO:


33 INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM DAY

KYLE enters, having heard KIRSTY crying. She is sitting with her
legs over the side of the bed with her face in her hands.

KYLE immediately sits next to her and puts an arm around her
shoulder. He doesn't force her to speak. He lets her let the
tears out. Finally, she looks up.

                            KIRSTY
                  I...I had a visitor.

                            KYLE
                  What?

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's
                  ...it's. I don't know how to
                  help! I have to save him and I
                  don't know how to help!

                            KYLE
                         (Carefully)
                  Kirsty, I'm sorry...  don't
                  understand. I...

                            KIRSTY
                  I know. No-one can. But I have to save
                  him. Where's the other doctor? He said
                  He'd listen. He promised.

KYLE responds quickly to this. His faith in MALAHIDE is
strong, despite that curious incident of the previous night when
MALAHIDE followed RONSON out of the room.

                            KYLE
                  Dr. Malahide. Yes. Look, I'll
                  fetch him. You take it easy.
                  I'm sure he can help.

KYLE stands up, making soothing motions with his hands, and heads
for the door.

                            KIRSTY
                  Help. No, no-one can help. I
                  just want someone to listen
                  or I WILL go crazy.

                            KYLE
                  If anyone can help, HE can.

KIRSTY turns and gives KYLE a strange look as he opens the door.

                            KIRSTY
                  Yeah? He got a ticket to Hell?


34    INT.    HOSPITAL CORRIDOR     DAY

We TRACK with KYLE down the corridor, eventually reaching an
impressive door, which is slightly ajar. Even before we reach it,
we hear MALAHIDE's voice. He is clearly on the phone. Because of
the nature of what he is hearing, KYLE pauses when he reaches the
door, listening with a confused expression on his face.

                            MALAHIDE
                   (off-camera & gradually fading up)
                  Officer Kucich? Yes, Doctor
                  Malahide. You've spoken to
                  Ronson? Yes ... That's right.
                  The mattress ... No, I'll meet
                  you by the side entrance. No, no,
                  my HOUSE. Yes, let me make that
                  clear. The house, NOT the hospital.
                  ... Yes ... Fine, and thank you.

We hear the phone click. KYLE waits a moment and then walks
swiftly through the door, speaking as he does so.

                            KYLE
                  Doctor Malahide ... ?


35   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM    DAY

KIRSTY'S face fills the screen. Her voice is slightly dreamy, as
if she is still trying to understand herself the story she is
about to tell.

                            KIRSTY
                  It must have been going on
                  forever...

Her voice trails off. We pull out to see KIRSTY sitting up on her
bed. MALAHIDE on the wooden chair, and KYLE standing by the
door.

MALAHIDE's voice pulls her back.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Kirsty...?

KIRSTY snaps back and continues to speak in a more normal voice.

                            KIRSTY
                  But the part I know about,
                  That must have started with
                  my Uncle Frank...

                            MALAHIDE
                  Then let us speak of it ...

DISSOLVE TO


36   EXT.   MALAHIDE's HOUSE  TWILIGHT

We TRACK in slowly towards a modern house that we will learn is
MALAHIDE'S, up the drive, towards the front door.

DISSOLVE TO


37  INT.  MALAHIDE'S HALLWAY  TWILIGHT

The TRACK continues along the hallway and into the OBSESSION
ROOM.


38   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   NIGHT

The TRACK continues.

The room is dim, lit only by stray shafts of moonlight.

On the floor in the centre of the room is the mattress.

The TRACK stops. A main light is clicked on and MALAHIDE moves
into shot.  MALAHIDE pours himself a scotch from the decanter that
sits on the writing table and approaches the mattress.

He is clearly very, excited. He walks around the mattress two or
three times, never taking his eyes off it.

He walks back to the writing table, throws his drink back, puts
the glass down and leaves the room.


39   EXT.   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

MALAHIDE leaves through his front door and walks toward the
hospital.


40    INT.   OBSESSION ROOM NIGHT

After a few seconds silence we hear a repeated clicking sound, as
if something is being forced, followed by a louder snap and the
sound of a sash window being opened.

The curtains balloon inwards, part, and KYLE steps into the room.

He stands still for a moment, as if making sure he is alone, and
then begins to take in his surroundings.

The room is entirely devoted to MALAHIDE'S secret obsession -
with the Paranormal in general and the Lament Configuration in
particular.

It is a fair-sized, square shaped room. Prints, paintings, and
photographs cover the walls. All of these pictures relate in some
way to his obsession; photographs of ghost-sightings; portraits
of magicians from Cagliostro to Crowley; prints of arcane symbols
and pentagrams, etc.

Specifically, we recognize a print that resembles very closely
the jigsaw he has had TIFFANY recently solve. Also, there are
framed diagrams (which look very old) of the Lament Configuration
-Both open and closed.

On a long, low table there are three glass cases. In each of
these cases is a Lament Configuration. On each case is a small
label giving a location, a date of acquisition, and a number -
which we may assume to be the number of deaths attributable to
that specific box.

These labels read:          CAIRO 3/4/'59 7
                            LYONS 6/2/'72 4
                            NEW YORK 12/3/'81 5

There are also, on a small desk-top bookshelf on a writing table,
editions of MALAHIDE'S own books. He seems to have spent his
career publicly denying what he is privately obsessed with -
because the books titles include 'Possession: Not Demons but
Disease','The Myth of the Diabolic', and 'The Internal Inferno'.

                            KYLE
                  Jesus Christ. Jee-sus-kerr-ist!

We assume he has visited MALAHIDE'S house before, but he has
clearly never seen this room.

He stares at the mattress with incredulity, as if he still can't
believe his superior has had it brought here. Then he begins to
look around the room in more detail. He approaches the glass
cases and bends slightly to look at their contents.

KYLE shakes his head.

                            KYLE
                  Oh, shit.


41   INT.   BASEMENT CORRIDOR NIGHT

MALAHIDE walks past a bank of meters and huge circuit breakers on
his way to the lower and of the corridor, by the cells
of the very disturbed. He stops by the cell of the man in the
strait-jacket. We hear from the outside the familiar muttering of
BROWNING. MALAHIDE enters the call.


42   INT.   BROWNING'S CELL   NIGHT

As MALAHIDE enters, BROWNING looks at him. His eyes demand, not
plead, and he speaks through clenched teeth.

                            BROWNING
                  Get them off me. Get. Them.
                  Off. Me.


43   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   NIGHT

KYLE is rooting through the drawers in the writing table.

Generally the contents are unremarkable - handwritten notes, a
few patients case-files etc. - but in one of the drawers he
finds a black ring-binder which he takes out and lays on the
table.

It is a book of faces. There are about fifteen sheets in the
binder. Some of them are genuine photographic prints, some
photocopies of original photos. They range widely in age, race,
and sex. They are all full-face portraits. Chronologically, the
range is extensive too. Some pictures (generally photocopies)
appear to date from the earliest days of photography, the late
1880's, others have an Edwardian appearance, or suggest the
1920's. Only one or two seem to be less than thirty years old.

KYLE flicks back and forward in the book, wondering on the
significance of these people.

He is lost in the musings when the click of the front door tells
him MALAHIDE has returned.

KYLE closes the book and quickly slips it back into the drawer.
He heads rapidly for the window he came in through but realises
MALAHIDE is too close for him to open it and make good his
escape. Instead he stands between the window and the curtains,
pulling the latter closed over him.

MALAHIDE enters the room, leading BROWNING who is still strait-
jacketed.


44    INT.    BEHIND THE CURTAIN        NIGHT

We see KYLE standing very still in the limited space behind the
curtains. It is clearly seen that, given the thoroughness with
which he closed the curtains and his immobile position, he is
unable to see what is happening in the room. He can hear, but not
see.


45   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM    NIGHT

MALAHIDE leads BROWNING across to the mattress. Standing beside
it, he unbuckles and removes the strait-jacket from his patient.

BROWNING, beneath the strait-jacket, is naked to the waist. His
arms and cheat are a mass of scars of various age and size.

MALAHIDE gestures to the mattress. Now that his arms are free,
BROWNING is scratching furiously.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Mr. Browning. Please, lie down.

BROWNING lies down, still scratching, trust and hope in his eyes.


46  INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   BROWNING'S DELUSION  (BROWNING'S P.O.V.)

As if looking through BROWNING's eyes, we see his body stretched
out before us on the mattress.

The naked chest and arms are covered with raised lumps, red and
painful-looking.

As his scratching arms attack these lumps, they break open,
revealing vile black insects that have hatched beneath his skin.
BROWNING brushes these away while he scratches at the remaining
lumps.


47   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   NIGHT

BROWNING has already re-opened some of the more recent scars, and
blood slowly rises to the surface of his skin.

MALAHIDE walks over to his writing tableland goes into one of
the drawers.

He produces an old-fashioned cut-throat razor and walks back to
BROWNING

                            MALAHIDE
                  Here. This will help.

He proffers the razor. BROWNING siezes it. MALAHIDE steps back
quickly, a mixture of anticipation and apprehension on his face.

BROWNING slashes at his body and left arm with a short, sharp,
slicing motions. In his mind, he is lancing the cysts that
contain the tormenting insects. In reality, he is inflicting
horrifying damage on himself.

Blood pours from the multitude of wounds, running over his body
and down onto the mattress.

Suddenly, without any preliminaries, two painfully thin, flayed,
mucus-covered arms shoot out of the mattress, one on either side
of the still-busy BROWNING.

They wrap themselves tightly across his chest and crush him
tightly to the mattress, as a head, similarly wasted, oozes out
of the mattress to the side of BROWNING's head.

Beneath his delusions, BROWNING suddenly has an inkling of what is
happening to him. His eyes widen and his mouth opens ready to
emit a scream but the monster beneath him forces a hand over his
mouth as it buries its face into the soft flesh of his neck.

Two legs now rise from the oozing slime that the bloodstains on
the mattress have become. They too wrap themselves around
BROWNING so that he is held tight.

Finally, with titanic effort, he gathers enough momentum to roll
completely free of the mattress and falls to the floor beside it.
The thing on his back now is pulling free from the bed of
bubbling, frothing slime that the mattress now is with a sliding,
slurping sound.

The monster's face is now deep in the flesh of his throat, and
even as BROWNING forces himself up first onto one knee and then,
very unsteadily, onto his feet, we can see him wasting away - his
face losing its fullness and colour, his chest sinking in on
itself.

The creature, which is still wrapped around him and clinging
tight is, unlike him, growing in stature by the second. Muscles
are inflating, arteries pumping more vigorously, and flesh itself
filling out.

Its horrific thin-ness when it first appeared effectively unsexed
it but now, as its regeneration continues, the fullness of its
hips, the roundness of its thighs, and the sacs of fat and muscle
that bloom above its ribs confirm its female nature. If there was
any doubt that this was JULIA, it is now disappearing.

BROWNING is now nearly a walking corpse and it is the strength of
his will alone that allows him to take a few faltering steps with
JULIA still enveloping him. With the desperate strength with which
she clings to him and the way her legs are wrapped around his
hips, it is like an obscenely perverse parody of sexual passion.

MALAHIDE has been watching all this with an incredible mix of
emotions playing across his face. Still human enough to feel both
fear and disgust at what is happening he is nevertheless awe
struck and exhilarated. He has waited all his life for such an
irrefutable demonstration of the power and the truth of the
supernatural.

Similarly, the scientist in him is fascinated by the living
anatomy lessons that JULIA's regeneration and BROWNING rapid
decay offer.

With one last dying effort, the now-almost-husk-like BROWNING
breaks JULIA'S grip and makes a futile step forward as she falls
from him. He totters towards the curtains.

Just as the audience think he will pull them down with him,
revealing KYLE, JULIA grabs his ankle and pulls. He falls back to
the floor.


48   INT.   BEHIND THE CURTAINS   NIGHT

The loud noise of BROWNING's fall renews KYLE's resolve to see
what is going on. Carefully, he shifts his position so that he
can see through a small gap in the curtains.


49   INT.   KYLE'S P.O.V.   NIGHT

KYLE may have heard one or two strange and unpleasant noises but
BROWNING has not screamed nor JULIA spoken; nothing has prepared
him for what he sees - a skinned woman sucking out what life
remains from the dried husk of a psychotic man.


50   INT.   BEHIND THE CURTAINS   NIGHT

KYLE's head jerks back, shaking as if he's just had an electric
shock. His mouth moves but no sound emerges.

                            KYLE
                           (mimed)
                  Jesus Christ!

His terror simultaneously urging speed and silence, KYLE gingerly
maneuvers himself out of the window.


51   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   NIGHT

JULIA lies back satisfied on the floor. She looks up weakly at
MALAHIDE.

                            JULIA
                  Help me.

Her voice is perfect. MALAHIDE stares at her, his fascination
intense. He crosses the few yards that separate them. He looks at
her, lying beside the hollow shell that was CHEYNEY. Her eyes
stare back, brilliant, sparkling, alive.

                            JULIA
                  Help Me.

MALAHIDE realises her temporary vulnerability; all the life force
she has absorbed from BROWNING has made up her body, but it will
take some moments for the strength to return to her.

Fascinated and sympathetic as he is however he cannot yet quite
brine himself to touch this creature. Instead he moves the
mattress nearer to her, allowing her to crawl back onto it and
lie down again.

MALAHIDE stares down at her. He attempts a smile, but is too
nervous to make it convincing. He is trembling slightly. This
contact with the beyond is something he has dreamt of for years,
but nevertheless the physical reality is overwhelming.

JULIA treats him to the approximation of a smile. She is far from
nervous.

She studies herself. Her figure is fully formed, her womanliness
undeniable. All she is missing is a skin. She stretches her arms.
She lifts her legs. She writhes on the bed in pleasure, like an X-
ray photograph of a calendar girl.

MALAHIDE stares at her, following the sensual movements of her
body. He swallows, a little embarrassed by his response to the
naked display he is privileged to watch.

JULIA'S eyes twinkle at him.

                            JULIA
                  Don't be embarrassed. You're
                  my friend.

She looks away and continues her stretching and wiggling, more
conscious of it now as an erotic display.

The strength has flooded through her body as she rises to her
feet, and stops off the mattress, smiling at MALAHIDE.

MALAHIDE backs away from her as she moves towards him, doing his
best to return her smile.

After a few steps, JULIA stops and simply stares into MALAHIDE'S
eyes. He too stops and returns the gaze. The camera circles them
slowly several times, studying them - the dressed, nervous man
and skinned, confident woman.

                            JULIA
                  Well?

MALAHIDE says nothing. Perhaps he swallows nervously. The camera
continues its circling movements. The scene FADES TO BLACK and
JULIA begins to laugh, small, sensual giggles at first building
finally as the blackness comes into an almost hysterical
crescendo of raucous joy.


52   INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

KIRSTY is again lying on her back on top of the bed. She is a
stark contrast to JULIA. No display. No laughter.

Her eyes are open and red-rimmed from weeping now. There is also
complete silence.

All the more jarring, then, the sudden sound of someone fumbling
at the handle of KIRSTY'S door.

Her eyes widen in alarm and she flings herself off the bed,
scanning the room for anything that can be used as a weapon.
There is nothing but the chair and she she has all but lifted it
aloft when she sees that it is KYLE, who comes into the room.

                            KIRSTY
                  Shit, Kyle. This is getting to
                  be a habit. What is it, some
                  kind of shock-therapy?

She was angry, relieved, and amused when she realized it was KYLE
and all these showed in her voice and face. Now they drop away
completely, replaced by a nervous apprehension as she becomes
aware of the blank horror on his face.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, Jesus. What is it?

KYLE opens his mouth a few times, as if unsure what to say.

                            KYLE
                  It's all true.


53   INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM   NIGHT

TIFFANY walks around her room, staring at her completed puzzles -
those on the wall and the one on the floor - and waiting for the
next one.

FADE OUT

FADE IN


54   EXT.   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

A simple shot tells us it is the next morning.


55   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

MALAHIDE , dressed in a black suit, is in the room, staring at
the empty mattress. We TRACK with him through to his LIVING ROOM.


56   INT.   LIVING ROOM  MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

In contrast to the secret and private obsession room, this room
is the tasteful and upmarket room of the successful professional.

It is a long spacious room with modern furniture and white walls.
The walls are mostly free of decoration save for two or three
large canvases of abstract art.

The longest wall is broken up only by a low circular table, which
rests against it about half way down. On this table is a very
simple black vase containing a spray of beautiful white lilies.
Above this vase on the wall is a large frameless mirror.

As MALAHIDE enters, the first thing he sees is a bloody palm-
print on one of his white walls. He blinks at it and looks down
into the room. We CUT TO;

JULIA. At first it seems she is staring at the lilies, but as we
TRACK around her, we realise she is staring at the reflection of
her skinned self.

Her face snarls at herself, she roars with rage, forms her hand
into a fist and shatters the mirror.

MALAHIDE rushes towards her. She swings round and freezes him
with a glance.

They hold their positions for a moment, MALAHIDE nervous and
JULIA furious, and then JULIA makes herself relax. She sighs,
takes a few deep breaths, and then speaks.

                            JULIA
                  I'm cold.

TIME CUT


57   INT.   LIVING ROOM   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

CLOSE UP on a strangely Art Deco electric fan heater, with bright
red coils emitting waves of heat.

We pull out to see MALAHIDE standing by the table with the flowers.
There is now a half-full glass of wine on the table, along with
an ashtray where a cigarette burns away ignored. A pack of
cigarettes is now visible in the breast pocket of MALAHIDE's jacket.

JULIA enters the room and closes the door behind her. She is
dressed in one of MALAHIDE'S suits. It is a light weight suit of
white linen, a suit for expensive holidays in hot countries.

She crosses the room to the table; pausing slightly in the centre
of the room, to allow MALAHIDE to look at her.

                            JULIA
                  Well?

MALAHIDE'S nervousness has retreated a little, he manages to
smile. He nods his head slowly a few times.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Yes... Yes. You look...

                            JULIA
                  Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?

                            MALAHIDE
                  No. You look...

He pauses, lost for words.

JULIA doesn't wait for an answer. She crosses to the table and
takes up his glass of wine. She downs it in one.

MALAHIDE stares at her, a little surprised.

                            JULIA
                  Yes, I still like WINE ...

She smiles strangely at him and then moves closer. Slowly,
keeping her eyes on his, she reaches into his breast pocket
for his packet of cigarettes and places one in her mouth.

                            JULIA
                  ... and more.

For a moment, MALAHIDE's face is stone. Then, slowly, he returns
her smile and, drawing his lighter, lights her cigarette.


58   INT.   SHOPPING MALL   DAY

A large multi-level shopping complex obviously up-market and
expensive.

We see MALAHIDE, riding up one on the central escalators, looking
around him as he does so, as if searching for a specific shop.

He reaches the next level and begins to walk along one of the
several avenues that lead away from the central square containing
the escalators.

He walks past several shops, looking in their windows; a chic
specialty shop, a window full of clocks, a cutler's. Finally,
he stops in front of one. He stares at its display window.

The window is classily minimal. There is in fact only one dress
in it. It is an exquisite white cocktail gown. The gown is full
length but quite tight-fitting, merely flaring a little from
below the knee, and has a halter-neck.

MALAHIDE walks into the shop.


59   INT.   MALAHIDE'S BEDROOM   DAY

We are looking at a reflection of MALAHIDE in the large mirror
that covers the inside of his wardrobe door. His real hand and
his reflected hand come together at the edge of the door and tip
it slightly, changing the image that the mirror shows us.

Now we see JULIA. She is in the dress from the shop in the mall.
It is a perfect fit and shows her figure off very well. Being a
halter-neck, however, her skinned arms and shoulders are
completely bare. Also, it is quite low cut at the front, exposing
a fair degree of visceral cleavage, and at the back.

JULIA turns fully around in front of the mirror examining herself
from every angle. Her mood is unreadable until she speaks.

                            JULIA
                  Close it.

MALAHIDE does so. He understands and tries to console her..

                            MALAHIDE
                  It's a beautiful dress...

                            JULIA
                  I know.

TIME CUT


59   INT.   LIVING ROOM   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

CLOSE UP MALAHIDE'S hands applying wide, white, surgical
bandages to JULIA.

We pull out as MALAHIDE steps away from JULIA. They are both
standing in the middle of the living room floor.

JULIA'S arms, torso, and head are now completely enclosed in
neatly and professionally applied bandages. There are three slits
for her eyes and mouth but apart from these she is completely
covered. Over these she is still wearing the white dress.

                            MALAHIDE
                  There...

JULIA lifts her arms slightly to look at them and then touches her
bandaged face. She turns towards MALAHIDE. The camera begins the
same circling movement it made around them the previous night.

MALAHIDE'S nervousness has practically disappeared. He has helped
this woman. He has bandaged her and dressed her. He is slightly
in awe of her, but it is now tinged with excitement, not fear.

The camera's circling grows faster.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Well?

JULIA walks towards him, slowly raising her hands. When she is
close enough her hands cup his cheeks. She pulls him towards her,
and, tipping her head to one side, kisses him. Her body moulds
itself to his.

She leans her head back. Were they have kissed blood has pressed
up onto the bandage from her skinned flesh. It looks like smeared
lipstick.

                            JULIA
                  Well?

MALAHIDE puts his arms around her waist. They kiss tenderly.
Slowly, almost nervously, he lowers his hands until they rest on
her buttocks and presses her in towards him. They begin to spin
themselves now, echoing the camera movements.

They cross the room, kissing blindly, until they come to rest
against the wall that bears JULIA's bloody palm print. JULIA
twists their bodies so that MALAHIDE is pressed against the wall,
and begins to move her hips forcefully and sensually against
MALAHIDE.

The camera is stationary now, watching without movement as
MALAHIDE begins to raise JULIA's dress up her legs, her hand
on his wrist, helping and encouraging.

About halfway up the thigh, the bandaging disappears and the
raw flesh is exposed.

The kissing and the fumbling continue until they are making
fast and violent love against the wall.

His hands clutch tightly at her hips and he pulls his face away
from the kissing to loan it on her shoulder so that we see his
face as it grimaces in ecstasy.

He cries out and shudders and slowly both their movements stop.

He strokes at her back gently and their bodies relax.

                            JULIA
                     (almost coyly)
                  Now all we need is a skin.


60   INT.   BATHROOM KYLE'S APARTMENT   DAY

CLOSE UP on shower jets hitting KIRSTY's face and naked
shoulders.

Her eyes are closed, but she smiles in pleasure as the water
refreshes her.

A knocking is heard. KIRSTY moves her head out of the water's
path and shouts.

                            KIRSTY
                  Yeah?


61   INT.   KYLE'S APARTMENT   DAY

It is basically a studio apartment - everything except the bathroom
facilities is in the one room. There is a sofa - with sheets and
blankets on it - a bed, a dining/all-purpose table with two
chairs, shelves full of records and books, and a small working
desk against one of the walls. The desk is weighed down by text
books and notes and, tacked to the wall above it, are medical prints,
some of the brain and central nervous system, but also two fullcoloured
anatomical prints - one of a man and one of a woman. They could
almost be portraits of JULIA and FRANK.

KYLE, fully dressed, is standing by the bathroom door, his hand
still in a knocking position.

                            KYLE
                  You O.K.?

Silence.

                            KYLE
                  Kirsty? You 0. K.?

The bathroom door opens and KIRSTY Comes into the main room,
dressed in a toweling robe that is clearly a 'hers' not a 'his'.

She crosses the room to a mirror, rubbing at her wet hair with a
towel.

                            KIRSTY
                  No bad dreams.

                            KYLE
                  So you slept O.K.?

KIRSTY gestures at the sofa.

                            KIRSTY
                  As much as that bed of
                  nails allowed.

KYLE glances meaningfully at the bed as he replies.

                            KYLE
                  Well, the sofa isn't often used
                  for sleeping on...

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh yeah? On your own a lot,
                  Huh?

KYLE grins.

                            KYLE
                  Like the robe?

KIRSTY returns the smile via the mirror.

KYLE crosses the room to sit at his dining table. Empty coffee
cups, the remnants of a loaf and some cheese suggests their
breakfast was simple and finished some time ago.

KIRSTY gathers her clothes from by the sofa and moves back into
the bathroom to dress.

KYLE waits a few moments and then speaks.

                            KYLE
                  I think I need to talk. About
                  what I saw.

KIRSTY emerges, fully dressed, her hair still damp.

                            KIRSTY
                  You thought I was crazy, didn't
                  you?

KYLE spreads his hands wide.

                            KYLE
                  Jesus, yes! What do you expect.
                  I mean, God, I still do! It's
                  just that now I'm crazy too.

He grins wryly. KIRSTY moves to the sofa and sits down.

                            KIRSTY
                  And you're sure it was a woman?

                            KYLE
                  God, I wish I could say no.
                  This is going to do terrible
                  things to my attitude, you know.

KIRSTY grins at him.

                            KIRSTY
                  Don't worry about it. Your
                  attitude sucks anyway.

                            KYLE
                  Hey, so for it. Don't let pity
                  stop you. I'm down. Nail me.

For a moment, they laugh together but then stop.  KIRSTY stares
downward and then suddenly bursts into tears.

                            KIRSTY
                  What can I do? How can I
                  save him?

KYLE joins her on the sofa. He offers an arm but she shakes it
off.

                            KIRSTY
                  The box. I need the box.

                            KYLE
                  The box? Like in your story?
                  Like in his house?

KIRSTY's tears suddenly stop. She looks at KYLE.

                            KIRSTY
                           (sharply)
                  What?

                            KYLE
                  The Boxes. In the House. I
                  told you.

                            KIRSTY
                  What do you mean?

                            KYLE
                  The boxes! I TOLD you.

                            KIRSTY
                  You DIDN'T tell me. Do you
                  mean Malahide's got...

                            KYLE
                  Yeah. The things you were
                  talking about.

KIRSTY heads instantly for KYLE'S door.

                            KIRSTY
                  I'm going.

KYLE runs across the room and puts a restraining hand on his
door.

                            KYLE
                  Wait a minute. What do you mean,
                  'I'm going?' TO the HOUSE?

KIRSTY nods and pulls at the door handle.

                            KIRSTY
                  Get out of the way.

                            KYLE
                  Are you crazy?

                            KIRSTY
                  I don't know, Kyle. You're the
                  fucking expert. Now get out of
                  the way!

                            KYLE
                  WHY?

                            KIRSTY
                          (shouting)
                  Because I'm going to get my father!

Tears start to her eyes and she stares at KYLE defiantly. Then
she repeats, more softly;

                            KIRSTY
                  I'm going to get my father.

There is a two-second silence between them as they stare at each
other.

Finally, Kyle backs away from the door, raising a finger.

                            KYLE
                  Two seconds. Just two seconds.
                  Don't move.

He rushes across the room, grabs a jacket, and moves back to the
door.

                            KYLE
                  O.K. Let's go.

                            KIRSTY
                  Kyle, you don't have...

                            KYLE
                  I KNOW I don't have to. It's
                  just my time of the month to be a
                  complete fucking idiot. O.K.?

KIRSTY stares at him, her face at first blank then suffused with
emotion. She leans across and plants a chaste kiss on his lips
then pulls back. There is a beat while they simply stare at each
other and suddenly they are tight in each other's arms, kissing
fervently. But the kiss is fuelled, not by passion, but by fear
and their mutual need for human solace in the face of the
unknown.

As the kiss continues, the camera pulls back from them.


62   INT.   THE BLOOD-BOUDOIR   DAY

CLOSE UP as JULIA (still bandaged) and MALAHIDE come together for
a kiss. They part and, as JULIA moves across the room, the camera
begins a long TRACK around the room.

First, it reaches a naked GIRL. As catatonic as TIFFANY, she says
nothing but her eyes betray her terror. Her hands are tied above
her.

JULIA moves in towards the girl, her eyes glittering with an alien
hunger beneath their gauze mask. As she nears the girl, the TRACK
passes them and moves through the room.

MALAHIDE has done his mistress proud. It had been an empty
upstairs room (no furniture, bare floorboards) but now it
resembles a nightmarish cross between a butcher's shop and a
bordello.

The camera slowly reveals, as it TRACKS, that there are seven
more people in the room. Seven dead people. Dried-out husks.

The TRACKING is now completing its circle around the room. After
the corpses, we return to JULIA and the GIRL - but the GIRL too
is now a hollow, dried-out shell.

JULIA moves back into the centre of the room and stands still.

MALAHIDE crosses the room to her quickly, drawing a wicked-
looking kitchen knife from his pocket as he does so. He reaches
JULIA and raises the knife to her face.

With one swift, precise movement, he slices the bandages across
the side of her face. JULIA raises her hand and pulls the mask
away.

The camera sweeps in toward her as she does this until her face
is in CLOSE UP as the bandage-mask is pulled aside.

Her face is perfect.


63   EXT.   MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

MALAHIDE emerges from his front door. He is still in his black
suit and looks every inch the respectable professional. He looks
neither left nor right but moves straight off, a busy man with
things to do.

A few seconds after he has gone off-camera, KYLE and KIRSTY
emerge from around the corner of the house.

KYLE gestures to KIRSTY to follow him and leads her around to the
window he broke in through on the previous night.


64   INT. OBSESSION ROOM   DAY

The room is much as we saw it last.

The window slides up and KYLE pulls himself into the room. He
looks around it carefully. Sure that the monster he saw the
previous night is no longer in the room, he helps KIRSTY in
through the window.

KIRSTY's eyes go at once to the three LAMENT CONFIGURATIONS in
the glass cases. She crosses the room eagerly.

KYLE rushes after her and stops her opening one of the cases.

                            KYLE
                  Wait! The .. thing ...
                  I want to be sure it's
                  not here.

KIRSTY nods and KYLE leaves the room.


65   INT.   STAIRS/LANDING MALAHIDE'S HOUSE   DAY

KYLE advances carefully, and slowly, from the stairs onto the
landing. He looks about him at every step he takes.

Ahead of him on the landing is a door, which is very slightly
ajar.

He advances gingerly down the landing to the door.

When he reaches it, he pauses. We see his face working as he
ponders his choices -should he push it open inch by slow inch, or
slam it inwards quickly?

Very slowly he moves his hand towards the door. The camera
matches his movement, moving in on his hand, the door, and the
space between.

His fingertips are less than an inch from touching the door when
another hand shoots into view and grabs his wrist.

JULIA has crept up beside him on the landing while all his
attention was on the door.

KYLE swings round in horror, his mouth opening to scream when he
sees that JULIA has her other hand to her mouth, her finger at
her lips in a silencing gesture.

There is of course, nothing for him to recognize from the
monstrous vision of the previous night. JULIA's arms, chest, and
face are completely re-skinned now. All KYLE sees is a beautiful
stranger in a white dress.

                            JULIA
                  Sssh. I think it's still here.

                            KYLE
                  What? The...The thing?

JULIA nods.

                            JULIA
                  Yes. I had to stop you going in
                  there because I knew you'd cry
                  out. Any normal person would.
                  It ...It's just TERRIBLE.

                            KYLE
                  Is it in there?

                            JULIA
                  No. Not now.

KYLE swallows, nods, and gently, pushes the door open. He walks
into the room.


66   INT.   THE BLOOD-BOUDOIR   DAY

The camera follows KYLE into the room. He reaches the middle
before horror and disgust stop him.

He hears a click behind him and turns to see JULIA has come into
the room and closes the door behind her. She looks at KYLE.

                            JULIA
                  Was I right? Is it terrible?

KYLE stares all around him. All eight victims have been sucked
dry. He is surrounded by dead husks.

His face is ghastly. He looks like he is about to faint. He nods.
His voice is a cracked whisper.

                            KYLE
                  Yes. Yes, it's terrible.

JULIA crosses the room rapidly towards him. Her face is a
picture of concern.

                            JULIA
                  Oh. You look awful.  You poor
                  boy. Come here...

As she speaks, JULIA's arms are opening out to him. KYLE sees the
comfort offered and advances towards her, too.

As they come together, the camera moves around them and we see,
for the first time, that JULIA is still incomplete; Her entire
back is still glistening raw flesh, the naked bones of the spine
still clearly visible.

Their arms go around each other just as JULIA completes her
speech;

                            JULIA
                  ...Come to Mother ...

As KYLE's hands touch the sticky, mucoid meat of her shoulders,
it is instantly clear to him what has happened. For a moment he
freezes in terror.

His arms fly from her and he throws his head back. But JULIA is
very strong now and her grip does not relax.

Kyle's expression is a mixture of terror and confusion as he
stares into the beautiful face of the monster.

JULIA smiles at him, a hungry, aroused smile.

                            JULIA
                  What's your name?

KYLE can hardly speak for fear.

                            KYLE
                  Kyle...

                            JULIA
                  I'm JULIA.

She raised one hand from his back to the back of his head and
presses his face to hers.

JULIA plays it exactly as a sensual, passionate kiss, her mouth
wide open, her head moving rhythmically and sinuously.

KYLE's reaction is somewhat different; his arms flail in panic
(though only from the elbow - JULIA'S grip prevents anything
more) and his head makes jerking, backward movements against her
pressing hand.

The camera moves around the embracing couple until it is behind
JULIA.

The back of her gown, as we know, is extremely low. As the kiss
continues, we see skin creeping above the line of the gown at the
base of her spine and gradually flowing up her back until finally
it meets and blends perfectly with ragged and raw edges of the
skin at her neck and shoulders. JULIA is complete again.

While this process has been going on, KYLE has been dying slowly
and horribly in her arms, his lifeforce being sucked into her
through their open mouths. His body, by the time her back is
completely formed, is shrunken, hollow, and dried up.

JULIA takes her arms from around the corpse of KYLE and steps
back, allowing the husk to fall to the floor.

JULIA licks her lips and looks down, not without affection, at
the dead KYLE. She smiles.

                            JULIA
                  Thank you, Kyle.


67   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   DAY

KIRSTY has found the black ring-binder and laid it on the
writing table.

She has separated one of the photographs from the others and laid
it out on the table beside the binder. It is the ENGLISH OFFICER
from the opening sequence. KIRSTY has obviously recognized something
familiar in it but she can't quite grasp it completely.

She is still puzzling over it when she suddenly realises that
several minutes have elapsed since KYLE left her there. Her
head straightens up and her puzzled look is replaced by a
slightly worried one.

                            KIRSTY
                          (to herself)
                  Kyle...?

She folds up the photograph and puts it in her pocket.

She crosses to the door and opens it. She does not go through it
immediately but stands in the doorway for a moment, her hand
still on the door, cocking her head slightly as if listening.

                            KIRSTY
                        (slightly louder)
                  Kyle?

She can't hear anything, but she regards that as a bad sign, not
a good one. She leaves the room.


68   INT.   STAIRS/LANDING   DAY

KIRSTY makes her way up the stairs. Unlike KYLE a little earlier
she moves up them quite quickly and advances onto the landing.

When she is on the landing and looking at the closed door to
JULIA's Boudoir she stops, standing still and staring at the
door.

KIRSTY suppresses a shudder. She bites her lip, takes two or
three deep breaths, crosses to the door firmly, and flings it
open, moving into the room even as she does so.


69   INT.  THE BLOOD-BOUDOIR   DAY

KIRSTY moves three or four steps into the room and then stops
dead. The door swings shut behind her.

KIRSTY's eyes flick left and right, taking in the sickening
details of the room's contents, and then stare straight ahead,
focusing on the figure in white which is turning around to face
her.

JULIA completes her turn and looks at KIRSTY completely
impassively for a moment. Then her mouth opens up into a smile of
welcome - but there is nothing but hate in her eyes.

                            JULIA
                  Kirsty! How nice of
                  you to drop in.

JULIA glances meaningfully at the dead thing that lies beside her
feet and then back at KIRSTY.

                            JULIA
                  You have surprisingly good taste in men.

KIRSTY's fear and disgust are momentarily displaced by a furious
rage as she realises what JULIA has done. Her face erupts into
anger and she screams out.

                            KIRSTY
                  Kyle! No! I'll kill you,
                  you...

She flings herself across the room at JULIA even as she speaks.

JULIA is completely unphased by this attack and simply raises one
arm. She siezes the wrist of the arm that KIRSTY has raised into
a clenched fist and effortlessly throws KIRSTY bodily back across
the room. We realise for the first time the immense physical
strength that JULIA now possesses.

KIRSTY smashes into the door and falls to a sitting position
against it. She is shaken and slightly hurt enough not to get to
her feet immediately but she stares at JULIA with undimmed
hatred.

JULIA throws a look halfway between a smile and a sneer.

                            JULIA
                  Oh, you can try it, you
                  little bitch. I'd love you
                  to try it. But I'm not just
                  the woman I was.

                            KIRSTY
                  What, you mean you're something
                  more than a whore with a vicious
                  streak?

                            JULIA
                  I mean I'm something more than
                  human, you little shit!

JULIA snaps this first line but then holds her anger in check.
She shakes her head and an amused smile plays across her lips.

                            JULIA
                  Oh, Kirsty. They didn't tell
                  you, did they? I'm afraid
                  they've changed the rules of
                  the fairy tale; I'm no longer
                  just the wicked step-mother.

The smile disappears and she delivers the next line with an
utterly straight face. It is, after all, the truth.

                            JULIA
                  Now I'm the Evil Queen.

The hatred and the heat returns to her voice.

                            JULIA
                  So come on; Take your best
                  shot, Snow White.

KIRSTY scrambles to her feet and again charges at JULIA.

JULIA steps forward to meet her advance and delivers a single
back-handed swipe across KIRSTY's face with such force that not
only is the girl knocked off her feet but is actually knocked
unconscious.

KIRSTY rolls onto her back and lies at JULIA's feet.

JULIA stares down at the unconscious body. When it was awake, it
was KIRSTY and her attitude to it was based on personal enmity.
Now, it is simply another body and she judges it differently; it
is firm, full, healthy, and young. We see the expression on her
face change from hatred and triumph to pure appetite. She licks
her lips and her eyes glisten. She begins to bend slightly
towards it.

                            MALAHIDE
                         (off-camera)
                  Julia!

The door to the room opens. JULIA straightens up and looks as
MALAHIDE stands in the doorway. Her eyebrows question this
interruption.

A second later, and it is explained. He leads TIFFANY into the
room.

                                               TIME CUT


70   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   DAY

TIFFANY sits cross-legged in the middle of the floor. She appears
to be alone in the room. Cradled in her lap is a Lament
Configuration, taken from one of the glass cases on the low
table.

On a wall behind TIFFANY, one of the large prints that previously
hung there has been taken down.

Revealed in the space behind  it is a large mirror. The camera
moves in towards this mirror.


71   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   ALCOVE   DAY

MALAHIDE and JULIA stand in a tiny and completely bare room. On the
wall in front of them is a large window through which we see a
back-view of TIFFANY in the obsession room.


72   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM    DAY

TIFFANY looks around the room generally and then turns her
attention completely to the LAMENT CONFIGURATION.

She picks it up and turns it around in her hands, studying each
of its faces intently.

She begins trying to move the interlinked pieces within it. At
first she has no success; the box appears to be one solid
construction with no internal movement possible.

She stops her attempts and studies it again for a moment, her face
still impassive. Then she gives a tiny smile and begins again.
Her movements are faster now, less tentative.

Suddenly, there is a click and one of the panels on-the box
slides out slightly. The little music-box tune begins to play.

To TIFFANY this is a marvelous reward - something the jigsaw
never offered - and she lets out a little sound in response,
somewhere between a sigh and a delighted giggle. It tempts her to
even greater skill and her delighted fingers fly over the box.
Another panel moves. Then two more. The tune is prettier and
fuller.


73   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   ALCOVE   DAY

MALAHIDE stares fixedly through the window, nervous but terribly
excited. He is breathing rapidly and shallowly.

Through the glass, TIFFANY's success continues. Small flashes of
intense blue light begin to buzz around the box. The room grows
darker and cracks begin to appear in its walls.

JULIA seems quietly amused - both by what is going on in the room
and by MALAHIDE's heated response to it. She glances from one to
the other, her eyes twinkling.

                            JULIA
                  You're sure this is what you
                  want?

MALAHIDE doesn't take his eyes from the window.

                            MALAHIDE
                  It's what I've ALWAYS
                  wanted. A view of ...
                  beyond.

He pauses. Perhaps he is being ungallant. He turns slightly
towards JULIA and takes her hand.

                            MALAHIDE
                  You were almost enough, Julia
                  but...I have to see. I have to
                  KNOW.

JULIA smiles indulgently. She nods.

                            JULIA
                  Oh, I quite understand.


74    INT.   OBSESSION ROOM     DAY

TIFFANY is completely engrossed in the box. She seems blissfully
unaware of the changes taking place in the room.

The cracks have widened in the walls and, in some places, pieces
of plaster have fallen away, revealing the slats beneath.

Blue light begins to stream into the room, ignoring the geography
of what should lie beyond its walls. Where the light comes
through the slats, it is as broad beams of light, given contrast
by the shadows of the slats. But it also comes through the
smaller cracks and enters the room in intensely bright and very
thin beams that criss-cross through the room almost like a laser
display.

Suddenly, TIFFANY's solution is complete. The central core of the
box rises up and twists itself around into its final position.


75   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   ALCOVE   DAY

MALAHIDE takes an almost involuntary step backward. His
excitement has now reached the pitch where it is beyond obvious
physical manifestation. He is perfectly still, his face perfectly
impassive.

                            MALAHIDE
                  She's done it.

                            JULIA
                  She certainly has.

                            MALAHIDE
                  It's coming.

                            JULIA
                  It certainly is.

MALAHIDE turns away to meet her eyes.

There is a beat or two where absolutely nothing happens.

The mirror explodes inwards into the alcove.


76   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   DAY

The room is filled with smoke and suffused with blue light.

Two of the walls simply part physically, revealing entrances into
the corridors of Hell. These corridors are lined with gray walls
and seem to run for a great distance.

TIFFANY still sits cross-legged in the middle of the floor,
staring about her in astonishment.

Surrounding her, in various parts of the room, are the four
CENOBITES from HELLRAISER.

The FEMALE CENOBITE smiles and advances towards TIFFANY.

The leader of the CENOBITES, PINHEAD raises a hand.

                            PINHEAD
                  Wait.

The FEMALE stops and looks questioningly at PINHEAD.

PINHEAD, at a more leisurely pace, crosses towards TIFFANY and
looks down at her. She stares back at him, the remnants of her
insanity a temporary defense against fear, her face registering
nothing.

PINHEAD looks up.

                            PINHEAD
                  No.

The FEMALE looks across at him.

                            CENOBITE
                  No?

PINHEAD shakes his head.

                            PINHEAD
                  No.

He glances down at TIFFANY again.

                            PINHEAD
                  It is not HANDS that call us...

He looks up and stares directly at the shattered two-way mirror.

                            PINHEAD
                  ... It is DESIRE.


77   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   ALCOVE   DAY

The wall opposite the shattered mirror has also opened up to
reveal a way into Hell.

MALAHIDE and JULIA are no longer in the alcove.

We hear the ringing of their footsteps. They are making their way
down the corridor.


78   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM   DAY

The four CENOBITES have gone.

TIFFANY looks around the room again. She stares from one entrance
to the other. Her manner is reminiscent of when she is making
decisions during her solving of puzzles.


79   INT.   BLOOD-BOUDOIR   DAY

KIRSTY is still on the floor in the boudoir of blood. This room
too is now suffused with blue light and smoke. There are no
gateways to Hell in the walls but there are several cracks in the
plaster and these appear to be spreading.

KIRSTY moans and opens her eyes gingerly. She puts a hand to her
face, rubbing at the place where JULIA hit her.

Still a little groggy, she lifts herself slowly to a sitting
position, her legs stretched out. Only when she has blinked a few
times, shaken her head, and rubbed her jaw again, does full
consciousness return - at which point she looks quickly about the
room ( possibly expecting another attack from JULIA) and notices
the light and the smoke.

She has been in this atmosphere before. She knows precisely what
it means. Her mouth opens and her eyes grow nervous again.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, shit.

KIRSTY scrambles quickly to her feet and rushes through the door
to the stairs.


80   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM    DAY

KIRSTY enters the room just as TIFFANY is about to go down one of
the corridors. KIRSTY screams at her.

                            KIRSTY
                  NO!

TIFFANY stops, startled, and looks at the doorway and KIRSTY.

KIRSTY raises her hands in a placatory gesture and speaks more
softly.

                            KIRSTY
                  Wait. Wait.

KIRSTY begins to move into the room slowly and shakes her head
gently.

                            KIRSTY
                  Hey, remember me? From the
                  hospital? I was in the next room?

KIRSTY is rewarded with a small recognizing smile from TIFFANY,
KIRSTY returns the smile.

                            KIRSTY
                  You don't want to go down
                  there. You REALLY don't
                  want to go down there.

TIFFANY turns her head once more to look down the corridor and
then turns back to KIRSTY. For a second it looks as if KIRSTY's
persuasions have succeeded, but MALAHIDE's training has been too
thorough; TIFFANY knows a puzzle when she sees one. She smiles
once more at KIRSTY and then suddenly turns and disappears into
the corridor.

KIRSTY stands still for a moment, as if she can't quite believe
that TIFFANY has done it. She shakes her head - half in disbelief
and half in despair.

                            KIRSTY
                  Jesus Christ.

Pausing only to pick up the LAMENT CONFIGURATION from  where
TIFFANY has left it on  the floor, She heads straight for the
corridor and follows TIFFANY in.


81   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

We are looking straight down one of the very long corridors of
Hell.

It has the same architecture as the corridor that appeared in the
hospital room in HELLRAISER; walls of stained gray stone broken
up by vaguely medieval-looking arches.

KIRSTY comes into view, walking away from the camera. Ahead of
her, at an illogically far distance given that she entered the
corridor only seconds before KIRSTY, is TIFFANY.

KIRSTY breaks into a slight run, and calls out to the girl.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany. Wait!

Her voice has an unpleasant ring in the acoustics of these
corridors and echos horribly. KIRSTY pulls a face and doesn't
shout again. She increases her pace slightly.

Suddenly TIFFANY makes a sharp turn and enters an intersecting
corridor. KIRSTY is forced to increase her speed even more.

KIRSTY too makes the turn into another corridor. Even as she does
so, she sees TIFFANY disappearing again into yet another
intersection.

KIRSTY follows and, again, the same thing happens.

This happens several times and, always, KIRSTY never quite loses
sight of TIFFANY but never quite catches up with her either.

In short, TIFFANY's instincts were absolutely right; this too is
another puzzle. The girls are lost in a concrete maze, full of
twists and turns and labyrinthine windings.

After enough turns have been made to completely confuse KIRSTY's
sense of direction, she makes a final turn into one corridor and
sees something different.

At the end of this corridor is a blinding white light. As soon as
KIRSTY sees the light, the air is filled with beautiful
birdsong.

TIFFANY disappears into the light as soon as KIRSTY sees it.
Despite the light, despite the birdsong, KIRSTY is still
suspicious and shouts out.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany! Don't trust it! Don't
                  Trust it!

But it is too late. The girl is gone. KIRSTY follows-and vanishes
into the light.


82    INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

JULIA and MALAHIDE are seen in the corridors of the labyrinth.

MALAHIDE's face is full of delight. He is absolutely the
enchanted visitor.

JULIA, on the other hand, walks with the brisk assurance of one
on familiar territory.

The corridors that MALAHIDE sees are different to KIRSTY'S; they
are grotto-like, dotted with stalactites and stalagmites and not
immediately unattractive. The walls contain portals of a glass-
like substance at random intervals that emit blooming lights of
different colors and MALAHIDE peers eagerly into several of these.

In one, the view is like an aquarium. An alien fish swims past his
eyes. Its body resembles a human brain but it has pincer-like claws.
MALAHIDE presses his hand against the glass as the thing comes nearer.
Suddenly, from within its body, the thing produces a perfect
human forearm and hand and meets MALAHIDE's hand on the other
side of the glass.

MALAHIDE starts slightly but then keeps his hand there. He is
turning his head to call JULIA's attention to this marvel when
the thing suddenly forms a fist and begins to beat against the
glass with tremendous force.

MALAHIDE jumps back sharply, but the thing shatters the glass and
leaps out at him. He gasps and runs up the corridor, the thing
hopping after him on its one hand.

As they pass JULIA, she tuts with the slightly exasperated but
indulgent tone of a parent or a teacher. She steps on the thing,
squashing it flat. It emits a horrible death-cry.

                            JULIA
                  Do be careful.


83   INT.   HELL'S SITTING ROOM   DAY

White light fills the screen and KIRSTY steps through it into
view. Instantly the White light contracts and disappears.

KIRSTY finds herself standing in a beautiful family sitting room.

The room is bathed in the warm light of a perfect summer's day.
The birdsong KIRSTY heard earlier continues but is, if anything,
even more melodic, even more sweet.

The room is vaguely Edwardian in its decor; real wood furnishings
and decorative porcelain ornaments. There is a large wooden
dresser, on top of which are many photographs in old-fashioned
brass frames.

Despite herself, KIRSTY cannot resist a smile of pure pleasure at
the appearance of the room.

She touches some of the furniture, as if to assure herself it is
real.

She approaches the dresser and picks up one of the large framed
photographs. She gasps in pleasure.

We see the photograph. It is a family group and looks to be have
been taken ten to twenty years ago. It is of a man, a woman, and
a young girl of four or five.

The man is clearly LARRY, albeit a younger version, and the
little girl has dark, thick, slightly curly hair - just like
KIRSTY'S. The woman is beautiful and has similar hair to her
daughter.

KIRSTY's eyes prick with tears - but they are clearly tears of
happy memories. She smiles.

                            KIRSTY
                  Mommy...

KIRSTY puts down the photograph of her family and looks around
the room again. A troubled look crosses her face.

Despite the aparent Summer light in the room, KIRSTY suddenly
realises what it is that is odd.

She looks from wall to wall with mounting distress on her face.
There are no windows in the room. And no door.

At this point, the odd discordant note in the birdsong becomes
apparent. It is nothing too obvious at the moment - the total
effect is simply less sweet than it was.

KIRSTY looks back at the photograph and snatches it up, with a
look of concern.

The photograph has changed. It is now a wedding photo. The
wedding of LARRY and JULIA.

Suddenly the photograph begins to bleed. Blood pours from the
paper itself, pressing up and smearing against the glass-so that
it is momentarily framed blood, without a single trace of the
picture showing.  The blood begins to escape out of the frame,
trickling over the lip that holds the glass in place and dripping
onto KIRSTY's fingers.

With a cry of horror, KIRSTY drops the frame. It lands on the
floor and the glass shatters. The blood continues to flow. In
fact, now that the glass does not restrain it, it fairly
fountains out, spreading across the floor.

KIRSTY steps back and glances at the dresser. Blood is flowing
from every frame, pooling on the dresser and overflowing onto the
floor.

By now, the discordant elements in the birdsong are very much
predominant and, as KIRSTY sweeps all the frames off the dresser
and onto the floor with a scream of anguish, the birdsong gives
way completely to a hideous, dissonant shrieking.

KIRSTY throws her hands to her ears.

                            KIRSTY
                  Nooooo!

She rushes at one of the walls and begins beating it with her
fists.

The walls are soft and pulpy and give slightly as her fists
strike, like flabby flesh. KIRSTY stands back in disgust.

The wall visibly bruises before her eyes, swelling and purpling.

The light in the room, like the birdsong, has changed utterly. It
is not dark, but simply dull, featureless, and depressing.

KIRSTY turns away in disgust and finds that the whole room has
given in to decay. The sofas and chairs are mildewed and rotten,
the wooden furniture is ridden with woodworm and rot. A skinned rat
runs across the room beside the buckled and chipped skirting board.

A rotten leg gives way under a small chest and the bottom drawer
spills out, freeing a whole family of quite large spiders which
run wildly across the floor.

Suddenly the room begins to fill with smoke, churned up by an
ever-increasing intensity of wind. The smoke obscures the screen.


84   INT.   BARE CHAMBER   HELL

The smoke and wind subside but not entirely.

KIRSTY is standing in exactly the same position in a room of
exactly the same proportions, but which is completely empty and
which has walls of the same gray stone that the corridors do.

Suddenly, rising up from behind KIRSTY, comes PINHEAD.

                               PINHEAD
                  Ah, Kirsty. And we thought
                  we'd lost you.

KIRSTY swings round in terror. As the mist continues to clear,
she sees, advancing to join PINHEAD, the FEMALE CENOBITE and the
CHATTERER. Beyond them, it is now revealed, that this chamber has
no fourth wall; it gives directly onto the corridors

                               FEMALE CENOBITE
                  So sweet of you to come back.

KIRSTY begins to work furiously at the BOX she has brought from
MALAHIDE's house. It sent them away at the end of HELLRAISER.
She obviously hopes it will work again.

PINHEAD raises a hand and the box simply flies out of KIRSTY's
hands and hovers in the air between them. KIRSTY stares, open-
mouthed.

                            PINHEAD
                  How can it send us back, child?
                  We're already here. And so are you.

Suddenly PINHEAD works at the box himself - by remote control and
with dazzling skill.

He turns the box rapidly through positions KIRSTY and we have
never seen before - even opening it out at one stage into  a
large, two-dimensional square. Finally, it closes itself down -
but in a wholly new shape; a white, multi-faceted, diamond shape
- and drops back into KIRSTY's hands.

He stares at KIRSTY and makes a small gesture with his brow. It
is ALMOST cute. If anything, it resembles the cocky, aren't-I-
clever look STEVE gave KIRSTY after swallowing the cigarette in
HELLRAISER. Then his face assumes its normal deadly blankness.

KIRSTY shakes her head dumbly and begins to back into a corner,
hoping that if they converge on her, she might just be able to
slip around them and get back to the labyrinth.

                            KIRSTY
                  No! You... You can't! It wasn't
                  me...I didn't do it! I didn't
                  open the box!

                            FEMALE CENOBITE
                  Didn't open the box. And what was it
                  last time? Didn't know what the box
                  was. And yet we DO keep finding each
                  other, don't we?

                            PINHEAD
                  Oh, Kirsty; so eager to play, so
                  reluctant to admit it.

                            FEMALE CENOBITE
                  Perhaps you're teasing us. Are
                  you teasing us?

To some extent, KIRSTY's ploy is working. The CENOBITES are
moving closer together as they advance to the corner in which she
stands.

                            KIRSTY
                  But I didn't open it! I didn't!

                            PINHEAD
                  Then why are you here?

                            KIRSTY
                  I've come for my father!

KIRSTY shouts this with brave defiance. PINHEAD laughs in
response, a very unattractive sound.

                            PINHEAD
                  But he's in his own Hell, child
                  And quite unreachable.

Suddenly KIRSTY makes her break shouting out as she does so.

                            KIRSTY
                  I don't believe you!

It seems for a moment she has succeeded. She swings around the
side of the CENOBITES and begins to run across the chamber.
The CENOBITES do not move but suddenly, from nowhere a hook flies
across the room, attached to a metal chain. The hook buries
itself in the wall only inches in front of KIRSTY's face, the
chain pulled tight and barring her path. The wall begins to
bleed.

KIRSTY screams.

The CENOBITES turn to face her, but make no attempt to cross the
room to her new position.

                            PINHEAD
                  But it's true, He is his own Hell.
                  Just as you are in yours.

                            KIRSTY
                  And what about you?

PINHEAD almost smiles at the naivete of the question.

                            PINHEAD
                  It's different for us.

                            FEMALE CENOBITE
                  We've always been here.

                            PINHEAD
                  We have no more surprises.

Suddenly, as quickly as it came, the hook withdraws from the wall
and flies back into nothingness.

PINHEAD puts out his hand in an expansive gesture.

                            PINHEAD
                  But, please; feel free.
                  Explore. We'll always
                  be here...


85   INT.   CORRIDOR

KIRSTY can't quite believe this but she has no intention of
questioning it. She runs into the corridor and away, with
PINHEAD's last words echoing after her.

                            PINHEAD
                  ... we have Eternity to
                  know your flesh!

Delighted CENOBITE laughter follows her back into the labyrinth.

KIRSTY drops the transformed BOX into her pocket as she
begins running through the corridors again. The labyrinth
seems tighter now - the corridors shorter, the turns sharper.
Corner after corner we see KIRSTY turn.

Accompanying this tightening, the light in the corridors becomes
gradually murkier - not quite dark, more like the oppressive
colourlessness that descends before a thunderstorm breaks.

Occasionally there are little hissing noises from the walls
themselves, which are accompanied by small jets of dull and heavy
smoke escaping between the bricks.

Over all this, there grows in volume on the soundtrack a
rhythmic, labored, resonant sound - a sound somewhere between
breathing and machinery.

Suddenly, as KIRSTY turns one more corner, a hand reaches out to
touch her.

KIRSTY throws herself back against the far wall of the corridor,
unsure whether to fight or flee. Then her face relaxes. It is
TIFFANY.


86   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

In another corridor within the labyrinth, MALAHIDE and JULIA are
walking.

They too have found their way into the inner sections. They too
are in tighter, sharper corridors where the light is distressing.
They too hear the machine-like breathing noise. And what is
revealed behind the portals in the corridor walls is less
ambiguous in its unpleasantness; in one we see CHATTERER in some
Hell's equivalent of a beauty salon. He is being re-made. This
involves the scar tissue being manually peeled from the upper
part of his face to reveal beneath small, vicious, human eyes.

MALAHIDE's attitude has begun to change, as well. His nervousness
now clearly outweighs his delight. He' rushes on to the next
portal.

If the last room was a beauty salon, this is the orgy room. But
the orgy is very strange. It is a very dark room, filled with a
faint layer of smoke. In the background, a bound man is having
his chest licked by a kneeling woman. She pulls her face back for
a moment. Her tongue is horrifically long and studded with short,
sharp blades. The man's chest is stripped of skin where she has
been attending him. His face is a picture of ecstasy.

In the foreground, three people are buried up to their waists in
the floor. They are naked. The one in the middle is a woman, the
other two, men. The one in front of her faces her, the one behind
has his back to her back. They are all very, close. The men have
various hooks in their chests, connected by chains to the unseen
walls and their faces are impassive. The woman is unwounded and
her head flicks back and forth, as if in the grip of a sexual
climax of stunning ferocity. The movements of her head keep the
details of her features blurred until, finally, it turns to give
MALAHIDE a three-quarter profile and holds its position, its
mouth open, its eyes half-closed in pleasure. It is JULIA's face.


MALAHIDE gasps and pulls back from the portal. The camera TRACKS
back to reveal that JULIA is still in the corridor, just a few
yards in front of him

                            JULIA
                  Come. I have such sights to show you.

MALAHIDE shakes his head crazily from side to side and begins to
back away.

JULIA looks at him and walks toward him slowly. She smiles. She
strokes his cheek. She moves closer, gently slipping her arms around
him and molding her body to his. She extends her tongue and licks
lightly at his lower lip. He opens his mouth and returns the
kiss, pressing her body more firmly to him. The kiss becomes
quite passionate.


87   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

KIRSTY and TIFFANY are now walking together.

KIRSTY is talking to her as calmly as her sense of urgency will
allow.

                            KIRSTY
                  Do you see? You were RIGHT.
                  This IS a puzzle, too. But
                  WE'RE CAUGHT in the puzzle.

KIRSTY stops walking and catches hold of TIFFANY's arm. TIFFANY
stops, looks at the hand holding her arm, and then looks into
KIRSTY's eyes.

                            KIRSTY
                  Yeah?

TIFFANY smiles directly at KIRSTY and then returns her nod.

                            KIRSTY
                  Yeah?

TIFFANY nods again, more emphatically.

                            KIRSTY
                  Yeah!

KIRSTY throws her arms around TIFFANY and hugs her.


88   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

JULIA is leading MALAHIDE down a corridor which has intersections
every few yards on both of its sides.

JULIA walks past these shadowed entrances without pause, without
a single sidelong glance. She is clearly confident, clearly back
on her own turf.

MALAHIDE, on the other hand, glances nervously into every one
before moving on.

There is also one last portal he looks into. He is gazing into
a room where the floor is a vast, seething pool of maggots.
Suddenly, something breaks the surface. It would doubtless scream
were its mouth not full of maggots. It is BROWNING. His nightmare
has come true; his skin is producing the maggots in a constant,
spewing flow from numerous sores that pack his face.

MALAHIDE turns away and calls to JULIA.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Enough. God, that's enough. We
                  HAVE to go back.

JULIA smiles at him.

                            JULIA
                  Go back? What an earth makes
                  you think we can go back?

MALAHIDE's jaw drops.

                            MALAHIDE
                  I want to go back!

                            JULIA
                  Sorry, friend. No day trips to
                  Hell. Here you are. Here you
                  stay. And forward the only way
                  to go.

JULIA turns back and walks an down the corridor.

MALAHIDE, with a glance back at the maggot pool, turns after the
now departing JULIA.


89   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

KIRSTY and TIFFANY are walking warily along a corridor when,
suddenly, the corridor wall parts with a roar. Both girls jump,
and TIFFANY cries out.

A new, and very narrow corridor has been revealed. The GIRLS
stare down it. It culminates in a door. Despite being set in a
blank gray stone wall, the door is normal. But frightening -
because it is an exact replica of the front door of 55 LODOVICO
STREET, LARRY's house.

Before KIRSTY can react to this, a voice issues from beyond the
door.

                            VOICE
                  Kirsty!

KIRSTY stops dead in her tracks. She looks at the door and
moves toward it, walking slowly down the corridor. TIFFANY
follows.

                            KIRSTY
                      (Very Tentatively)
                  Daddy...?

 Only a low moan comes from behind the door.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany. Wait here. If I'm
                  not back real soon - get
                  out. Get home.

Leaving TIFFANY in the corridor, KIRSTY opens the door and steps
in.


90    INT.   THE BROTHERS' ROOM

The door that KIRSTY opens gives directly on to a room.

Like the SITTING ROOM earlier this appears to be an ordinary room
and not a stone wall chamber.

It's wall-papered walls were once white but are now yellowed and
old. Overhead there is an equally ancient four bladed wooden fan
that turns sluggishly.

In the middle of the floor is a small low table of vaguely
Eastern design.

On this table lie a hand of cards, face down, an empty and cloudy
tumbler, and a soiled ashtray.

Over by the far wall (the wall opposite to that containing the
door) there is a mattress on the floor. A body like shape on this
mattress is obscured by a heavy blanket that covers it.

To the side of the mattress a latticed wooden screen stands,
hiding whatever is behind it from those entering the room. If the
atmosphere of the room reminds us of anything it is of the seedy
bazaar where FRANK first bought the LAMENT CONFIGURATION.

We are looking at the door as it opens inwards and KIRSTY slowly
and nervously walks into the room.

KIRSTY advances into the room. She stares at the mattress ahead
of her. Above it written in blood on the wall, is the message she
saw in her vision. I AM IN HELL:HELP ME.

                            KIRSTY
                  daddy...

A low moan comes from the far end of the room. KIRSTY assumes it
issues from the figure hidden beneath the blanket and walks
nearer, lifting her arm in readiness to remove the blanket.

                            KIRSTY
                  Daddy. It's Kirsty...

There is no response. KIRSTY arrives at the mattress and pulls
the blanket back. She leaps backwards, her hand at her mouth
stifling a scream.

Lying on the bed is a husk like figure, vaguely female in shape.
Despite its appearance of long decay, it is dressed in vaguely
sexual garments of leather. Suddenly, the eyes pop open,
revealing a vague remnant of life.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh God.

KIRSTY hurriedly, throws the blanket back over it.

A voice issues into the room. It sounds like LARRY but, as we
shall see, it is not.

                            VOICE
                  No. Over here. Behind the
                  screen.

KIRSTY walks carefully around the screen, giving it a wide berth
in case of a trick.

There is a figure standing against the wall behind the screen. It
is deeply shadowed by the screen itself but is clearly male.

KIRSTY gulps back a sob and her eyes fill with tears.

                            KIRSTY
                  Daddy... ?

The figure leans slowly into the light, speaking as he does
so.

                            FRANK
                  That's it, baby. Come to
                  Daddy.

KIRSTY stands still. There is a second where her face registers
nothing. Then she screams.

                            KIRSTY
                  NO!

it is her UNCLE FRANK, back in his skin and dressed in white
shirt and jeans.

FRANK chuckles. KIRSTY backs away from him into the room. FRANK
puts out his right hand in a placatory gesture. KIRSTY realises
he is not moving after her. She also sees that his body is
curiously angled, the left side still in the deep shadow cast by
the screen. Is there something else there? Something she can't
quite see? FRANK's voice stops her wondering.

                            FRANK
                  What's the matter, Kirsty?
                  It's only Frank. It's only
                  Uncle Frank.

KIRSTY's anger at being tricked wins over her fear and distress
and she shouts at FRANK in fury.

                            KIRSTY
                  I should have known! I should've
                  known he wouldn't be here! This
                  place is only for filth like you!

FRANK sneers.

                            FRANK
                  Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone
                  to heaven, eh?

                            KIRSTY
                  Yes!

                            FRANK
                  Shit. Bull. Shit

FRANK pauses and smiles. Then he begins to move more fully into
the room, shifting his weight as he does so and dragging what was
hidden into the light. KIRSTY screams again.

FRANK's white shirt is cut off at the left shoulder. His arm is
bare and, from the elbow down to the wrist, joined to another
forearm. The flesh is completely fused, like that of siamese
twins. As FRANK moves into the room, the owner of the other arm
is revealed. It is his brother, LARRY. KIRSTY's father.

LARRY, like his brother, is dressed in a white shirt (cut off at
one shoulder) and jeans and, like his brother, has his skin back.
His face is frozen into a permanent expression of terror and he
seems incapable of any independent movement, simply being pulled
along by FRANK.

KIRSTY steps back in horror.

                            FRANK
                  See? He's here. You should learn
                  to believe your Uncle Frank.

                            KIRSTY
                  No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It
                  SHOULD'VE been a trick!

                            FRANK
                  'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here.
                  With me. We're the same. Brothers.
                  Equal and opposite. Pure appetite.
                  Pure banality. Too much feeling.
                  None at all.

KIRSTY's fear of FRANK is now outweighed by her contempt for his
argument.

                            KIRSTY
                  You're full of shit, Frank Cotton.
                  My Dad wasn't like that at all.
                  He could feel. He could love. He
                  loved ME.

KIRSTY's voice breaks.

                            KIRSTY
                  He...he loved me.

                            FRANK
                  Don't waste your tears. Look
                  at him!

Her hatred for FRANK gives KIRSTY her strength back.

                            KIRSTY
                  He loved me, you bastard! He
                  Loved me, he loved my mother.
                  He even loved that bitch you
                  betrayed him with!

FRANK begins to move towards KIRSTY again, LARRY dragging behind
him.

                            FRANK
                  Ah, Julia. She hasn't been to
                  see me recently. That's why
                  it's so nice to have you
                  here, baby. Daddy's little girl.
                  So pretty when she's upset. Come
                  to Daddy,

FRANK is very close to her, now. KIRSTY attempts to run across
the room. FRANK siezes her arm and throws her back against the
wall. He moves in close and presses against her. His voice is
midway between arousal and anger.

                            FRANK
                  Now don't be naughty, Kirsty. Or
                  I'll have to punish you first.
                  Perhaps you'd like that. Would
                  you like that?

KIRSTY screams and stares pleadingly, at the still frozen LARRY.

                            KIRSTY
                  Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!

                            FRANK
                  I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.

FRANK leans in to kiss the terrified KIRSTY.

Suddenly, a hand appears at FRANK's throat and hurls him off
KIRSTY. It is LARRY, roused by his daughter's cries.

                            LARRY
                  Get your fucking hands off
                  my daughter, you bastard!

Suddenly, the room, previously full of slow movements and
tension, is full of furious, violent action as the fused brothers
kick, tear, and punch at each other in a paroxysm of killing
hatred.


91   INT.   THE CENTRE OF HELL

MALAHIDE and JULIA are at the end of a corridor. They turn into
an open space. A vast open space. It is desert-like in its
expanse, almost vanishing into infinity at its furthest reaches.
It is criss-crossed by catwalks, on one of which MALAHIDE and
JULIA now stand. Beside these catwalks, the ground falls away
into mile-deep, dark, abysses.

Above the catwalks, dominating the huge space, is the master of
the labyrinth.

The master, LEVIATHAN, is a monumentally huge, white, multi-
faceted diamond, spinning on its own axis, entirely unsupported
by any physical means, above its territory.

Apart from its very immensity, the most unsettling thing about
LEVIATHAN are the beams of black light that shine out from the
corners of all its many facets. Due to the fast spinning, these
beams shoot and swoop around the chamber, like a negative laser
display of dazzling complexity.

The sound that has been in the corridors is now magnified. It is
the sound of LEVIATHAN's breath.

MALAHIDE has walked the last few yards like a man in shock. Now
a black beam strikes his face and images of horror flash before
his eyes at almost subliminal speed. His face suddenly crumbles
into an expression of incredulous terror, he makes a noise
halfway between screaming and retching, and drops to his knees by
the edge of the catwalk.

Unfortunately, this allows him to look down into LEVIATHAN's pit.
Looking down with him, we are given a sudden and vertiginously
sickening realization of Hell's immensities. There is a drop of
miles visible down the pit and, all the way down, as far as the
eye can see, there are other catwalks cutting across the pit at
various angles.

MALAHIDE looks back up, his scream renewed by his sight of the
pit. Two or three of the beams of black light flit across his
face, filling his eyes with more subliminal images of horror as they
pass; a child, a knife, and a dead animal; a naked woman whose
private parts are made of sharp, oily, metal; perfect hands
ending in crumbling, leprous fingers.

Suddenly, LEVIATHAN stops spinning. Effortlessly. Instantly. Two
more beams are projected at MALAHIDE but, as they come within a
few yards of him, they become writhing pink limbs that fly out,
sieze MALAHIDE and lift him into the air. He screams out.

                            MALAHIDE
                  No! No! Julia! Help me!

MALAHIDE is held in the air as JULIA replies.

                            JULIA
                  But you WANTED this. You wanted
                  to SEE. You wanted to KNOW. And
                  here it is. The heart of Hell.
                  Leviathan.

As she says this two of the thing's facets part to reveal a raw
and gaping cavity lined with angry, sore-looking purple flesh
directly behind the dangling MALAHIDE.

The purple and pink walls of this flesh gash peel apart and open
in various places to reveal blades, hooks and needles at the end
of various vestigial limbs.

The limbs holding MALAHIDE draw him back inexorably into this
cavity.

He has one last moment to meet JULIA's eyes.

                               JULIA
                  Why do you think I was allowed
                  to go back? For YOU? No, it
                  wanted souls. And I brought you.
                  And you wanted to KNOW. Now you're
                  both happy.

MALAHIDE is now held within the walls of the gash. He opens his
mouth for one final scream but one of the tiny needle-topped
limbs flies at his mouth and sews his lips together with heavy
blue wire before he can utter it.

His eyes widen in both agony and horror.

JULIA smiles.

                            JULIA
                  Goodbye, Doctor. It's been real.

The gash heals itself, closing MALAHIDE within.

Despite the gash having closed over MALAHIDE, the leathery flesh
that covers that area is a mass of movement, ripples and bumps.
Small rips and gashes appear and disappear on its surface, allowing
us occasional and partial glimpses of MALAHIDE and what is
happening to him.

At one stage MALAHIDE's hand and forearm appear. A long deep,
running cut has been made down the arm and the flesh peeled and
folded back, revealing the meat and the muscle beneath. As we
watch, two of the tiny operating limbs sew the flaps of flesh,
still folded back, to the rest of the arm, leaving the wound open
and un-healable.

Another gash opens and MALAHIDE's face is visible. Here too the
needles are at work, diving into and out of his flesh in a
complicated sewing pattern that is finally pulled together
beneath one ear, leaving MALAHIDE's features permanently pulled
out of shape and decorated with running stitches of metal wire.

Again, MALAHIDE's torso appears, naked. Two large triangular
blades make deep parallel slashes down his chest. Two different
limbs appear but these have sucker-like tips rather than metallic
ones. They fasten onto the new cuts, as if battening. Instead
they are injecting - as becomes apparent when MALAHIDE's skin
turns blue.

The blueness, the conscious disfigurement, and the almost
decorative open wounds should serve to convey that what is
happening to MALAHIDE is not simply torture; he is being
transformed into a CENOBITE.

JULIA watches with avid interest.


92   INT.   BROTHERS' ROOM

LARRY and FRANK are fighting furiously, tumbling around the
room. LARRY is fuelled by righteous anger and revenge but FRANK
has had more experience of dirty fighting.

At one stage their free hands each have hold of the other man by
the throat and are rolling along one of the walls, each trying to
establish the dominant grip.

They smash violently against one of the walls in the room. It
gives and they fall through into the next room.


93   INT.   KNIFE ROOM

This is a small square room. With the exception of the doorway
to the BROTHERS ROOM, every inch of the walls is covered
with sharp and deadly-looking double-bladed knives -ie One blade
is buried in the wall up to a central hilt/handle and the other
blade juts out menacingly into the room.

The two brothers tumble into the room. Their grips loosened by
their fall through the wall, they land on the floor and
rise to their feet, staring at each other but taking in
the vicious nature of the room as well.

                            FRANK
                  How convenient.

KIRSTY comes through and gasps as she sees the walls.

                            LARRY
                  Stay there, baby. Don't
                  come in.

                            FRANK
                  Yes. Stay there. I'll be with
                  you in a minute.

LARRY and FRANK trade blows.

FRANK lands a powerful blow to LARRY's jaw. It straightens LARRY
up and FRANK slams the flat of his hand against his brother's chest.

LARRY flies backwards. He flings out his arm to balance
himself but he is nearer to the wall than he thinks and the
impetus of his fall drives his arm onto the knives.

LARRY cries out. FRANK grins and prepares to force his wounded
brother completely onto the knives.

Suddenly KIRSTY flies across the room at FRANK and beats at his
back with her fists.

FRANK snarls and, without turning around completely, flings her
away from him. KIRSTY goes flying but lands just safely short of
the deadly walls.

LARRY, in the pause KIRSTY gave him and galvanized by her example,
has found more strength. He pulls his arm painfully forward, clear
of the knives, and throws himself to the side, forcing FRANK onto
the knives. With a vicious push, LARRY impales his brother
completely.

FRANK howls, loud and long.

Without pausing, LARRY pulls a knife free from the wall and, with
one vicious slice, separates himself from his brother.

LARRY rushes to KIRSTY and helps her to her feet. They embrace.

There is a cry of horror off-camera. We pull out. TIFFANY has
followed her friend. She stares in shock at LARRY's wounded arm
and at the impaled FRANK.


94   INT.   THE CENTRE OF HELL

JULIA is being given more glimpses of the transforming MALAHIDE.

The major surgery seems to be complete. There are no spinning
blades of needles in sight as the gashes open. MALAHIDE's head is
completely bald and his face, like the rest of his skin is blue.
The only new sophistications are that his upper and lower eyelids
have been stretched wide and stapled to his face and forehead,
and that a new mouth has been sliced into what was his cheek
before his features were pulled permanently to one side.

Over the sound of LEVIATHAN's breath and the CENOBITE
machinery still at work on MALAHIDE, FRANK's howl is heard.

JULIA's head turns to the direction of this new sound.

                            JULIA
                  Frank...

She turns away without a backward glance and moves back into the
corridors.


95   INT.   THE KNIFE ROOM

FRANK is still impaled on the knives,  but his anguished howl has
Become  small whimpers of complaint (with, given his history with
the  CENOBITES,  perhaps  the tiniest note of pleasure in  there,
too)

KIRSTY,  LARRY and TIFFANY are now gathered together to one side
of the room near the door that leads to the corridor. They should
leave, but a kind of sick fascination keeps them watching FRANK.

FRANK realises only leverage will pull him free of the knives and
lifts his forearms up as much as they are free to.

He turns his palms to face the knives and, with a growl of self-
encouragement, drives them deeply onto the knives so that he can
begin to push the rest of his impaled body backwards.

It takes several seconds and much pain for him to succeed, but
succeed he does. He flops backwards into the room.

Several of the knives have stayed in him, rather than the wall -
his chest is decorated, or armed, with many blades.

Just as FRANK begins to stand, and just as LARRY and the girls
snap out of it and are about to leave, the door from the CONVEYOR
BELT ROOM opens and JULIA walks into the room.

KIRSTY and LARRY gasp. FRANK gives a slow smile.

                            JULIA
                  Well, well. All my family
                  together again. How very
                  sweet.

                            FRANK
                     (delighted/flattered)
                  Julia.

                            JULIA
                           (Flatly)
                  Frank.

                            FRANK
                  I knew you'd come.

                            JULIA
                  You knew?

                            FRANK
                  Yes. You're a girl who
                  remembers her promises.

                            JULIA
                  Oh, I do. I do.

FRANK grins, his grin taking in LARRY, KIRSTY and TIFFANY as well
as JULIA. He extends an arm to JULIA.

                            FRANK
                  And I know how much I mean
                  to you. Come here.

JULIA does not move.

                            FRANK
                  Come here. Kiss me. And
                  then...

He glances meaningfully at the others, perhaps stroking a blade
of one of the knives in his chest.

                            FRANK
                  ... we'll have a real family
                  re-union.

Suddenly, surprisingly, LARRY laughs. He is genuinely amused.

                            LARRY
                  Jesus Christ, FRANK. I don't
                  believe you. You don't know
                  her at all do you? You still
                  think you're in charge.

JULIA still has not moved.

                            FRANK
                  Of course I am. She BELONGS
                  to me.

JULIA begins to cross the room to him.

                            KIRSTY
                  For God's sake! He KILLED you!

JULIA doesn't pause. FRANK grins.

                            FRANK
                  She's forgiven me that. Haven't
                  you?

JULIA is now next to him.

                            JULIA
                  Do you really need to ask?

FRANK laughs.

                            FRANK
                  Show them.

 JULIA glances at the knives. FRANK shrugs.

                            FRANK
                  Just a small inconvenience, babe.

JULIA shifts position so she is standing behind him. She wraps
her arms around him, one stroking his belly, the other across his
shoulders.  FRANK leans his head back and twists it slightly.
They kiss.

JULIA removes her arm from his stomach and slips it behind him.
Nothing happens for a second and then, suddenly, FRANK's whole
body spasms.  We almost think it may be with pleasure until he
breaks from the kiss and we see the confused expression on his
face - and the blood bubbling at his mouth.

There is a ripping, bursting sound and JULIA's hand emerges from
his chest, covered in his blood.  Clutched in her hand is his
ruptured, still pumping heart.

                            LARRY
                  Jesus!  Out.  Out!

He shepherds the girls quickly through the door to the corridor.

FRANK's body begins to twitch.  JULIA holds it tightly.


96   INT  CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

They reach the end of the corridor.  It terminates in a T-
junction.

TIFFANY automatically heads in one direction.  KIRSTY makes to
follow, but LARRY hesitates.

                            LARRY
                  Wait a minute.  Why are we
                  following her? Who is this?

                            KIRSTY
                  This is Tiffany

KIRSTY shrugs.

                            KIRSTY
                  ... She's good at puzzles.

                            LARRY
                  Fine.

They take the turn TIFFANY has indicated.


97   INT  THE KNIFE ROOM

JULIA still holds FRANK tight.

Slowly, she raises the hand which holds his heart until it is in
front of his face.  FRANK's eyes are glassing over but he can
still see.

                            JULIA
                  Nothing personal, babe.

Without ceremony, she bursts the heart with one quick squeeze.


100    INT  THE CENTRE OF HELL

LARRY, KIRSTY and TIFFANY come running toward the camera.
Initially oblivious to the fact that the corridor they were
running along has widened and the walls retreated.  Suddenly,
they come to a stunned halt together, staring ahead of them with
awestruck faces.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh. My. God.

The camera moves around them to take in what they see.  They are
of course in the central chamber of LEVIATHAN.

LEVIATHAN is spinning again, the black beams flying around the
chamber.

TIFFANY screams. KIRSTY grabs her.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany, listen.  You've solved
                  it. But we've got to solve it
                  the OTHER way.  See?  See?
                  We've got to get out.

TIFFANY is frozen.

                            LARRY
                  Come on!

LEVIATHAN spins, the beams fly.

                            KIRSTY
                  Please!  Tiffany, Please!
                  Get us out!  Take us home,
                  please!

TIFFANY nods. They are just about to leave when LEVIATHAN stops
spinning.

A large beam flies down , carrying an object which lands on the
catwalk before the HUMANS, who all take a step or two backwards.
The beam withdraws.
The object at first resembles a large and bloody plastic bag, but
then internal movement begins to rip at this covering.  Hands
appear out of the rips and complete the removal.  We realise that
the bag-like thing was a kind of caul, a membranous after-birth
that some creatures produce their young in.

The thing inside completes its escape and stands clear of the
shredded caul.  Like a new-born child, it is stained and soiled
with amiotic fluids and blood.  But it is not a new born child.

It is a NEW CENOBITE.  And it used to be MALAHIDE.  The
transformation we caught glimpses of is now complete.  Its skin
is entirely blue, its head entirely bald.  The decorative wounds
and tortures we saw being applied are all present;  its flesh is
peeled back in various places, its features are threaded and
distorted by, wire, its eyelids are stapled open.

For a second it stands and regards the HUMANS before it.

TIFFANY gasps in recognition.

KIRSTY too knows what it was.

                            KIRSTY
                  Malahide ...

For some reason, KIRSTY draws from her pocket the photo she took
from the OBSESSION ROOM. She stares at it.

                            KIRSTY
                  Jesus Christ!  Of course ...

The MALAHIDE CENOBITE stretches its arms and flexes its fingers.

                            MALAHIDE
                  And to think I hesitated ...

It looks at the HUMANS again, its gaze finally settling on the
still shocked TIFFANY.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Tiffany. Come. I have a whole new
                  world of puzzles for you to enjoy ...

It reaches out its hand to her.

                            MALAHIDE
                  A whole new world of pleasures
                  for you to endure.

TIFFANY, confused and used to obeying her doctor's voice,
tentatively stretches out her arm to meet the MALAHIDE
CENOBITE's.

LARRY suddenly walks between TIFFANY and MALAHIDE.  The
expression on his face is strange; it is not fear, nor defiance.
It is simpler than that.  He is really, really pissed off.

                            LARRY
                  No.  I've had enough of this shit.
                  Who the hell are you?

                            KIRSTY
                  It's ...

LARRY waves a hand at her, but keeps his eyes on
MALAHIDE.

                            LARRY
                  Never mind.  Never mind.

He points a finger at MALAHIDE's face, which is attempting a
version of PINHEAD's imposing glacial stars, but frankly, isn't
quite making it.

                            LARRY
                  Fuck you and the horse you rode in on.

Suddenly, he forms a fist with his unwounded arm and smashes it
straight into MALAHIDE's face.  MALAHIDE is completely decked.

LARRY grabs TIFFANY by the shoulders and speaks
urgently to her.

                            LARRY
                  O.K.  You've done it before.  You
                  can do it again.  GET US OUT OF
                  HERE!

The three of them run back up the catwalk.

LEVIATHAN spins wildly and a myriad of black beams flow from it.
As they shine into the catwalk they become limbs like those that
captured MALAHIDE, but all with different tips; some are organic,
vicious mouths, some are hooks or blades, some are faces, some
are (as if LEVIATHAN Is too angry to be thinking straight)
beautiful flowers.

The limbs fly up the catwalk, but the HUMANS have gained too
great a start.  The limbs retract rapidly into the black lights.

MALAHIDE staggers to his feet, just as LEVIATHAN re-directs its
energy into forming and projecting one much fatter limb.  It is
dirty pink and segmented, like a vast earthworm.  The end peels
back as it flies toward MALAHIDE, revealing a cruel, metallic,
and rapidly-spinning surgical saw.

Just as MALAHIDE stands up straight, the limb smashes into the
back of his skull.  There is a distressing WHIRRING noise as
the limb seals itself fleshily to MALAHIDE's skull and the former
surgeon twitches and dances in horrible involuntary movements as
LEVIATHAN takes over what little mind remains.


101   INT  CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

KIRSTY, TIFFANY and LARRY are running, TIFFANY making the
decisions as to direction.

Down one corridor, blades and knives jut out from the opposite
walls at random intervals and they have to weave at high speed
between them. They negotiate the corridor successfully but, just
as KIRSTY, bringing up the rear, emerges from it, she stumbles
and half-falls. The re-structured BOX falls from her pocket and
rolls back a few feet up the corridor.

TIFFANY, who is nearest to her, helps her to her feet and, as she
does so, catches sight of the BOX (or white diamond, as it is
now). She makes as it to go and get it. KIRSTY holds her arm.

                               KIRSTY
                  No. Come on. We have to get
                  out of here.

TIFFANY moves away with KIRSTY, but not without a backward glance
and a puzzled expression.

They all make another turning. Suddenly, when they are about
halfway down this next corridor, a new gap opens up behind them
in the wall and a terrible sucking noise is heard.  Corridor
debris disappears into the vacuum.

Luckily, LARRY has reached the end of the corridor and grasps the
corner with one hand, seizing KIRSTY's hand with the other.
KIRSTY grabs TIFFANY and the three of them flatten themselves
against the wall, fighting against the suction.  The force is
tremendous and LARRY's finger are slowly losing hold.


102   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

CLOSE UP on a hand picking up the re-structured BOX from the
corridor floor they have just left.


103   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH

The sucking force is growing stronger by the second. Not only is
LARRY's right hand losing its grip on the edge of the wall, but
his left arm - stretched tight as it clings to KIRSTY and, via
her, TIFFANY - is bleeding profusely again.


Suddenly, JULIA appears at the top of the corridor next to LARRY.
In her hand is the white diamond BOX that KIRSTY had let drop.
She stays just out of range of the sucking wind.  She stares at
LARRY's weakening fingers and smiles.

                            JULIA
                  Oh, poor Larry.  You never
                  could hold on to anything
                  for very long, could you?

Suddenly, audaciously, his face set in a scowl of anger, LARRY
lets go of the wall.  Before she realises what is happening, he
has grabbed JULIA's wrist and pulled her off her feet into the
corridor. He lets go almost immediately and with a superhuman
effort grabs at the corner again before the wind can claim him
and the girls.

JULIA is not so lucky; without support or foothold, she is seized
by the wind and hurtles to the gap in the wall.

She manages to brake herself by flinging her arms out to either
side of her. For a moment she is hold there and then the pressure
begins to draw her in.

In her left hand she still holds the BOX, but her right hand is
only a few inches from TIFFANY's left.

TIFFANY reaches her hand to her, not knowing JULIA as the others
do. Their fingers just manage to interlock when JULIA's face
registers a disbelieving shock.

There is a terrible ripping sound. JULIA's new skin, so recently
gained, is giving up its hold and has ripped right up the spine.
JULIA is drawn from it.

                            JULIA
                  NOOOOOOOOOO!

With a final, slurping sound, the skinned woman slips from the
skin and disappears down the new corridor.

The momentary break in tension allows LARRY to make one last
effort. He rounds the corner and pulls the girls after him.
TIFFANY, finally, realising what has happened, screams in terror
and disgust, especially when she looks at what she has brought round
the corner in her hand. She drops JULIA's skin to the floor as
the three of them scramble to their feet and begin to run again.

Still clutched in the skin's hollow fingers is the white diamond BOX.

As they turn another corner, they see, very far in the distance,
a glimmer of light. TIFFANY points excitedly.

                            KIRSTY
                  My God, it's her room!

                            LARRY
                  Let's go!

He starts urging the girls down the corridor - a long and very
narrow one - but KIRSTY shows some resistance.

                            KIRSTY
                  No. No, there's something
                  wrong...

Before they can discuss it, a new rushing sound is heard. They
look back.

Hurtling towards them is the ENGINEER from HELLRAISER.

TIFFANY screams.

                            LARRY
                  Jesus. O.K. No more arguments.
                  Just RUN!

They begin one last panic-fuelled run down the narrow corridor,
the ENGINEER at their heels.

The sequence is equivalent to KIRSTY's pursuit by the ENGINEER in
HELLRAISER, the twist here being that as they approach the entrance
into TIFFANY's room the walls of the corridor, already thin, begin
to close together.

LARRY is bringing up the rear (the corridor is now so narrow only
single file is possible) and he can almost feel the ENGINEER'S
breath on his neck.

                            LARRY
                  Go. Go. Go. Go. Go!!

Finally, almost impossibly, they reach the gap in the wall.
TIFFANY tumbles through, then KIRSTY, and finally LARRY. Less
than a micro-second after LARRY has made it, the walls seal
themselves.


104   INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM    (2nd VERSION)   DAY

As we see clearly the room they have come into, we perhaps share
the feeling that KIRSTY expressed in the corridor; Something Is
Wrong.

The tiles that make up the floor are patterned as before but the
individual tiles are larger. The room itself seems more spacious,
the ceiling higher.

There is a bowl of flowers by the window. The flowers were in
full bloom before their trip to Hell but now they seem long dead.

The audience have to notice most of this for themselves because
LARRY, KIRSTY, and TIFFANY are too relieved by, and tired from,
their escape to take this in immediately. LARRY seats himself in
the chair, KIRSTY perches on the end of TIFFANY's bed. TIFFANY
however walks straight across to her window. She is the first to
notice anything. She stares at the flowers.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany ... ?

KIRSTY rises from the bed and joins TIFFANY by the window.

                            KIRSTY
                  But these were ... Daddy?

LARRY rises to his feet. Just as he stands, a fleeting expression
of bewilderment crosses his face. He strokes at his right arm
with an unconscious gesture as he crosses the room.

KIRSTY doesn't look at her father right away.

                            KIRSTY
                  These flowers. I saw them just...

She looks at her father. A sea of sweat has broken out on his
brow and face as he stares intensely at the flowers. KIRSTY's
voice slows, begins to trail off.

                            KIRSTY
                  ...the day ...before... yesterday
                  Daddy? Daddy!

LARRY's eyes close. His entire face screws up as if an
excruciating pain just hit him. He clamps his arm across his
chest, the hands clutching his shoulders. He opens his eyes and
looks at KIRSTY for a second, his expression one of surprise.
Then his eyes roll up into the sockets and he collapses to the
floor.

TIFFANY has hardly had time to turn from the bowl of flowers
before KIRSTY is kneeling by her father.

                            KIRSTY
                  Daddy!

LARRY is unconscious. TIFFANY gasps. KIRSTY looks up at her.

                            KIRSTY
                  Get help.

TIFFANY's eyes widen. She rushes to the door and disappears into
the corridor. Within two seconds we hear an emergency alarm go
off and TIFFANY re-enters the room.

                            KIRSTY
                  Pass me a pillow.

TIFFANY does so and KIRSTY places it under the head of LARRY,
whose lips are now blue and who is breathing very shallowly.
KIRSTY looks up at TIFFANY, despair in her eyes.

                            KIRSTY
                  What do you do? I just don't
                  know what to do.

TIFFANY shakes her head helplessly.

Suddenly, the door to the room flies open and two INTERNS - maybe
Stan and Ollie from the carnival sequence - come in, complete with
stretcher and gurney. They assess the situation with a glance and
it is serious enough to make one of them break their professional
silence.

                            INTERN
                  Coronary arrest. Let's be quick.

They are good at their job - within seconds LARRY is secured on
the gurney and they head for the door, KIRSTY and TIFFANY behind
them. The following exchanges are spoken on the move.

                            KIRSTY
                  Is he going to be 0.K.?

                            INTERN
                  We just can't say.
                  O.R.'s on standby. They'll
                  do what they can.

                            KIRSTY
                  But it's bad?

The INTERNS exchange a glance and decide honesty is best.

                            INTERN
                      (gently but flatly)
                  Yeah. It's bad.


105   INT.   ELEVATOR   DAY

The elevator is uncomfortably full, KIRSTY and TIFFANY squashed
up against the back while the INTERNS hold the gurney in the
centre.

The elevator is descending. The ride seems to take longer than it
should, even though they are going to basement level;like the
look of TIFFANY's room, it's ALMOST normal but just different
enough to make us slightly uneasy in an un-focused way.

Eventually, though, it does come to a stop. TIFFANY squeezes
KIRSTY's shoulder sympathetically (NOTE. RE: TIFFANY's character
- it should be clear to the audience by this stage that, though
she is still mute, TIFFANY is now a responsive, more rounded
character)

The INTERNS wheel the gurney out of the elevator and the girls
follow.


106   INT.   BASEMENT CORRIDOR   DAY

The basement corridor is long, cavernous, and not very pleasant.
It has a grimier, more uncared-for look than the upper floors and
the high ceiling is covered with an intricate system of naked
pipes and conduits.

The INTERNS wheel LARRY down this corridor, going so fast that
KIRSTY and TIFFANY are continually breaking into a trot to keep
up with them.

At the far and of the corridor are a set of double doors. The
nearer they all get to these doors, the tackier the corridor
seems to become. The walls now have pipes running over them, as
well as the ceiling, and several of these pipes are dripping
water into small pools on the corridor floor. The sound of these
drips is artificially loud on the soundtrack.

Finally, the doors are reached and the INTERNS, LARRY, KIRSTY and
TIFFANY disappear through them.


107   INT.   PRE-OP ROOM    DAY

This is a small ante-room to the operating room which is beyond a
further set of double doors. Without ceremony the two INTERNS
pass straight across this room to those doors and wheel the
gurney through, one of them throwing back a parting remark to
KIRSTY.

                            INTERN
                  Wait out here. A doctor
                  will talk to you when
                  we know more.

The double doors part and close, giving just a glimpse of the
operating room beyond, all lights, monitors and whirring machinery,
and the several gowned and masked experts attending to LARRY.

As the doors close, KIRSTY turns to TIFFANY, expecting a long
wait before anyone comes to speak to them. Surprisingly, though,
the doors open again almost immediately and two figures step
through. They, too, are masked and gowned in surgical green and
very little of them is visible.

                            KIRSTY
                  Is he going to be all right?

                            1st GOWNED FIGURE
                      (matter of factly)
                  No. He's not going to be
                  all right.

KIRSTY staggers visibly, shocked by this bluntness.

                            KIRSTY
                  Wh...

                            1st GOWNED FIGURE
                  No. He's going to die. He's got
                  a ruptured aorta. He's going to
                  die in agony.

As he makes this speech, the mask of his colleague stains rapidly
with blood, as if it is literally pouring from its mouth.
Simultaneously, his own mask is slowly pierced by a score of nails
bursting through from beneath.

TIFFANY screams.

The 1st GOWNED FIGURE pulls the mask and cap away from its face -
It is PINHEAD. His colleague does the same. It is the FEMALE
CENOBITE.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, Fuck.

She's had too much experience with these two to hesitate. She
grabs TIFFANY's arm and bursts through the double doors to the
corridor.


108   INT.   BASEMENT CORRIDOR   DAY

We are now looking along the corridor in the other direction -
back towards the elevator.

KIRSTY and TIFFANY come into shot, running rapidly along the
corridor.

As they make their way, a rumbling, flatulent sound is heard from
the overhead pipes and they all begin to drip blood not water.

We hear the sound of the doors flying open behind them.

KIRSTY and TIFFANY reach the elevator. KIRSTY presses frantically
on the call button, while TIFFANY looks behind them with
frightened eyes.

                            KIRSTY
                  C'mon. C'MON!

The sound of steadily-pacing, purposeful feet is heard coming up
the corridor, getting louder, coming closer.

KIRSTY begins hammering on the closed elevator doors. TIFFANY
stifles a cry with her hand.

                            KIRSTY
                  COME ON!!

Suddenly, the doors fly open. KIRSTY and TIFFANY tumble into the
elevator.


109   INT.   BASEMENT CORRIDOR   DAY   (GIRLS' P.O.V.)

We see the door-frame of the elevator and the floor buttons
beside it and, looking down the corridor through the open
elevator doors, PINHEAD and the FEMALE CENOBITE marching towards
us.

We also see KIRSTY'S finger jabbing frantically at the floor
buttons. The doors are not closing. The CENOBITES are getting
very close.

Finally, just as PINHEAD breaks from his determined but medium-
paced stride and speeds up eagerly for the last two or three
yards, extending his arm as he does so, the door slams shut
across our vision and we hear the elevator machinery start up.


110    INT.   ELEVATOR   DAY

KIRSTY leans against the back wall of the elevator, breathing
heavily. TIFFANY stands very still in the middle, a frozen
expression of fear on her face.

                            KIRSTY
                  Faster, you bastard, faster!

She slams her fist against the elevator wall. The elevator
stops. Its lights flicker.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm
                  sorry. I didn't mean it.

The elevator starts again.

                            KIRSTY
                  It's 0.K. They can't beat an
                  elevator. Not upstairs. It'll be O.K.

The lift stops, but this time it's where they want it. KIRSTY's
finger hesitates over the DOOR OPEN button.

                            KIRSTY
                  It'll be O.K.

She presses the button.


111   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   DAY   (GIRLS P.O.V.)

We are looking at the closed elevator door.  When it opens we
will be looking down the corridor on the main hospital floor -
the floor with the girls' rooms on.

The door flies open. CHATTERER II lunges in at them.

KIRSTY screams, but because of the eagerness of his lunge they
are able to get around him as his impetus carries him to the back
of the elevator.


112   INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR      DAY

The door begins to close as the girls straighten up in the
corridor and as CHATTERER II turns around to come back out at
them.

He tries to put his hand out to stop the door closing, but
succeeds only in trapping his fingers in the door.

KIRSTY, as soon as the doors began to close, had hit the DOWN
button. Now, she squeals with horror as she realises what is
about to happen.

The elevator begins to descend - we can tell this because
CHATTERER II's fingers move down to the floor and are then
sliced off.

The GIRLS run off down the corridor.

                            KIRSTY
                  This way. Short cut.

They turn into a set of double doors leading to a large ward.


113   INT.   LARGE WARD   DAY

KIRSTY and TIFFANY enter the ward at a run and then slow down to
a confused and horrified walk.

Every bed in the ward is occupied, some by men, some by women,
and every patient has in their hands, and is busily working on, a
LAMENT CONFIGURATION.

Despite this collective work-in, the BOXES obviously still have
the vicious characteristics they have previously demonstrated
when used individually - as is witnessed by the ten or so patients
who are struggling on with their work despite having one or two
hooks and chains connecting their flesh to their BOX.

KIRSTY and TIFFANY move slowly down the room, a look of
incredulity on both their faces.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, Christ. This isn't just
                  personal anymore.

TIFFANY nods slowly, her eyes flicking back and forth across the
ward.

Suddenly, the wheelchair patient from the earlier scene in this
ward, who has been between two of the beds on one side of
the ward, cuts across the GIRLS' path. He too has a BOX on his
lap. As he passes in front of them, he looks at them, giggles in
an unmistakably insane fashion, and gives them a conspiratorial
wink. Then he simply proceeds to the other side of the ward.

A second or so after this, as the GIRLS edge down the middle of
the room, they hear a rushing sound behind the double doors they
are heading towards.

Suddenly, the doors slam open and revealed in the doorway is
MALAHIDE.

But he is not standing there. He is hovering about two feet off
the floor. The umbilical limb that connects him to LEVIATHAN is
still at the back of his skull. His face is contorted in a grin
of manic glee as he floats three or four feet into the ward.

                            MALAHIDE
                  The Doctor is in!

He laughs, and the sound is far from human. KIRSTY and TIFFANY
stare at him.

                            TIFFANY
                  Oh, shit.

KIRSTY looks sharply at TIFFANY for a second,  as if she is about
to comment on her re-found voice, but instead simply nods. She
takes her friend's hand and the GIRLS begin to walk very slowly
backwards to the far end of the ward.

MALAHIDE is too enraptured of his new power to pay attention to
specific victims and so makes no move to stop the GIRLS' slow
retreat.

Suddenly his palms erupt into a writhing mass of tentacle-like
limbs as his head tips back to emit a wide band of LEVIATHAN's
black light at the ceiling, accompanied by, renewed inhuman
laughter.

Taking this as their cue, the GIRLS turn and bolt for the doors
at the far and of the ward and exit through them.

The limbs extrude from MALAHIDE's palms only twelve inches or so
and are all quite thin, but they all have independent movement
and they all have various surgical-like, gleaming tips. MALAHIDE
floats over to the nearest bed. He looks at the patient and then
looks at the bladed tips of his new limbs and, as if addressing
them, speaks.

                               MALAHIDE
                  I recommend amputation.

There is another burst of laughter as the limbs fly at the
patient, writhing, twitching, slashing, and slicing.


114   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR  DAY

The GIRLS run wildly along the corridor, not knowing MALAHIDE is
working his way through his former patients. They come to another
door and pause. They look back down the corridor to ensure they
are not visible as they hide and KIRSTY pushes the door open with
the flat of her hand behind her. Carefully, still looking down
the corridor, they back into the room and let the door close.


115   INT.   HOSPITAL/TORTURE ROOM  DAY

CLOSE UP on the GIRLS' faces as the door closes in front of them.
KIRSTY lets out a breath. Then they hear the rattling sound behind
them. They swing round and the camera pulls out to take in the room.

It is like the TORTURE ROOM in HELLRAISER. The walls are black,
the floor slimy, and the room filled with chains, hooks, and
torture-pillars. And, in the room and staring at the GIRLS, are
the four CENOBITES.

PINHEAD glances theatrically around the room, as if checking
something.

                            PINHEAD
                  Oh. No Boxes. Such a shame.

                            FEMALE CENOBITE
                  No more delays, Kirsty. No more
                  teasing. Time to play.

                            PINHEAD
                  Time to play.

KIRSTY looks at his unforgiving face and then her eyes suddenly
widen as she thinks Of something.

                            KIRSTY
                  Wait!

                            PINHEAD
                  No more deals, Kirsty. It's
                  your flesh we want to experience,
                  not your skill at bargaining.

                            KIRSTY
                  No deals! Just information.
                  Information. Free of charge.
                  No strings. Just information.

                            PINHEAD
                  Go on. But trick us again,
                  child, and your suffering will
                  be legendary even in Hell.

Carefully, making no fast movements, KIRSTY reaches into her
pocket where she placed the photograph from MALAHIDE's OBSESSION
ROOM. She brings out the picture that she realized earlier was
of PINHEAD and hands it to him.

He takes hold of it and looks, his face registering nothing.

                            PINHEAD
                  What is this? Someone else
                  you think escaped us, like
                  Frank?

                            KIRSTY
                  No, No, this one didn't escape.
                  You told me you'd always been
                  in Hell. You were wrong. Look
                  at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.

                            PINHEAD
                  Nonsense, I...

                            KIRSTY
                  It's you! You HAVEN'T always
                  been as you are. You were
                  HUMAN. Remember. Remember
                  all your confusions. Think!

The FEMALE CENOBITE strides across the room.

                            FEMALE CENOBITE
                  Enough!

She raises her hand towards KIRSTY. PINHEAD's arm flies out and
stops her.

                            PINHEAD
                  Wait!

He is staring at the photograph, that great immobile brow finally
puckering, as if something is stirring.

                            PINHEAD
                  I...remember.

                            KIRSTY
                  You were ALL human!

The other three CENOBITES stop moving and stare at KIRSTY. Any
advances they were making on KIRSTY or TIFFANY stop as the same
dim, distant, recollection begins to stir within them.

Suddenly, the door bursts open. MALAHIDE is there, still
floating, his voice still a mixture of hideous threat and
insane joy.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Tiffany. Come.

He turns his palms downwards, mirroring his gesture in the hall
of mirrors.

TIFFANY lets out a moan of terror and shakes her head.

One of the snake-like limbs from MALAHIDE's palms flies towards
TIFFANY's face. Before anybody can react, its scalpel tip has
sliced an inch or so off several strands of her hair.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Tiffany. Come.

KIRSTY throws her arms around the cowering TIFFANY and snarls at
her tormentor.

                            KIRSTY
                  Leave her alone, you asshole!

MALAHIDE makes no reply, but suddenly several more limbs fly
towards the GIRLS and begin to weave in front of KIRSTY's face
like snakes awaiting their moment.

At this stage, the camera CUTS TO the watching PINHEAD. He lets
the photograph of his past life flutter to the floor.

MALAHIDE looks up at the tiny noise this makes and his eyes meet
PINHEAD'S. He turns more fully to face PINHEAD and the other
CENOBITES who are now standing with their leader, and a strange
smile crosses his face

                            MALAHIDE
                  Oh,good. A fight.

Suddenly, the air is full of flying chains. MALAHIDE is hooked
everywhere. It is like a high-speed version of FRANK's final re-
capture in HELLRAISER. The chains start tugging almost instantly.

Is MALAHIDE about to be ripped apart?

With contemptuous, dismissive speed, the limbs that ooze from
MALAHIDE's palms have sliced the chains to pieces and, almost
before we have time to realise that, three of them have
lengthened, thickened, and hardened and have skewered the FEMALE
CENOBITE, CHATTERER II, and BUTTERBALL to the walls.

The three limbs detatch themselves from MALAHIDE. The three
CENOBITES are all well above the floor, pinned and twitching like
the rats in FRANK's attic.

As they die, they suddenly revert; there are three human corpses
on the walls of the room. A woman, a fat man, and a little boy.

MALAHIDE smiles. Be looks at PINHEAD again and advances. Suddenly
a heavy torture pillar smashes into him, knocking him slightly
off-balance.

PINHEAD is backing across the room, weaving pillars in front of
him as he moves. MALAHIDE moves forward, knocking them out of the
way. As each pillar is knocked aside, PINHEAD's face is more and
more human. Finally, when the face we see is nearly that of the
ENGLISH OFFICER from the opening, he turns his head slightly away
from the advancing MALAHIDE and finds KIRSTY's eyes. A look
passes between them. Understanding? Gratitude? Friendship?

Whatever emotion lies beneath it, it is clearly a cue and
KIRSTY and TIFFANY make a break for it, bursting through the
door. Simultaneously to this, MALAHIDE and PINHEAD find each
other's eyes a final time. For a second, everything is still then
a single bladed limb flies across the space between them and
neatly and calmly slices PINHEAD's throat open. The thin red line
becomes a torrent of blood and the former lord of Hell falls dead
at the feet of his successor.   


116   INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   DAY

KIRSTY and TIFFANY burst out into the corridor and almost fall
over the PATIENT IN THE WHEELCHAIR.

                            PATIENT
                  So what, girls? It's O.K.
                  for an ego-trip but it
                  doesn't got the job done.

Shaking their heads at the insanity, they run up the corridor.

TIFFANY looks slightly distracted and when she speaks it is half
to herself.

                            TIFFANY
                  I have to go back. Or it'll
                  never stop.

                            KIRSTY
                         (Confused)
                  What are you talking...

                            TIFFANY
                          (to herself)
                  I've got to finish it.

                            KIRSTY
                  Finish what?

Even as KIRSTY says this, TIFFANY has moved past her and is
resuming her run down the corridor.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany! Wait!

KIRSTY starts after her friend.

They turn back into the main section of the corridor that contains
their own rooms, TIFFANY still four or five yards in front of
KIRSTY.

TIFFANY reaches her room. The door is open. She goes in. A second
later, KIRSTY follows.


117      INT.   TIFFANY'S ROOM   DAY

KIRSTY enters the room. It is as we last saw it except that
the walls have re-parted to give onto the corridors of Hell.

Carefully and slowly, KIRSTY moves across to the entrance and
looks down it. She is rewarded with the sight of TIFFANY just
disappearing at the far end of the first corridor. With a
grimace, KIRSTY follows her in.


118   INT.   CORRIDOR/LABYRINTH

TIFFANY's skill at finding her way through puzzles means the
GIRLS are soon in the murkier corridors close to the Centre.

Hell seems angrier now, steam is issuing in jets from the
corridor walls, the cries of children are heard faintly on the
soundtrack, LEVIATHAN's breathing is more dominant, perhaps the
light is even pulsing in time with it.

KIRSTY is still several yards behind TIFFANY. TIFFANY takes a
corner and is out of sight for a second or so . KIRSTY dashes
around the corner to find TIFFANY staring with distress at
something on the floor.

It is the skin ripped off JULIA by the vacuum tunnel earlier.

                            KIRSTY
                  Oh, gross.

TIFFANY bends down and retrieves the white diamond BOX from the
empty fingers.

                            KIRSTY
                  What are you doing? What are WE doing?

TIFFANY looks at the BOX in her hand. When she speaks, it is not
to KIRSTY but to herself.

                            TIFFANY
                  I can't do it here. I have to
                  go to it.


119   INT.   THE CENTRE OF HELL

LEVIATHAN spins and fires light in the centre, his machine-like
breathing drowning all other sound. We are looking down the
catwalk as KIRSTY and TIFFANY approach its edge.

The beams of black light wash across their faces, as they passed
over MALAHIDE's in the earlier scene. Images of horror freeze
momentarily before them and then pass on, only to be replaced by
others.

                            TIFFANY
                  I'm scared.

                            KIRSTY
                  No. Don't let it. You've
                  come this far.

The GIRLS press on. Whether LEVIATHAN is oblivious to their
presence or simply doesn't consider them a threat, the beams stop
striking the GIRLS' faces. Nevertheless, the mood remains
ominous. The audience should feel something is about to happen.

They are six feet from the lip of the catwalk. TIFFANY kneels
and, holding the white diamond BOX in front of her, begins to
move her fingers over it. The music box tune begins to play as
the BOX begins to move.

That 'something' that the audience was waiting to happen,
suddenly does; MALAHIDE flies up from the abyss beside the
catwalk. The vastness of the limb that seals him to LEVIATHAN is
now directly apparent; instead of merging into black light, the
limb itself trails through the air over the huge distance to
LEVIATHAN itself.

One of the limbs from MALAHIDE's palms flies out and knocks the
BOX from TIFFANY's hands. It rolls perilously close to the edge
of the catwalk.

KIRSTY grabs TIFFANY and, dragging her to her feet, pulls her
further back down the catwalk as MALAHIDE floats to a landing
between them and the BOX.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Ah, girls. And how are we
                  feeling today?

The blades on the end of his limbs twitch eagerly.

                            MALAHIDE
                  You have your whole lives
                  behind you now.

The limbs fly forward. KIRSTY screams and both girls run up
the catwalk.

About halfway back up, however, TIFFANY stops, turns around, and
begins to walk back. KIRSTY calls out.

                            KIRSTY
                  Tiffany! No!

The camera stays with TIFFANY as she makes her way back. KIRSTY's
voice stays on the soundtrack for a time, imploring her friend to
turn back and then simply stops. This should be abrupt enough to
make the audience notice but smooth enough to avoid their
attention leaving TIFFANY.

MALAHIDE waits, happy to see a patient so keen on the knife.

Very slowly, TIFFANY moves forward, inch by slow inch. This is
something she HAS to do; the expression on her face is not
determination but terror. And MALAHIDE is very happy to encourage
this.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Surgery is open, Tiffany.
                  What was today's agenda?

His scalpels flick in the air, making small slicing motions.

                            MALAHIDE
                  Ah, yes. Evisceration.

Still TIFFANY comes forward, closer and closer until she is
surely close enough to be grabbed.

Suddenly, she is grabbed. But from behind, and by a human hand.
TIFFANY gasps, and turns to see who has seized her. She screams.
It is JULIA.

The limbs retract into MALAHIDE's palms. He smiles.

                            JULIA
                  Doctor. I've missed you.

JULIA, having presumably just replaced her skin, is not quite as
perfect as before; there are bloody lines like scars beneath her
ears and chin as if the skin required some adjustment before
being put on.

JULIA moves forward, her left arm still holding TIFFANY, her
smile returning MALAHIDE'S.

                            MALAHIDE
                  I knew you'd come back.

                            JULIA
                  I'm a girl who keeps her promises.

JULIA is right next to MALAHIDE now. Smoothly, she releases her
grip on TIFFANY and embraces MALAHIDE sensuously. He returns the
embrace. They kiss.

Unseen, TIFFANY moves to the edge of the catwalk and picks up the
BOX. Her fingers move over it, finding its solution. Suddenly,
LEVIATHAN's breath becomes a roar of anger and fear.

MALAHIDE breaks away from his kiss, his face a mixture of
confusion and rage. JULIA plants both hands in the middle of his
chest and pushes. He falls over the lip of the catwalk but,
almost before he drops from sight, he is suddenly pulled
backwards through the air, screaming, as LEVIATHAN's limb
retracts. JULIA jumps back. shouting.

                            JULIA
                  Do it, Tiffany! Do it!

TIFFANY's fingers fly over the BOX and suddenly we see what is
happening. The mountain-like LEVIATHAN is following the movements
of the small replica in TIFFANY's hands. As TIFFANY inverts the
new configuration back towards a closed BOX, LEVIATHAN too is
being twisted and turned. Being closed.

The whole centre of Hell shakes as if suffering a mild
earthquake. JULIA and TIFFANY almost lose their footing, but
TIFFANY continues working. She is nearly, there. LEVIATHAN is
halfway between its white diamond, majesty and a huge closed BOX.

TIFFANY takes her hands from the BOX. It is done. The larger BOX
operates a few seconds behind it's control, so that we can inter-
cut the final sliding and creaking into position with the
following human drama;

As LEVIATHAN makes its final closing, the mild tremors of before
become larger. Hell shakes violently and this time TIFFANY does
lose her footing. She looks set to tumble into the vast abyss to
the side of the catwalk but just manages to catch hold of the edge
with one hand. The small BOX flies from her hand and hurtles down
into the miles of blackness below. TIFFANY dangles over the edge,
her feet kicking wildly for a foothold that doesn't exist.

Suddenly, a hand extends to her. She looks up. It is JULIA. For a
second, nothing happens.

                            JULIA
                  Trust me.

TIFFANY lifts one hand off the edge and grabs at JULIA's
proffered wrist.

JULIA begins to pull up and for a moment it seems the crisis is
over. Then a terrible and familiar ripping noise is heard: The
skin of the arm that TIFFANY clings to begins to rip free at the
shoulder. Gradually, like a shirt's threads unraveling, it
comes off. TIFFANY's weight pulls it clear like a very long and
very tasteless evening glove and it seems she will finally make
the long drop. At the final second, as the arm-skin comes off,
the entire skin flies from the body and falls with its arm into
the abyss. TIFFANY screams. She is going to die.

But suddenly the two arms that have Just lost their skin fly out
again and catch her fingers. TIFFANY is hauled over the edge and
staggers to her feet, staring into the-bloodied face of KIRSTY,
who had donned JULIA's skin to help her friend.

The two girls share a quick and joyous embrace and then run
rapidly up the catwalk. The camera stays with LEVIATHAN.

The rumbling stops. And the mountainous BOX creaks into its final,
sealed position.

FADE OUT

FADE IN


120   INT.  RECOVERY ROOM  DAY

CLOSE UP on a bowl of beautiful flowers, sitting on a shelf in
the recovery room.

The camera TRACKS out to let us see LARRY, pale, drawn, but
basically okay, in the room's single bad. He is wired up to
various drips and monitors.

Sunlight is flooding into the room from a window and the camera
continues its TRACK up to and through this window to;


121   EXT.   HOSPITAL MAIN ENTRANCE  DAY

KIRSTY is kissing TIFFANY on the cheek. TIFFANY is dressed in
smart clothes and has a small traveling bag in her hand.

                            KIRSTY
                  So. What're you going to do?
                  Open up a games-shop somewhere?
                  Sell jigsaw puzzles?

TIFFANY gives a smile.

                            TIFFANY
                  Oh, yeah.

There is a slightly awkward pause.

                            KIRSTY
                  Well ... G'bye.

                            TIFFANY
                  It's been Hell.

They share a rueful knowing smile, like the smile of soldiers
back from a war who say goodbye on a dockside and know they will
never meet again.

TIFFANY turns and walks down the long path to the hospital gates.
KIRSTY watches her for a few moments and then turns and re-enters
the institute.

The camera TRACKS back to the window of the RECOVERY ROOM and we
watch through the window as KIRSTY enters the room. She bends to
kiss her father's cheek. LARRY slips an arm around her shoulders
and they embrace. The camera moves away again.


122   INT.   HALLWAY  MALAHIDE's HOUSE  DAY

The camera TRACKS slowly up MALAHIDE's hallway. The hallway is
lined with packing cases filled with items from the house. A
WORKMAN is shoving something into one of the cases. As the camera
moves past him, he speaks.

                            WORKMAN
                  So whose was all this shit?

The camera reaches the doorway of the OBSESSION ROOM as an
answering voice is heard.

                            2nd. WORKMAN
                  Not our problem...

The TRACK continues into -


123   INT.   OBSESSION ROOM  DAY
                    
and we see the 2nd. WORKMAN. He is crouching over the mattress
which is still in the middle of the floor of the otherwise empty
room.

                            2nd. WORKMAN
                  ... Gimme a hand with this.

Almost faster than the eye can register it, a hand shoots out
from the mattress and grabs his wrist.

He has about half a second to issue a strangled shout and then,
hideously quickly, a matter of two seconds or so, his body is
drained of all life and the dried husk collapses to the floor.

The first WORKMAN appears hurriedly in the doorway and then
freezes, an awestruck expression on his face.

JULIA is rising, headfirst and upright, from the centre of the
mattress. The movement is smooth, magical, unsettling. It is
graceful but not slow.

JULIA is fully fleshed, fully skinned, and fully dressed. She is
in a replica of the dress MALAHIDE bought for her, but this one
is jet black. She looks fabulous.

As the WORKMAN stands open-mouthed, her feet clear the mattress.
But they don't stop there. She slows to a graceful halt about six
inches above the mattress. She stretches and flexes her arms
sensually. Than her head swivels and her excited, aroused eyes
meet those of the WORKMAN.

                            JULIA
                  I'm Julia. Love me.

Suddenly, her head tips back and, accompanied by JULIA's
delighted laughter, a wide beam of Hell's black light flies at
the ceiling from her open mouth. Instantaneously, it spills
across the ceiling and falls,like a fountain of blood, across the
screen.

COMPLETE BLACKNESS.

               In a photographic DARKROOM: old optical enlargers, porcelain 
               trays, timers, and stills hanging out to dry.

               GEORGE MATLIN, a slightly obese, nearsighted man in his 
               seventies.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         Is he real? Oh yeah -- Absolutely.

               Super: CPL. GEORGE MATLIN, combat photographer.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         I haven't talked about it for years, 
                         you know?
                              (looks at the camera)
                         Everyone called me crazy...

               Matlin smiles as he paws through a box of old negatives.

                                     OLD MATLIN
                         But I have the negative.

               Someone turns on the darkroom's red safety light for an eerie, 
               dramatic effect.

                         Get ready, 3-2-1... Roll tape.

                         It all started back in ´44. I was a 
                         Corps photographer aboard an allied 
                         submarine...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUBMARINE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               YOUNG MATLIN's hands again paw through a bunch of negatives, 
               again under a red light. Now, at 21, he's wedged in a 
               submarine corridor, a crowded maze of pipes and gauges.

               35mm still cameras dangle from his neck. He shrinks back as 
               a squad of MARINES hustles past him, loading weapons.

                                     OLD MATLIN'S VOICE

               SGT. WHITMAN, 44, tough as nails, pushes through, his uniform 
               soaked in sweat.

                                     OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
                         We had an English civilian on board. 
                         Not much older than me but already 
                         an advisor to President Roosevelt. 
                         "Paranormal" advisor, I kid you not --

               Whitman continues down the passageway until he reaches a 
               small...

               INT. SUBMARINE STATEROOM - NIGHT

               Within, an incongruously proper young Englishman "reading" 
               an ancient set of Tarot cards.

                                     OLD MATLIN'S VOICE
                         His name was Trevor. Profesor Trevor --

                                     WHITMAN
                         -- Broom! Topside, now.

               TREVOR "BROOM" BRUTTENHOLM is a gaunt, olive-skinned man in 
               his late twenties. In his hands, a tarot deck. He turns the 
               cards face up: THE FOOL, THE MOON...

                                     WHITMAN
                         The sooner we're done, the better.

               Broom grabs a worn-down wooden box full of books and amulets. 
               It has a leather strap that allows him to carry it, much 
               like a carpenter's tool box.

                                     BROOM
                         This is an important mission, Sgt. 
                         Whitman. I hope you realize that.

                                     WHITMAN
                         Oh -- you don't wanna know what I 
                         think. Topside, now.

               He moves away. Broom takes a small box and a few amulets.

               Before exiting, he pauses and tensely turns the last TAROT 
               CARD: THE DEVIL.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT/EXT. SCOTLAND - TUNNEL - NIGHT

               Super: OCTOBER 9, 1944, SCOTLAND.

               It's raining like hell now. Soldiers move through a short 
               tunnel carved into the mountain.

               Whitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside 
               Broom.

                                     BROOM
                         Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I 
                         have a word??

                                     WHITMAN
                              (impatient)
                         What is it?

                                     BROOM
                         In private, if you don't mind...

               EXT. SCOTLAND CHAPEL REMAINS

               They enter the remains of a small chapel. Broom produces the 
               small box. It's full of rosaries.

                                     BROOM
                         Your men -- They'll need these --

               Whitman scowls and huffs. A life-sized wooden Christ 
               contemplates the scene from above.

                                     WHITMAN
                         You are a Catholic??

                                     BROOM
                         Amongst other things, yes -- but 
                         that's hardly the point.

               Whitman locks and loads an automatic.

               He moves away. Broom looks up to the wooden Christ: It has 
               no eyes.

               MATLIN hauls his tripod and gear and joins the troops on the 
               move. Broom catches up with Whitman.

               Reaching a slope, Matlin sets down his camera. Turning, he 
               sees lights.

               Drenched, Broom and Whitman look down upon an impressive 
               ROMANESQUE RUIN. Under worklights, dozens of NAZI SOLDIERS 
               swarm among thick stone walls and archways.

               A dozen German soldiers swiftly assemble a large steel

               Kroenen throws a switch: On the machine, dozens of gears

               Steam pistons thrust copper rails upright, lifting two mighty 
               metal rings, not unlike a gyroscope. Kroenen grunts and 
               signals for more floodlights to be turned on.

               EXT. BEHIND THE ALTAR - NIGHT

               The lights flood an ancient sacristy lined with eroded stone 
               saints. GRIGORY, tall and gaunt, stands naked, arms fully 
               extended.

                                     GRIGORY
                         No matter what happens to me, you 
                         must carry on with the work.

               ILSA, a severe, ageless Aryan beauty, reverentially drapes 
               an embroidered robe over his bony shoulders.

                         This will guide you back to me.

               He pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling.

                                     GRIGORY
                         I grant you everlasting life, youth 
                         and the power to serve me.

               He dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then 
               wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation 
               and a ritual.

               VON KRUPT, an acrid German General, wearing dark SCARLET 
               glasses and LEATHER GLOVES, appears. Looks at his pocket 
               watch. On the gold lid: a SWASTIKA.

               Grigory walks towards the machine, its colossal steel and 
               copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights.

               He strides alongside Grigory and Ilsa, who holds an umbrella 
               to shield her master from the pouring rain.

                         There will be no failure, General. I 
                         promised Herr Hitler a miracle. I'll 
                         deliver one.

               Kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box 
               containing a massive gold and copper MECHA-GLOVE.

               Grigory extends his hand so that KROENEN may fit him with 
               the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses.

               The Americans fan out, unseen.

               Broom and Whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid 
               a German foot patrol.

               Other GI's take up positions below a machine gun nest.

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT 

               Grigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind 
               him.

                         new eden will arise.

               He looks down at the machine and whispers --

               He flexes his fingers and in response --

               -- the two metal rings swing around the machine's central 
               axis. TCHINK!!! WHIRRR!!! STEAM escapes from the ducts and 
               pipes. An invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain 
               to swerve momentarily away from Grigory's body.

               Ilsa signals TWO NAZI SCIENTISTS standing at a control panel.

               One of them inserts a 20 inch SOLID GOLD CYLINDER into the 
               machine. Two openings remain vacant next to it.

               A blade of light opens in the air!

               Burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire.

               EXT. COSMIC SLIT - NIGHT

               The edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color; an ALIEN 
               GALAXY sparkles on the other side. Suddenly, a work light 
               tears loose and flies in.

               EXT. COSMIC SLIT - FROM THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

               The six-foot work light tumbles by the massive OGDRU JAHAD: 
               seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin.

               Within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie 
               slumbering. As the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens 
               a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another...

               Fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison.

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT  

               Grigory screams as his body rises. Veins swell in his neck, 
               his face distorted by ecstasy and pain.

               CLICK. Someone shoots a photograph.

               EXT. RUINS - IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT

               It's Matlin, snapping for all he's worth. Whitman pulls him 
               down and pulls out a large bayonet blade.

               Too late. One of the NAZI SCIENTIST has heard them.

               EXT. RUINS, IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT

               The Nazi SCIENTIST approaches. Pauses next to the box with 
               the GOLD CYLINDERS.

                         We have to stop them!!!

               EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

               Grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy.  
               Even the skeptical Von Krupt is in thrall.

               The NAZI SCIENTIST reaches for a second GOLD CYLINDER. But 
               something else lands next to him: A GRENADE!!!

               The explosion blows him to pieces. In a few seconds, the 
               squad of Allies storms the area.

               A hail of bullets cuts down a dozen Nazis. The Allies overrun 
               the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere.

               VON KRUPT shoots wildly, hitting Broom in the leg. But 
               Whitman's bullets rip into the old Nazi's chest.

               Leaving a trail of blood, Broom crawls to a dead G.I. and 
               grabs a grenade from his belt.

               TCHKKK!!! Kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel 
               bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers, 
               mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors. 
               The steel chops clean through their weapons.

               Broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator.

               CLICK-CLACK!! It wedges itself between two moving tie rods.

               Kroenen squeals and -- retracting his blades -- lunges after 
               it. The gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. As 
               his fingers reach the grenade, it EXPLODES!!!

               Kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where 
               two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect.

               Another rail plunges -- FFFFT!!, like a javelin -- into the 
               earth right next to MATLIN.

               Grigory's face is distorted, pulled like ectoplasmic taffy, 
               his body contorting and breaking. The cosmic portal suddenly 
               implodes! Nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal 
               glove, empty and smoking.

               As the Allies approach, the fighting rages on.

               Grigory and Ilsa are gone. And for now, so is Kroenen. 
               Embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails, 
               nothing more.

               Allied SOLDIERS penetrate the ruins. Matlin helps Broom up.

               rings of the smoking machine. Whitman approaches.

               Broom glances at a 13th century FRESCO depicting heaven and 
               hell.

               EXT. INSIDE CHURCH RUINS - NIGHT

               Still raining. A group of soldiers spreads out, using 
               flashlights to scour through the rubble. Every one of them 
               has a rosary hanging from the bayonet.

                         he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, 
                         clubbed, drowned and castrated.

                         That makes him more than a hundred --

               A rustling sound reaches their ears. Matlin readies a handgun 
               as Broom scans the walls with his flashlight. Something moves, 
               accompanied by a loud scrape.

               Matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling 
               statue. SCREEEECH!!!! A RED THING jumps into the air!! 
               Instinctively, Matlin shoots at it.

               The RED THING leaps from arch to arch, followed by a trail 
               of bullet hits. Whitman and other soldiers join them --

                         It's got a big stone -- in its hand --

                         I think that is its hand.

               Hissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone 
               saint.

               WHITMAN points his gun at the scarlet shape above. Broom 
               stops him from firing.

                                     BROOM
                         Wait --

               In deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden 
               eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna.

               Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket. 
               Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED 
               THING shrinks back.

               Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his 
               lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark 
               comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons 
               around it.

               The creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with 
               tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist. 
               Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the 
               chocolate.

                         that whammer!

               Whitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows 
               the RED THING climbing into Broom's arms.

               Broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers 
               snatch the candy. Broom smiles.

                                     BROOM
                         It's a boy. Just a baby boy.

               EXT. CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT

               The soldiers cluster around, curious to see it. Matlin 
               prepares his camera and directs them into a group shot. Broom 
               smiles like a proud new father and embraces the creature, 
               patting him gently. CLICK!!!

                         want to set the record straight before 
                         I go.

               Matlin finally pulls an old 8x10 from a battered portfolio. 
               He smiles, full of memories.

               In the thick of a snowstorm, THREE FIGURES climb the icy 
               steps of a massive rock formation.

               Super: BIRGAU PASS, MOLDAVIA, PRESENT DAY.

               EXT. HIGH MOUNTAINS (SET), EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

               The THREE FIGURES move through a narrow passage until they 
               reach a DEAD END.

               FIGURE 1 stops at a symbol carved in the rocky ground and 
               consults Grigory's LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The symbol matches an 
               illustration in the book.

               Before them, a thick wall of ice. Using a heavy steel hammer, 
               FIGURE 1 breaks through.

                         I will guide you no further.

               Figure 2 produces two small GOLD INGOTS. Hands one to the 
               guide. Keeps the other one.

               The Guide examines his pay greedily: engraved in it: a 
               SWASTIKA.

               A cathedral-like vault that could easily hold a stadium. 
               From an opening somewhere above, eerie blue light streams 
               down on a magnificent labyrinth.

               A few more fireflies speckle the air, winking on and off.

               INT. ICE CAVE - LABYRINTH - DAY

               The THREE FIGURES move past cyclopean statues guarding the 
               inhuman architecture. The humans are dwarfed by the monumental 
               scale of the walkways and ramparts.

               INT. ICE CAVE - CENTRAL LABYRINTH AREA - DAY

               At the center of the labyrinth the stone floor is covered in 
               grooves radiating from a shallow stone basin.

               FIGURE 3 uncovers his face: he's a PEASANT GUIDE.

               FIGURE 1 exchanges a meaningful look with FIGURE 2. FIGURE 1 
               throws two solid gold pieces at the feet of the Sherpa. On 
               them, an embossed SWASTIKA. After a greedy moment of thought, 
               the Peasant kneels to pick up the gold.

               TCHKK!!! A long, shiny blade pierces the Peasant's chest 
               from behind. He blinks twice and slumps forward.

               FIGURE 2 steps out from behind him, a long, bloody blade in 
               his hand.

               The figures uncover their faces. ILSA has not aged and 
               KROENEN, still wears the same tight gas mask. He cleans his 
               blade in the snow and takes back the gold.

               Ilsa watches the Sherpa's blood as it runs in a steaming 
               rivulet, tracing a glyph in the grooves and filling the basin.

               A FIGURE RISES FROM THE BLOOD. A naked human shape, haloed 
               by fireflies.

               Leaves stir on the pavement. All the stores are decorated 
               for Halloween. Two kids dressed as SKELETONS run in front of 
               Broom, carrying a JACK-O-LANTERN.

               Leaning on a cane, Broom exits the building and walks toward 
               a waiting black Mercedes. The DRIVER (Agent Lime) opens the 
               door.

               Broom pauses to buy a dozen BABY RUTH candy bars from a street 
               vendor.

               EXT. B.P.R.D. BUILDING COMPLEX - DAY

               On a wooded, new jersey hill, a low-slung, high-tech complex 
               rests at the edge of a bluff, its foundation fused with the 
               rock below.

               SUPER: BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE, NEWARK, 
               N.J.

               EXT. B.P.R.D. COMPLEX - GATE ENTRANCE - DAY

               A dolled-up MOD-STYLE moped stops at the massive gate. 
               Strapped to the luggage rack are two cheap suitcases. The 
               driver, a very wet YOUNG MAN named MYERS, touches an old 
               fashioned buzzer under a sign reading "WASTE MANAGEMENT"

               A crackling INTERCOM VOICE answers.

                                     INTERCOM VOICE
                         Yes?

                         Quantico.

               A beat, then -- WHIRRR!!! An EYEPIECE and an LCD screen 
               scanner pop out.

                         Look at the birdie, son.

               Myers looks into the eyepiece. On the screen, Myers' cornea 
               is scanned. TWO VIOLET FLASHES. His ID and badge numbers 
               appear. CLACK! The gate opens.

               EXT. UPHILL ROAD - THE MOPED - DAY

               The moped putt-putts towards the building in the distance.

               INT. B.P.R.D. LOBBY - DAY

               Seated at a dramatic circular desk is a solitary guard. Myers 
               approaches.

                                     MYERS
                         Hello, I'm --

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         -- Late. Five minutes late.

                                     MYERS
                         Yes, I --

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         -- Section fifty-one. Step back.

                                     MYERS
                         Pardon?

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         Two steps back, please.

               Confused, Myers picks up his suitcases and complies. He 
               realizes he's DEAD CENTER on a giant B.P.R.D. Logo: A HAND 
               HOLDING A SWORD.

                                     LOBBY GUARD
                         Watch your hands and elbows.

               Immediately, the floor under Myers' feet starts down. He's 
               on a small elevator.

               INT./EXT. OPEN ELEVATOR - ON THE WAY DOWN - DAY

               The panel overhead slides shut. A row of safety lights comes 
               on.

               INT. OPEN ELEVATOR - DAY

               He's in a vast underground area with other elevators moving 
               up and down in the distance.

               INT. B.P.R.D. - CONCRETE CHAMBER 51 - DUSK

               The elevator stops in a narrow, dark space. Neon lights 
               flicker on, illuminating a circular chamber. PAINTED on the 
               floor is a huge number: 51.

               Right in front of Myers: a magnificent oak door.

               Myers knocks on it. No answer. Myers enters.

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE (FULL AQUARIUM)- DUSK

               Myers looks around, fascinated: books. An office made of 
               them. The soft glow of green-shaded reading lamps bathes 
               everything in an intimate, warm light.

               One entire wall is a thick pane of glass, the wall of a huge 
               tank of water. A VOICE crackles through an intercom next to 
               the tank.

                                     VOICE
                         Turn the pages, please.

               Myers jumps, then moves closer to the glass.

                                     VOICE
                         Over here... if you don't mind?

               In the tank, ABE SAPIEN, a FISH-MAN glides in and out view.

                                     MYERS
                         Jesus Christ!

               Myers looks at four BOOK STANDS facing the glass. Each 
               supports an open volume. He leans close to the glass, peering 
               intently.

               Abe reappears. He is slender, dolphin gray, with dark patterns 
               streaking his soft skin. Bright blue eyes shine with 
               intelligence. Behind a thin wound-like mouth, gills are 
               bubbling.

                                     MYERS

                         These -- ? You're reading these -- ?

               Abe nods. Through a side door, Broom enters.

                         My name's Broom. Professor Trevor 
                         Broom.

               Myers extends his hand in greeting --

                                     MYERS
                         Sir, I'm --

               BAM! Abe presses his webbed hand against the glass, closes 
               his eyes -- all three lids.

               Abe's voice surges from the speaker.

                         away.

               Broom uncovers a tray by the tank: Four greenish eggs. Myers 
               gags and reels back.

               Abe smiles and takes a subaquatic bow, gracefully nabbing 
               the eggs as they float through the hatch.

                                     MYERS

               Myers and Broom walk down a corridor. The walls are lined 
               with glass cases containing occult artifacts. Myers eyes a 
               MUMMIFIED HAND, a CLAY GOLEM, a sumptuous PAGAN ALTAR...

               He points to an ANCIENT, BROKEN LANCE.

               Workmen are replacing two of the doors. Big dents from an

               They reach a FINAL DOOR. Stainless steel, like a BANK VAULT. 
               Waiting there is AGENT CLAY, a burly guy in a suit, with a

               Broom hands Myers two BABY RUTH bars and walks away.

               Clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless,

               On a sofa (made from the bed of a pickup truck) is a heap of

                         He never goes out unsupervised --

                         Who?!

               Clay points at a torn comic book: HELLBOY, THE UNCANNY. Myers 
               picks it up, looks at the cover: it shows Hellboy -- in a 
               U.S. Uniform, fighting a monstrous ape.

               Myers watches, amazed, as a bright red TAIL waves in and out 
               of a pool of light about ten feet away. One of the cats 
               playfully paws at it.

                                     MYERS

                         Yup. Sixty years old by our count.  
                         But he doesn't age like we do -- 
                         think dog years: He's barely out of 
                         his teens.

               Myers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows, 
               exercising with a 300 lb. Stainless steel DUMBBELL. Crimson 
               biceps like cooked hams. Chomping an unlit CIGAR stub.

                         got those implants??

               Agent Clay blushes as he hides his scalp.

                                     CLAY
                         It'll fill in. Where do you want 
                         your dinner, Red? By the couch?

               On a nearby pile of junked TV sets, a loop of Fleischer 
               cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. One subject appears 
               over and over: an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN with a pale face 
               and raven-black hair.

                         in the field.

               BANG!!! Hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. Instinctively, Myers 
               jumps.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I don't want him.

               Myers remembers he's holding the Baby Ruths.

               Hellboy finally enters the light. He's awe-inspiring, with 
               chiseled features, patterned red skin and deep-set golden 
               eyes. Involuntarily, Myers recoils.

               In spite of himself, Myers is staring at the horn stumps.

                                     HELLBOY

               An ALARM sounds, and a red light blinks on the wall. Myers 
               looks around, bewildered.

               An imposing four-story structure, all pillars and pediments. 
               A HALLOWEEN BANNER advertises: MAGICK: THE ANCIENT POWER.

               Super: THE MACHEN LIBRARY, MANHATTAN 

               Chaos near the entrance: policemen, TV reporters, MOUNTED 
               POLICE.

               Loud protests from the reporters as a line of black sedan 
               cars are waved through.

                                     BLONDE REPORTER
                         The NYPD has yet to issue a statement. 
                         We've got SWAT vans, paramedics, you 
                         name it...  and now here's -- a 
                         garbage truck --
                              (double take)
                         -- a garbage truck?

               Trailing behind the cars, a GARBAGE TRUCK. On its side a 
               mirrored sign reads: SQUEAKY CLEAN INC. Waste Management 
               Services.

               INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK - LIBRARY STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               AN AGENT is driving the truck, with MYERS at his side.

               EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY - STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               The crowd parts like the Red Sea for the garbage truck. Dozens 
               of faces are reflected in the truck's mirrored logo. A MOUNTED 
               POLICEMAN rides past the mirrored sides of the truck.

               INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - LIBRARY CROWD - NIGHT

               The MOUNTED POLICEMAN is visible as he rides by. The mirrors 
               are see-through. The back of the truck is a fully-equipped 
               crime lab, crammed with hi-tech gear and low-tech talismans.

               ABE fits a respirator over his face. It looks like a 
               mechanized Elizabethan collar. Valves bubble and hiss as he 
               inhales liquid through his mouth and out his gills. 

               Hellboy looks out onto the CROWD.

                         sheet of glass between them and us.

                         You mean, outside... with her.

               Hellboy straps on a huge utility belt heavy with amulets, 
               rosaries, horseshoes. From an ashtray he grabs a handful of 
               stogie stubs. Lights one, puts the rest in a pouch.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't get psychic with me.

                         Nothing psychic about it. You're 
                         easy.

               Hellboy unlocks a STEEL BOX (STENCILED ON ITS LID: "THE GOOD 
               SAMARITAN") and extracts the meanest-looking, custom-built, 
               double-barrel, blue-finished, handgun ever made. A veritable 
               cannon.

                         How am I ever gonna get a girl?? I

                         Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.

               EXT. COURTYARD / LOADING DOCK MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               The GARBAGE TRUCK pulls into an interior courtyard and stops.

               FBI/BPRD teams spread through the area, expelling uniformed 
               cops and securing the doors.

               THREE AGENTS -- QUARRY, STONE and MOSS -- close a gate, 
               sealing off the area.

                         coming in.

               The truck stops, Clay pulls a lever. Myers watches as the 
               dumpster loader hinges down like a drawbridge, revealing 
               HELLBOY and ABE.

                                     CLAY

                         locators.

               Abe, Clay and Hellboy activate lights on their belts. They 
               BEEP and blink. Hellboy starts walking.

               INT. MACHEN LIBRARY, MAIN LOBBY - NIGHT

               As BPRD agents clear the area, Clay, Myers, Abe and Hellboy 
               march through the main lobby. On view, various display cases. 
               Two BANNERS flank the marble staircase.

               Myers observes as the red Goliath sheepishly averts his gaze 
               from that of the fragile old man.

               INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT

               They approach an oversize set of brass doors.

               Abe removes a leather glove from his hand. FWAP!! he spreads 
               his webbed fingers on the door. He closes his three eyelids 
               and concentrates.

               Two agents arrive with a rolling munitions case. Myers 
               observes as Hellboy opens it and looks over a potpourri of 
               bullets of all colors and shapes.

                         Behind this door. A dark entity -- 
                         Evil, ancient and hungry.

               Abe quickly starts scanning a few leather-bound volumes of 
               ancient magic.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Oh, well. Lemme go in and say "hi".

               As HELLBOY opens the big doors, a flickering amber glow 
               illuminates him. He steps inside.

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT

               BLUE emergency lamps are on. The exhibits are destroyed; 
               piles of debris are burning. Hellboy walks past a fallen 
               display case.

               He moves around cautiously. A couple of large carvings and 
               statues startle him.

               On the floor: boots, half chewed. Bitten belts and shreds of 
               uniforms and hats.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (whispers into radio)
                         Blue: It stinks in here -- Finely 
                         aged roadkill.

               The sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches 
               his ears. Hellboy reacts to a smell, raises his eyes to 
               discover --

               A huge pale CREATURE hangs from the ceiling, chewing slowly. 
               SAMMAEL: equipped with powerful arms, a head full of tentacles 
               and two well-muscled hind legs. Most of its face is hidden, 
               but the jaws are shiny with blood.

                                     HELLBOY

               INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT

               Abe has found a small, medieval engraving of Sammael in one 
               of the books.

                                     ABE
                         There's not much here: the entity's 
                         name is Sammael, the desolate one, 
                         son of Nergal --

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT

               Sammael releases himself, lands on the floor. Part of the 
               neck is exposed: white, slimy skin, cracked like old marble 
               and criss- crossed with blue veins.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hold it --

                         Hey, Sammy, whaddayasay we work this 
                         out?? Peacefully. I'm not a great 
                         shot, but --
                              (raises his gun)
                         "The Samaritan" here, uses really 
                         big bullets, so whadyasay we work 
                         this out?

               Sammael stands and turns around -- CRACK-KKK!!! His waist 
               twists him 360 degrees!!

               Screeching, Sammael leaps away!!!

               Hellboy shoots. The high-caliber ammo rips a few columns 
               apart and finally catches Sammael. The bullet goes through 
               it and destroys a statue and a large window behind him. The 
               monster squeals and goes down. With a rattling cough, it 
               grows still.

               Hellboy turns away for a moment. Puts his gun away, like a 
               gunslinger.

                                     HELLBOY

               BAMMM!! From out of nowhere, Sammael appears and swings an 
               arm!! Hellboy CRASHES into the brass doors!

               INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - EXHIBIT CORRIDORS - NIGHT

               The doors bulge and crack under Hellboy's impact.

               Abe and Broom backpedal fast. Myers pulls out his gun, and 
               starts looking for another way in. Broom observes this, 
               pleased.

               INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - MAGIK EXHIBIT HALL - NIGHT

               Sammael lashes out with a massive punch.

               HELLBOY goes K-KKRASH!!! K-KKRASH!!! through SIX glass 
               cabinets, then hits a window, falling --

               EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               -- two stories down, landing sideways in an industrial garbage 
               bin. Hellboy fights to stay conscious. Blood drips from his 
               mouth

                                     GRIGORY'S VOICE
                         Child...

               Hellboy looks up: standing in the alley, like an apparition, 
               is Grigory, in a black suit and overcoat, his eyes shielded 
               by pitch-black sunglasses

                                     GRIGORY
                         All grown up, I see.

               Hellboy's in shock, confused.

                                     HELLBOY
                         That voice --

                         I sang the first lullaby you ever 
                         heard, my child. I ushered you into 
                         this world.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.

               Hellboy catches sight of his big gun, lying on the ground. 
               He goes for it but, BAMMM!!!! SAMMAEL lands before him.

                                     GRIGORY
                         I can see that you're still young 
                         and don't know your place.
                              (turns to Sammael)
                         Teach him.

               Before Hellboy can reach the weapon --

               WSHHHP!!! A 7-foot tongue lashes out from Sammael's mouth 
               like a whip. It's arm-thick, with yellow sacs billowing from 
               its sides. It wraps around Hellboy's right arm.

               Hellboy falls to the ground, writhing, grinding his teeth. 
               The tongue squeezes and pulls. Smoke pours from Hellboy's 
               skin.

               EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Then -- BANG! BANG! BANG! Myers appears at the end of the 
               alley, firing round after round into Sammael's tongue. AMBER 
               BLOOD explodes in the air. The tongue recoils with an infernal 
               SQUEAL!!

               Hellboy manages to roll away.

               Myers goes for HELLBOY's gun... and grabs it! He takes cover 
               behind the trash container. HELLBOY is there.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What do you think you're doing??

               Myers proudly shows him the gun.

                                     MYERS
                         Helping you -- I just --

                         No one ever helps me. It's my job.

               He grabs his gun and tries to reload, but his arm hurts too 
               much.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Damn -- Okay. Here --

               He hands him the gun and a fresh clip. Reaching into his 
               belt, Hellboy extracts a vacuum-sealed packet.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (throws it at Myers)
                         -- Then load this.

               In the packet: A SINGLE BULLET.

                                     HELLBOY
                         It's a tracking bullet. Crack the 
                         pin. Load it.

               KLANG!!! The tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod. 
               Again and again... Hellboy and Myers can barely dodge it.

               Myers cracks a safety pin. The glass head on the bullet glows 
               like a chemical flare.

                                     MYERS
                         Jeez... What the hell is that?

               He's looking at Hellboy's smoking arm. Inside a bloody gash, 
               a big, black stinger is gleaming.

               Hellboy pulls it out, then steps on it. It pops like a ripe 
               grape.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Lemme go ask --

               Hellboy steps from behind the container. Sammael's tongue 
               instantly wraps around the gun's muzzle.

               BAM! BAM! Hellboy shoots repeatedly. His face lit weirdly 
               green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun. Then -- 
               BAM!!!!

               INSIDE GUN SHOT

               The glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards --

               EXT. ALLEY

               -- Sammael, still in mid-air.

               It hits him square in the chest: an explosion of green goo!!

               With a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. Hellboy scrambles 
               after it.

               EXT. LOADING ALLEY - NIGHT

               On the empty sidewalk, Hellboy sees a trail of GLOWING GOOP.

               He hits full stride, following it around a corner. Myers 
               lands a second later, cradling his arm, chasing after him.

                                     MYERS
                         Wait! No, what are you doing?

               LOADING DOCK / ALLEY

               Sammael dashes by, followed closely by Hellboy, running full 
               tilt.

               A ten-wheeler backs up, effectively blocking their way. A 
               few workers load pumpkin boxes in it.

                                     WORKER 1
                         What the hell is that??

               Without slowing down, Sammael jumps onto the trailer, denting 
               the roof then jumping off and into a CROWDED CARNIVAL area.

               A small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch.

               Full of curiosity, Sammael pauses a second to inspect a Trick-
               or-treater dressed as a GOLDEN DRAGON.

               Hellboy catapults himself onto the trailer's roof.

                                     3 WORKERS
                              (chorus)
                         Whoa-whoa-whoa-

               Hellboy jumps and lands heavily on top of the driver's cab: 
               CRASH!!!

               The driver is almost crushed under the steel. He screams, 
               showered by thousands of glass shards.

               Myers is a few steps behind.

                         We're heading towards civilians...

               He squeezes between the vehicle and the alley wall. The 
               vendors are yelling at him.

                                     MYERS
                         Yeah, yeah, crazy costume, uh? Trick 
                         or treat!!

               EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

               Sammael runs past a group of trick-or-treaters, and jumps 
               straight into the street. Cars swerve, avoiding a collision 
               as Sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk. The TRICK OR 
               TREATERS scream.

               Hellboy appears. He too dives straight into the traffic as 
               Myers follows --

               He runs into the road... and a 4X4 speeds straight at him!

               Seeing this, Hellboy runs back, and lands next to Myers, 
               holds out his STONE HAND and stops the 4x4 dead in its tracks.

               The impact somersaults the car over them both. It lands with 
               a thud on the street, air bags exploding. Myers almost faints.

               Other cars stop, tires squealing and horns blaring. A major 
               traffic jam.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Are you okay?

               Myers opens his eyes, nods.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Good. Stay here.

               He moves after Sammael.

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               Hellboy follows the GLOWING GOOP into an adjacent alley. At 
               the far end he sees a metal grate has been moved. Sammael's 
               gone.

               He comes up to the opening, then jumps in.

               EXT./INT. STUNT TRACKS TUNNEL - NIGHT

               He lands on a subway track. Sammael is a few yards away. 
               Seated.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Waiting for me, Sammy?

               A train horn blares. A headlight approaches!! Hellboy smiles 
               and puts away his gun.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Uh-oh -- between a rock and a hard 
                         place --

               But Sammael sprints towards it!

                                     HELLBOY
                         Aw, crap --

               Sammael unhinges a long, scythe-like bone from his forearm, 
               then jumps at the front car --

               OMIT

               INT. STUNT TRACKS / FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT

               smashing through glass and steel and raining sparks. Landing 
               inside with a ROAR!!! --

               EXT./INT. THE SUBWAY - 2 TRAIN CAR SET - NIGHT

               SAMMAEL's tongue punches through the doors as he races through 
               one -- two -- passenger cars and out the --

               STUNT TRACK REAR 1/4 CAR

               -- rear of the train, back onto the tracks.

               INT. STUNT  TRACKS - NIGHT

               Landing there safely.

               INT. THE SUBWAY TRACKS (STUNT TRACK) - NIGHT

               Now the train hurtles at Hellboy, who grimaces and does his 
               best --

               INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR

               He leaps, but HUMPF!! He's hit! His legs rattle over the 
               tracks.

               INT. UNDERCARRIAGE - STUNT TRACKS - FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT

               Inches from the wheels, he punches his stone hand through 
               the steel floor and grabs a handhold. Steam and sparks explode 
               everywhere.

               The TRAIN DRIVER grabs a fire extinguisher and starts slamming 
               it against Hellboy's head.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hey! Hey! I'm on your side!!

               BAMMM!!! He goes under!!!

               INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR

               The train whizzes overhead, grazing his horn stumps, making 
               sparks fly!! After the train passes, Hellboy sits up, forehead 
               smoking. Sammael is gone. A trail of GOOP is glowing. He 
               follows it, until it ends abruptly.

               He looks ahead: no trace of Sammael... Then a fat drop of 
               glowing goop hits his hand.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Aw, I forgot --

               He looks up. Sammael hangs from the ceiling, then drops. 
               Then the creature lifts Hellboy in a ferocious bear hug.

               Hellboy twists around and cracks open the jaws of the 
               creature, like King Kong and the T-Rex.

               Sammael staggers back and -- in an impossible maneuver, re-
               knits his jaws together! Then he uses his bone scythe to 
               tackle Hellboy and -- TCHAKKKK!! -- pin his shoulder down. A 
               deep wound.

               Sammael's mouth starts to open! Hellboy looks at the sparking 
               THIRD RAIL a few feet away.

               Sammael's tongue rears back, a snake ready to strike.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Screw you.

               Hellboy grabs the rail. An electrical discharge consumes 
               both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper. Hellboy 
               lets go, his hand and body smoking. Sammael -- very crispy -- 
               is convulsing in a cloud of smoke. He grows still.

               Wreathed in smoke, Hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a 
               flame on his arm to light a cigar.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I'm fireproof.

               A huge traffic jam clogs the highway. The totalled 4X4 is 
               being TOWED AWAY. Several TV CREWS interview witnesses.

               Myers -- his arm freshly bandaged -- signs a police form. 
               His radio beeps.

                                     HELLBOY (V.O.)

               He turns off his belt locator and moves away into the darkness 
               of the tunnel.

               In the foreground: BLACK light escapes from Sammael's charred 
               body.

               INT. MAIN ABANDONED BATHS ALCOVE - NIGHT

               An abandoned shower room. A series of sinks and stalls, lined 
               with dirty white tile. A phonograph nearby plays Wagner. 
               Kroenen stands next to it.

               ILSA is nearby, a straight razor glinting in her hand. She 
               stands over Grigory -- his back to us -- lovingly shaving 
               her master's scalp. She grabs two GLASS EYES from a table. 
               Places them in Grigory's sockets -- his back to us -- as he 
               turns, a glass eye shifts lazily into position. He opens his 
               hand: in it the pale BLACK light that escaped from Sammael's 
               body. He cradles it like a precious stone.

                                     GRIGORY
                              (smiling)
                         Sammael has fulfilled his destiny... 
                         Die in peace and be reborn again and 
                         again...

               He closes his fist.

                         Only seven more days to the eclipse,

               Rasputin stands, his neck and shoulders rising, engorged by 
               moving flesh beneath his human skin. Ilsa stares in 
               fascination.

               Behind him, in the darkness of a tunnel: TWO SAMMAEL 
               silhouettes appear.

               A sleek black limo drives past the crowd and stops outside. 
               FBI agent TOM MANNING emerges.

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - NIGHT

               Manning and Broom walk through the mess. A crew is cleaning 
               up. The dead guards are carried out.

                         is, "The Brady Bunch?" These... freaks --

               ABE SAPIEN listens while pacing the exhibition hall, palm 
               open.

                              tense)
                         These freaks, Trevor, they give me 
                         the creeps. And I'm not the only 
                         one. You're up for review. You and 
                         your petting zoo.

               Manning watches as Abe finds a sharp dagger embedded in the 
               floor.

               Abe holds the dagger in his hand, turns to Broom.

                         You mind sharing your mystic insights?

               Broom examines the dagger: a RAGNAROK symbol crowns the hilt.

               INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - FLASHBACK

               Hours earlier: the place is intact. Both ABE and BROOM witness 
               spectrally as --

               A GUARD CHECKS AN ALARM MONITORING UNIT. HEARING A ticking 
               sound, he shines his light into a dark corner: no one's there. 
               But after the guard moves on, a spidery form emerges from 
               the pool of shadows on the floor.

               It's KROENEN, encased in shiny BLACK LATEX from head to toe. 
               On his chest, a close-fitting harness comprised of softly 
               ticking gears.

               He approaches a glass case which holds an ancient WOODEN 
               STATUE of an Eastern Orthodox SAINT.

               Then, on the glass, a reflection: ILSA.

                                     ILSA
                         Move.

               She uses her hammer to destroy the glass case.

               The ALARM shrieks. Warning lights come on.

               Kroenen pulls out a double-ended BLADE. It spins, like a 
               giant bone saw, slicing across the statue.

               No apparent damage until: CRACKKKKK!!! a diagonal line appears 
               and the top half falls.

               KROENEN reaches for a small crank embedded in his chest and 
               winds himself up.

               Ilsa reaches into a hollow portion in the wooden statue and 
               removes a large reliquary jar containing Golden sand.

               Six guards hurry in. They point their flashlights and guns 
               at Kroenen.

                                     GUARD 1
                         You! Don't move! Hands up!

               Kroenen starts shaking, as if in a seizure and readies two 
               TWIN BLADES.

               bullet tears into Kroenen's arm, spewing forth an explosion 
               of dust. He turns. The guards shoot again. Kroenen maneuvers 
               the steel, deflecting the bullets which --

               -- ricochet wildly -- and finally hit three of the guards. 
               They fall silently to the floor.

               Kroenen dispatches two more in a flurry of knives.

               The last guard raises his gun.

                                     GUARD 6
                         Don't --

               Something is clearly stopping him. His hand breaks, twisted 
               by an unseen force!!

               The flesh on his neck pushes upwards, held by an invisible 
               force. He starts floating in mid-air.

               The blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows 
               red and amber. They outline a figure formerly submerged in 
               shadows. GRIGORY. He gestures with both hands, as if holding 
               an imaginary doll.

               His arm muscles twitch under his skin, shifting, changing, 
               gaining strength.

               With a quick gesture Grigory twists the lower and upper parts 
               of the guard's body in opposite directions.

               With a wet CRUNCH, the guard's shadow on the wall goes limp. 
               Grigory looks at Ilsa.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Ready the welcome, my love --

               Ilsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto 
               the floor.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Salt. Gathered from the tears of a 
                         thousand martyrs. Restraining the 
                         essence of Sammael, the hell hound, 
                         the seed of destruction.

               Grigory slices the air with his open hand, creating fleeting 
               glyphs... and a small BLACK flame dances on his open palm. 
               He deposits it in mid-air, at the center of the circle.

               Then, the sand begins to move, like liquid mercury. Lines 
               fuse into a pile. It melts and bubbles, growing and foaming. 
               Bones are formed, tendons and ligaments join together, 
               GROWING, GROWING, INTO SAMMAEL.

               It roars!!!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Abe snaps out of it. Broom is pale. He steps away, wincing, 
               enduring a bolt of pain in his side. Abe holds him. Motions 
               for the others to stay back.

               He extends his open palm and "feels" the air near the old 
               man's back.

                                     ABE

               Broom turns around, gently pushes Abe's hand away.

                                     BROOM
                         Sixty years ago Abe, they tried to 
                         destroy the world. And they are back -- 
                         in my lifetime, they are back. To 
                         finish the job.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

               A small nighttime Halloween celebration. Lanterns hanging 
               from the trees, couples drinking and listening to Pop music 
               on picnic tables.

               On a bench, A YOUNG GUY pulls out a cold SIX PACK of beer 
               and passionately kisses his GIRLFRIEND. As he shuts his eyes, 
               a bright, red tail neatly snatches the six-pack.

               Behind the bench, HELLBOY smiles.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

               Dry leaves fly up in a gust of wind. A small army of EMERGENCY 
               VEHICLES roars down the deserted streets, right past a...

               ...brick 1940's HOSPITAL, behind a high wall topped with 
               barbed wire. The mesh-covered windows are decorated with 
               paper skeletons and jack-o'-lanterns. A topiary garden 
               surrounds the building.

               Watching from atop the wall is HELLBOY. One sleeve of his 
               overcoat is soaked in blood. He keeps an eye on the SECOND 
               FLOOR windows. Hanging from his tail: THE SIX PACK OF BEER.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               DOCTOR MARSH, a female psychiatrist, moves down a line 
               patients, distributing pills.

               Behind her, a lithe young woman in a patient's gown carries 
               the medicine tray. This is LIZ SHERMAN, age 26, her pale 
               skin contrasting with her raven-black hair and piercing dark 
               eyes. A scar mars her forehead. Three thick rubber bands 
               circle her wrist.

               Near a window, a Down's Syndrome PATIENT senses something.

                                     DOWN'S PATIENT
                              (pointing)
                         There's a big red guy down there!

                                     DOCTOR MARSH
                              (readying more pills)
                         That's fine, darling, Santa's not 
                         here for another month.

                                     DOWN'S PATIENT
                         Not Santa. Big and red. With gold 
                         eyes. And he has beer!

               Hearing this, Liz stops. She closes her eyes, tugs at one of 
               the rubber bands on her wrist and lets it snap against her 
               skin. She winces and peers out the window. The garden below 
               seems empty.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA - NIGHT

               Liz steps out a side door into the hospital garden. Hanging 
               from her neck: an old POLAROID CAMERA. She follows a trail 
               of blood to a large, thorny bush. As she circles it...

                                     LIZ
                         Back so soon?

               Visible in the branches, a leg and part of Hellboy's overcoat. 
               His tail emerges, dangling the six-pack.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Uh, I brought beer.

               Liz shoots a Polaroid.

                                     LIZ
                         To wash down my lithium pills?
                              (beat)
                         I may get a few perks, H.B. But I'm 
                         still a patient.

               Shyly, he climbs out from the bush. She sees the bloody arm.

                                     LIZ
                         You better have that looked at.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Just a scratch.
                              (shrug)
                         I wanted to see you.

               Liz sighs.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA- NIGHT

               Hellboy's sitting on a bench, next to Liz.

                                     HELLBOY
                         We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's 
                         crazier every day. And Father's still 
                         mad at me --
                              (Liz smiles)
                         Come back, Liz. Come back. I --

                                     LIZ
                         No. Not this time, H.B. It's been 
                         months since I've had an episode. 
                         And you know what? I'm learning to 
                         control it.

               Around her right hand a faint BLUE AURA of fire blooms, 
               crawling over her fingers like a velvet haze. She stares at 
               the pale flame.

                                     LIZ
                         I'm learning where it comes from.
                              (beat)
                         And for once in my life I'm not 
                         afraid.

               She clenches her fist and puts the flame out.

                                     LIZ
                         Looks like your ride is here.

               The garbage truck and the two black sedan cars have pulled 
               into the hospital grounds. A dozen agents climb out of the 
               vehicles.

                                     HELLBOY
                         The Nanny Squad.

               ANGLE - THE CARS - CONTINUOUS

               Clay starts towards Hellboy, but Myers stops him and turns 
               to Broom:

                                     MYERS
                         Sir, may I go first??

                              (to Broom)
                         Not so fast. He barely knows him --

                                     BROOM
                              (cuts him off)
                         Then he should make it his business 
                         to change that.

               ANGLE - THE BENCH - CONTINUOUS

               Liz stands up, puts her hand on his shoulder.

                                     LIZ
                         Listen, H.B. I've got a chance out 
                         here. If you truly care about me, 
                         don't come back anymore.

               Hellboy smiles sadly. She walks away.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Goodnight, then.

                                     LIZ
                         Goodnight.

               She doesn't turn back.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Yeah, I gotta go, too. Lots to do --

               Feeling light-headed, he stands up. On the bench and at his 
               feet, a pool of his own blood.

               He sees Myers tentatively approaching.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What took you so long?

                                     MYERS
                         C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.

                                     HELLBOY
                         What are you, a Boy Scout?

                                     MYERS
                         No. I never was.

                                     HELLBOY

                         Could've fooled me. Go away.

               Hellboy drops to his knees. Clay, Quarry and Moss reach him. 
               Help him up.

                                     CLAY
                         C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, 
                         there.

                                     HELLBOY
                         This -- ? This is nothing. You know 
                         what'll kill me?
                              (points at the doorway)
                         Her.

               Liz stands at the hospital door and sees Hellboy keel over. 
               A few of the agents help him to the vehicles.

               Myers looks back at Liz. They hold each others' gaze, their 
               unfamiliar faces filled with curiosity. Eventually, she goes 
               inside.

               INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY "A" - NIGHT

               In the depths of the B.P.R.D infirmary, Hellboy lies flat on 
               a stainless steel table. Broom sits alongside him.

               Abe peers through a magnifier at Hellboy's wounded arm.

                         Is it bad?

               Broom comes closer, eyes wide: inside the wound on Hellboy's 
               forearm, nestled like ticks, are 3 translucent EGGS.

               Hellboy jumps as Abe plucks the first one out. Abe deposits 
               it in a glass container.

               INT. MEDICAL BAY. EXAMINATION TABLE - LATER

               The computer beeps having finished an analysis. On a monitor, 
               an enlarged color image of one of the throbbing eggs.

                         The eggs are very sensitive to heat 
                         and light. They need a humid, dark 
                         environment to breed.

               Abe picks up an egg with a pair of tweezers, passes it on to 
               Hellboy, who sports a bandage on his arm.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Well, let's see -- there was that 
                         moment, when I had a train on top of 
                         my head --

               Broom frowns, worried.

                         agents, search the area, top to 
                         bottom.

               Myers observes, repelled, as inside the egg a small foetal 
               THING wiggles.

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Myers stands by Broom's desk as the old man places a new set 
               of books on the reading stands in front of the fish tank.

                         You're doing fine.

               At the last book stand, Broom glances at Abe, who is sitting 
               in the shadows near the door.

                                     MYERS
                         No, I'm not. He respects Clay. Not 
                         me. I don't know why you chose me, 
                         Sir. But I'm not qualified.

               Discouraged, Myers heads for the door.

               Shocked, Myers looks over at Broom.

                         And as a father, I worry about him.

               Dozens of HELLBOY clippings flash by: tabloid headlines along 
               with intimate images of Hellboy as a KID. H.B. at 7, at 12, 
               dressed as a human for Halloween, Broom by his side.

               Myers works at a computer workstation.

               He brings up a small photograph in an old issue of The 
               Enquirer. The headline: "ARSON SUSPECT NOW WORKING FOR SECRET 
               GOVERNMENT AGENCY" There's a photo of a woman, taken with a 
               telephoto lens.

               Another clipping: young LIZ, 11, and a photo of a tenement 
               building burned to the ground: TRAGIC EXPLOSION.

               A QUICKTIME interview pops up. LIZ, in her early twenties. A 
               caption reads: ELIZABETH SHERMAN, first interview, BPRD, 
               PYROKINETIC. She has a POLAROID camera in her hands. Shoots 
               one at the lens.

                         I don't like the term "firestarter." 
                         I just don't. And "Pyrokinesis" sounds 
                         like psychosis or something. I dunno -- 
                         maybe that's right. Not being able

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Two strolling ORDERLIES shine their flashlights inside the 
               rooms on both sides of a long corridor.

               INT. HOSPITAL - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SECURITY WARD - NIGHT

               A flashlight beam sweeps Liz's room. It illuminates a 
               CORKBOARD covered with hundreds of Polaroids depicting scenes 
               of everyday life.

               When the beam of light crosses her face, she turns slowly, 
               still asleep.

               As the light fades, the shadows in the room grow deeper. 
               Grigory emerges from a dark corner. He gazes down on the 
               bed, extending his right hand.

                                     GRIGORY
                         The Master is calling your name now, 
                         my girl. We are all part of his plan. 
                         You must return to the child... So, 
                         once again...

               He gently caresses the scar on her forehead. Under his skin, 
               a hideous movement, a writhing rearrangement of muscles. His 
               fingers start to glow.

                                     GRIGORY
                         ...dream of fire.

               Liz convulses. A small ripple of heat rises from her forehead.

                                                             FLASH BACK TO:

               EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING COURTYARD - DAY

               Somewhere in a smokestack city, grown-ups and kids hang 
               banners and prepare a ragged birthday party in a cement 
               courtyard.

               ANGLE - LIZ - CONTINUOUS

               Sitting on some tenement steps, LIZ, age 11. Sullen, alone, 
               a gold CRUCIFIX hanging on her chest.

               A WOMAN -- Liz's MOTHER -- comes down the courtyard steps, 
               carrying a basket of apples.

                                     MOTHER
                              (to Liz)
                         Liz!! Liz!! Come on, darling, give 
                         Mummy a hand.

               Nearby, under a balloon archway, munching candy-coated 
               apples... three KIDS giggle and point at her.

                                     BLONDE KID
                         Freak!

               Liz turns to see them.

                                     BLONDE KID
                              (to his friend)
                         See? She knows her name.

               Liz shies away from them.

                                     BLONDE KID
                         Go home, you freak. We don't want 
                         you here.

               They start throwing stones. One hits the steps. Another misses 
               her by inches. A third hits her in the shoulder.

               Scared, Liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face. 
               She falls down, blood trickling from her forehead, splattering 
               the pavement. She starts sobbing. Another rock sails across, 
               but this time, in mid-air, it catches fire and turns to ash.

               A ripple of heat starts crawling up Liz's hands. Soon a pale 
               blue flame rings her entire arm.

                                     LIZ
                              (sobbing)
                         Not again, please, not again...

               Firelight glints off the crucifix.

               EXT. TENEMENT COURTYARD - DAY

               MOTHER is dunking the apples in a pot of caramel. A 
               heartbreaking cry reaches her ears.

                                     LIZ
                         Mommy! Mommy!

               Mother sees...

               EXT. TENEMENT COURTYARD - STEPS -  DAY

               Liz: outlined by licking flames!

                                     LIZ
                              (panicked)
                         Mommy! Help me! I'm burning!

               Mother screams, horrified.

                                     LIZ
                         Help meee!!!

               She then explodes. A white-hot supernova engulfs the 
               courtyard. Her mother's body burns like flash paper. Then 
               the rest of the people are --

               THE ENTIRE TENEMENT COURTYARD

               -- devoured by an explosion of atomic proportions. Benches, 
               people, trees. Everything. The four surrounding apartment 
               blocks collapse as a shock wave hits like a wrecking ball.

               The frame whites out. And at ground zero there is but one 
               figure left standing:

               Liz... a little girl, still crying.

                                                          FLASH FORWARD TO:

               Liz screams, her back arching, her body now in flames. Her 
               chest glows, silhouetting organs and ribs.

               The rubber bands on her wrist vaporize.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT

               The glow from Liz's room streams into the corridor.

               In their glass kiosk, two ORDERLIES are listening to the 
               radio and sharing a pizza. A red light flashes repeatedly on 
               a panel.

               They silence the radio, grab their batons and get up. A low 
               rumble shakes the room.

               Through the VIBRATING glass window they see...

               CORRIDOR MINIATURE / COMPOSITE

               ...A BALL OF FLAME pushing inexorably through the corridor. 
               The inside of the glass booth is absolutely silent, making 
               the vision both terrifying and strangely serene.

               As the glass explodes, the fire ROARS, drowning everything. 
               The orderlies hit the floor, taking cover under a shelf.

               EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL (MINIATURE) - NIGHT

               The top floor blows up. Flame pours out of every window, 
               showering glass into the streets below.

               He opens the door to Hellboy´s den.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DAY

               Inside, Hellboy is leaning over Broom, glaring at the old 
               man.

                         That's not how she feels. She may 
                         never feel it.

               Myers enters, deliberately clearing his throat. They ignore 
               him.

               Broom grows silent.

               Hellboy stomps over to a mirror and -- using a hand-held 
               belt sander -- savagely shaves his horns. Sparks fly every 
               time he goes at the round stumps.

               Part of the building is demolished. Repair crews and firemen 
               are still hosing down smoldering piles of debris.

               Myers arrives in a taxi cab.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MAX. SECURITY WING - DAY

               Myers looks at LIZ through a see-through mirror. She sits on 
               a bench inside a padded cell. A security CAMERA AND MONITOR 
               records her constantly.

               A worried-looking Dr. Marsh stands alongside him.

                                     DOCTOR MARSH
                         She's been like this since it 
                         happened. There were no casualties. 
                         But it's put a big dent in our 
                         Thorazine supply...
                              (dubious look at Myers)
                         Are you sure you want to go in?

               Myers nods, loosens his tie and enters.

               INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - PADDED CELL - DAY

               Liz doesn't acknowledge Myers' presence. He kneels and looks 
               up at her.

               An explosion of sound and light as a subway train passes 
               through a dank tunnel. Then, light beams sweep the encrusted 
               walls and steel columns.

               Clay and some B.P.R.D. agents hold flashlights. Two of them -- 
               MOSS and QUARRY -- carry FLAMETHROWERS.

               Hellboy and Abe bring up the rear.

               INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY

               They enter a store room piled high with filing cabinets, 
               typewriters and school desks. A turn-of-the-century mural 
               depicts happy boys doing charitable acts. A Latin phrase 
               ("VIRILITER AGE") encourages them to behave like men.

                         orphanage. Closed since they moved 
                         the sewers in '51.

               Abe removes his gloves, hyperextends his palm and senses the 
               air. Then the surface of the water.

                                     ABE

               BAMMM!!! Hellboy's stone hand cracks the concrete. He starts 
               pounding, again and again, like a jack hammer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Makeshift living quarters tucked below a maze of furnace 
               ducts. Scores of old clocks fill the room with TICKING.

               At a desk, Kroenen calmly repairs a mechanical hand: his 
               own.

               His face is partly exposed. Under his leather mask, horrible 
               lidless eyes glitter over a skull-like grin, made of raw 
               gums and taut skin.

               As Hellboy's pounding reaches his ears, he rises, like a 
               spider whose web has twitched. The mechanical hand rattles 
               blindly on the table.

               He opens an ancient leather folder and extracts an engraving 
               depicting Sammael. Carefully places it on the table. Then he 
               opens a drawer and, from an envelope, takes two torn pieces 
               of paper. He puts them in a pouch in his belt.

               INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY

               The wall collapses under Hellboy's attack.

               Abe studies it, senses something, and nods. With superhuman 
               effort, Hellboy lifts it. Hundreds of roaches pour out.

                                     ABE
                         I'm glad I'm not human. This place

               Abe pulls off his breathing apparatus. Activates the locator 
               on his utility belt. Hellboy does likewise. BEEEP! The devices 
               synchronize.

               Hellboy extends a metal reliquary containing a small bone.

                                     HELLBOY

                         Dionysius. Ugh. Looks like a pinky.

               Abe ties the reliquary around his hand.

               As transparent nictomembrane lids cover his eyes, Abe dives.

               INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 - (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY

               Underwater, ABE finds an entire control room. 1940's magazines 
               float by, like paper jellyfish. The amber light of the 
               chemical flares gives the room an eerie other-worldly feel.

               INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

               Waiting above, Hellboy chews a Baby Ruth and pokes around. 
               Finds a pile of children's shoes covering some yellowing 
               albums. In the albums, a myriad of sad faces, the orphans 
               from the past.

               Some of the faces have been cut out. There's an unfinished 
               letter to Father Christmas, dated 1866.

               Clay stands below a grate, admiring his hair implants with a

               Suddenly, something moves. Hellboy shines his light into an 
               adjoining tunnel. Kroenen is standing there, like a deer 
               caught in headlights.

                                     HELLBOY

               INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY

               Clay arrives at an intersection of sewer tunnels. The glow 
               of Hellboy's flashlight is visible somewhere ahead, his 
               booming footsteps rapidly receding. A veritable labyrinth.

               Abe nears the bottom of the cistern. As his feet touch bottom, 
               a cloud of silt fogs the water. He picks out a translucent 
               egg!

               Suddenly, something big glides by. Abe turns: sees nothing.

               He places the egg in a glass canister. Now eggs are floating 
               everywhere, undulating in the water like amber fireflies. 
               Abe swims slowly, collecting them one by one.

               Some of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines.

               Abe's reliquary gets caught in a lever and snaps loose!! It 
               lands --

               on a grate on the floor. Abe swims down and tries to grab 
               it, but it falls through. Abe curses and stands up --

               -- only to find himself FACE TO FACE with Sammael!!

               The monster rakes Abe across the chest; dark blue blood begins 
               to flow. Abe shoves himself into a long, concrete fissure.

               Sammael can't fit through, but the tongue darts out, missing 
               Abe by inches. Sammael scratches at the walls, trying to 
               reach deeper, screaming in rage.

               Abe screams too, emitting a trail of bubbles.

               INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM - DAY

               The bubbles burst on the surface. Watching them is a SECOND 
               SAMMAEL.

               INT. INTERSECTION (LOCATION /BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) - DAY

               Hellboy stops, disoriented. No trace of KROENEN. He sniffs 
               the air, then steps through a non-descript portal.

               INT. (LOCATION/BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY

               Hellboy stands in Kroenen's quarters. An array of gas masks 
               dangle from ducts overhead. Glued next to the walls are dozens 
               of old photos of children.

               He discovers the Sammael engraving.

                                     HELLBOY
                         "Sammael: seed of destruction. Death 
                         becomes the fertile ground."

               Suddenly: drool drops from above: Sammael hangs from a beam.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (turning)
                         Didn't I kill you already?

               Sammael lunges, hurling Hellboy through an open service 
               shaft...

               ...and it's a long way down.

               When Sammael leaps, Hellboy throws him over the edge. Sammael, 
               however, grabs Hellboy's tail and pulls him over the side.

               A subway platform. Full of people.

               The two fighting creatures land on the ticket booth -- in an 
               explosion of coins, glass and steel!!! Some bold New Yorker 
               in the crowd start picking up handfuls of change.

               The dust clears, revealing a large crater in the platform 
               floor.

               Sammael hits Hellboy. The Red Giant lands on a line of 
               turnstiles, uprooting them all.

               Sammael flies through the air, unfolds its bone scythe. 
               Hellboy rolls away. Sammael misses: the tip imbeds itself in 
               the floor and then -- TCHAKKK!!! -- in a concrete column. 
               Sammael pulls, bringing down part of the ceiling. More SCREAMS 
               from the fleeing public.

               A mezzanine above Hellboy collapses, bringing the ceiling, 
               steel cables and office furniture down onto the Red Giant.

               Sammael takes a step towards the crowd and roars --

               Then, BAMMMMMM!!! A desk flies up into the air. Hellboy's 
               stone hand emerges, triumphant.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hey, Chunk-face!

               He climbs out of the crater. Sammael growls.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You can do better than that. Big 
                         monster like you.

               Hellboy rips off one of the turnstile bars and hits Sammael 
               again and again.

                                     HELLBOY
                         See? It hurts! You shouldn't hit 
                         people!

               Sammael blocks the last hit and throws the bar away. It embeds 
               itself in the tile wall.

               Sammael punches Hellboy, a hard uppercut.

               Hellboy flies up, crashing through the plate glass of a second  
               mezzanine above the platform. He skids on the tile floor, 
               scraping a jagged line with his stone hand.

               He slides past a group of BYSTANDERS and into a row of backlit 
               subway ads. He lands in a shower of glass and debris on a 
               wooden bench, breaking it in two.

               Sammael climbs up into the mezzanine.

               Hellboy gets up -- his back bristling with glass shards -- 
               and hears a WAIL: a YOUNG GIRL is pointing at A BOX OF KITTENS 
               abandoned on a bench.

                                     YOUND GIRL
                         My kittens!! My kittens!!!

                                     HELLBOY
                         Aw, crap.

               Sammael charges!!! Hellboy scoops up the box, holds it high!! 
               Using his bone blade, Sammael pulverizes the bench.

               Next, Sammael slashes at Hellboy, scattering a dozen shrieking 
               citizens.

               Illuminated by sparks and shorting lamps, Hellboy advances, 
               blood dripping from his forehead and nose.

               Hellboy starts to reload, but -- Sammael's tongue shoots 
               out. Hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and -- traps 
               the tongue with his stone hand --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Second date. No tongue!!

               -- while catching the box with his tail. The kittens are 
               fine.

               Using the tongue, he throws Sammael out a glass window.

               Sammael dangles above the tracks, but he re-joints himself 
               and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel. 
               From here, he pulls on Hellboy, sliding him toward the jagged 
               glass.

               Sammael pulls harder, enters the tunnel.

               Hellboy fights to free himself, but his sweaty face is 
               millimeters away from being sliced by the glass. All seems 
               lost, when...

               WHAAAAA!!!!!! A train appears out of nowhere heading straight 
               for Sammael.

               It splatters the thing against the tunnel wall and plows on. 
               Sammael's body sprawls motionless at the side of the tracks.

               Hellboy approaches Sammael, whose remains are wreathed in 
               BLACK flame. A huge CROWD looks on from the end of the 
               platform.

                                     HELLBOY

               He moves away. The BLACK flame flickers out.

               INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY

               Under the water, BLACK light blooms within TWO OF SAMMAEL'S 
               EGGS as a fantastic methamorphosis starts. The embryos burst 
               out, gyrating in the water, swelling and distending.

               INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY

               Badly wounded, Abe peers from his hiding spot. Sammael's not 
               there.

               He quickly swims to the surface, his weird blue blood trailing 
               behind him. The water boils with energy and BLACK LIGHT. 

               INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

               Abe staggers out of the pool and hides behind a crumbling 
               shower stall. Behind him, two SHAPES come to the surface.

               Shaking, Abe pushes his belt locator and collapses.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Abe -- ?

               INT. BEAM-SUPPORTED UNDERGROUND TUNNEL/ STORAGE ROOM - DAY

               Back in the tunnel, Quarry and moss move filing cabinets and 
               rotten bozes full of files. One of them gives out and papers 
               spill all over.

                                     MOSS
                         Jesus --

               Their locators light up.

                                     QUARRY
                         Abe --

               Suddenly -- a noise! The agents leap up and sweep their 
               flashlights over the columns... Nothing there.

                                     QUARRY
                         Moss, what the hell was that?

               Then, TWO SILHOUETTES cast long shadows. Powerful footfalls 
               boom like thunderclaps.

               Agent Quarry raises his gun and fires at the dark shapes. 
               Useless: the things plow on.

               Moss hurriedly straps on his flame thrower. After a few 
               seconds, a green light beeps, READY.

               The muzzle of the flamethrower vomits a 30 feet long gout of  
               fire into the blackness.

               The men pause: silence!

               Quarry turns on his flashlight, hand trembling.

                                     QUARRY
                         Whatever it was --

               BAM!!! SAMMAEL'S TONGUE uncurls from the shadows and lands 
               on Quarry's face, pulling him into the dark. His flashlight 
               bobbles and strobes, lighting up a nightmare:

               TWO SAMMAELS stand in the tunnel. One of them gleefully 
               squeezes Quarry. The man's screams are muffled by the 
               creature's fleshy lips wrapping around his head.

               Moss runs as fast as he can, jumping and tumbling through an 
               obstacle course of beams. Turning, he readies the 
               flamethrower. The SECOND SAMMAEL lands on Moss's back, 
               breaking his spine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Hellboy enters to find Abe, bleeding but alive, leaning 
               against the tile, blue blood all around him. Hellboy tries 
               his walkie-talkie. Turns on his locator. It sparks. It's 
               damaged and broken.

                                     HELLBOY

               Clay stumbles around, lost. He stops under a grate.

                                     HELLBOY'S VOICE
                              (on the walkie-talkie)
                         Who's there? Clay? Come in, someone.

                                     CLAY
                         Clay, Code 30, this is Clay, over...

               Behind Clay, Kroenen drops down from an overhead pipe, through 
               shafts of gray light. He brings forth his customary long 
               blade. Clay turns in time to see Kroenen coming at him. He 
               fires. Kroenen stabs.

               Twin rivulets of blood run from Clay's nostrils.

               Hellboy hears the gunfire, starts running.

               INT. CENTER OF THE TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET)

               Clay falls to the floor.

               Kroenen stands there, unfazed by Clay's bullets in his chest. 
               Dust pours from his wounds and piles up neatly at his feet. 
               He hears Hellboy coming.He places the knife on the floor, 
               then lies down and plays dead.

               Hellboy appears at the end of the tunnel. He glances at 
               Kroenen's body, then quickly checks for a pulse on Clay.

               Hellboy looks demolished.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. TAXI CAB (MOVING) / EXT. BPRD ADJACENT AVENUE - DAY

               An ethnic pop song blasts from the taxi radio. Liz pokes her 
               head out of the window and shoots a Polaroid snapshot. She 
               passes it to Myers:

                                     LIZ
                         It feels good to be outside!! It's 
                         been so long...

               He can't hear her over the music. Myers knocks on the 
               bulletproof acrylic divider.

                                     MYERS
                         Hey!! The music!! Turn down the 
                         music!!

                                     DRIVER
                         Yeah, yeah, music!!

               He merely changes the radio station; the music stays at the 
               same volume. Myers looks back at Liz.

               She is halfway out the window, sitting on the door.

                                     MYERS
                         Jesus! That's not -- That's not safe, 
                         Miss Sherman -- Miss Sherman?

               She takes another Polaroid and passes it down to him. Myers 
               looks at the Polaroid, then smiles. He climbs out of the 
               other window, hands her the photograph.

                                     MYERS
                         Nice view --

               He waves at her. For the first time, she smiles.

                                     MYERS
                         A smile, huh? That's good.

               She takes his picture. With the cold morning wind blowing 
               Liz's hair and the sun on her face, she looks beautiful.

                                     LIZ
                         Don't get used to it.

               Myers taps his fingers on the roof, to the beat of the music. 
               He can't take his eyes off her. They drive towards the BPRD.

               INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - DAY

               Unconscious, Abe floats in a special tank. LED strips read 
               water temperature, pH level, etc. He's encased in a bio-cast: 
               a cybernetic healing unit wrapped around his thorax and right 
               arm. A web of tubes and hoses keeps him in place.

               SHIRTLESS and bandaged, Hellboy sits and studies him, as if 
               in a trance.

                         then.

               He turns to leave. Hellboy gets up.

                         No, it doesn't make it right, but I 
                         stopped that creature, didn't I?

                         In the end, after you've killed and 
                         captured every freak out there -- 
                         there's still one left: you.

                         I wish I could be more gracious but --

               BAMMMMM!!!! He smashes a metal LOCKER with his stone hand 
               and raises it above his head.

               Manning cowers, realizing that Hellboy's rage is a dangerous 
               thing.

               INT. B.P.R.D. - MAIN HALL AREA - DAY

               A new space. Office corridors radiate out from a brass 
               B.P.R.D. logo on the floor. A few agents monitor computer 
               stations and tactical glass boards.

               Liz and Myers walk in, carrying her suitcases. She looks 
               around and sees BROOM coming down the hall.

                         Find your way back. We've made quite 
                         a few changes --

               CRASH!!! Liz screams and Myers draws his gun. Smashing through 
               a glass partition, the mangled steel LOCKER lands in the 
               middle of the hall in a rain of glass and aluminum studs.

               Next, Manning appears, retreating but unharmed.

                                     MANNING
                              (gasping)
                         I want that thing locked up, starting 
                         now -- Now!!! You hear me??!!

               He flees.

                                     LIZ
                              (to Broom)
                         Nothing's changed. Home, sweet home.

               Mortified, Broom hurries after Manning. Hellboy calmly steps 
               through the hole in the wall.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (seeing her)
                         Liz? Liz!!

               She spins on her heel and walks off. Hellboy turns to Myers.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You!!! You did it, buddy --

               Myers holsters his gun and follows Liz. Hellboy is all alone 
               now.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (oblivious)
                         Woo hoo!!

               INT. B.P.R.D. - LIZ'S ROOM - DAY

               A familiar cell. Fireproof insulation covers the walls. Liz 
               throws her bags on the bed. Myers lingers in the doorway.

               She reflexively pulls on one of the rubber bands on her wrist, 
               then lets it snap.

                                     LIZ
                         A little something I learned in 
                         therapy. I'm depressed --
                              (snaps a rubber band)
                         One rubber band. I'm impatient: two 
                         rubber bands...

               He sits by her side on the bed.

                                     MYERS
                         I'll get you a fresh pack.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DUSK

               A cat bats at a ball of paper. On it, two words are visible: 
               DEAR LIZ. Hellboy's tail scoops up the paper and throws it 
               in a brimming wastebasket.

               He's sitting at a stainless steel desk, deep in concentration, 
               writing with evident difficulty. The floor around him is 
               covered with more crumpled pages. In the background, the 
               projector is showing DUCK SOUP. Myers pushes in a cartload 
               of CHILI.

                                     MYERS
                         Where do you --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Shh! Just a second.

               Myers sets the tray on the table.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Myers, you're a talker. What's a 
                         good word -- a solid word for "need" --

                                     MYERS
                         "Need" is a good, solid word.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Nah, sounds too "needy."

                                     MYERS
                         Start in, you got nachos coming.

               As he goes out, Liz appears in the doorway. Hellboy quickly 
               stops writing.

                                     LIZ
                              (notices the small 
                              feline army)
                         Oh, my God... Look at them all! Who 
                         had babies? C'mere, Tiger...!

               Liz plays with a cat. Hellboy lifts the piece of paper, which 
               looks like a postage stamp in his stone hand.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Um... Liz -- I -- there's something 
                         I'd like you to -- something I need 
                         you to hear.

                                     LIZ
                         Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, 
                         but --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Out? Out out?

                                     LIZ
                         For a cup of coffee, but go ahead, 
                         read.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You're going alone?

                                     LIZ
                         No. Myers is taking me.

               Hellboy stands up, walks towards her.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Him!! Why him? Why not me?

               Myers walks back in pushing a tray of nachos.

                                     MYERS
                              (to Hellboy)
                         Hey, your chili's getting cold --

                                     HELLBOY
                              (sits back down)
                         Not hungry.

                                     LIZ
                         What did you want me to hear -- ?

               Hellboy folds the paper.

                                     HELLBOY
                         It's nothing. Just a list -- It's 
                         not finished --

                                     LIZ
                         Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.

               She leaves. Myers smiles.

                                     MYERS
                         Anything else you --

                                     HELLBOY
                              (snappy)
                         Not from you.

                                     MYERS
                         Well good n-

                              (furious)
                         Good night.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. B.D.R.P. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT

               Under a sheet, Kroenen's cold, naked body lies on a slab. 
               Broom talks into a tape recorder.

                                     BROOM
                         The subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen --

               The visible areas of the body make us grateful for the sheet 
               covering the rest.

                                     BROOM
                         Suffered a masochistic compulsion 
                         known as surgical addiction.

               The silver hand and harness lie on a table.

                                     BROOM
                         Both eyelids were surgically removed 
                         along with his upper and lower lips, 
                         making speech impossible. The blood 
                         in his veins dried up decades ago. 
                         Only dust remains.
                              (looks at an X-ray 
                              film)
                         Four pulverized vertebrae. A steel 
                         rod inserted into his pelvis held 
                         him up.
                              (beat)
                         What horrible will power could keep 
                         a thing like this alive?

               He finds the small pieces of paper Kroenen planted in his 
               pouch.

               INT. B.P.R.D. HALLWAYS - NIGHT

               Under the gaze of high-security cameras, AGENT LIME rolls 
               Hellboy's food cart down the corridor and into the domed 
               intersection. He whistles a happy tune. Opens the high 
               security door.

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT

               Lime's jaw drops.

               Across the room, one of the walls has been completely 
               demolished, revealing a SERVICE SHAFT.

               No sign of Hellboy.

                                     LIME
                         Jesus.

               Lime peeks into the SERVICE SHAFT.

               OMIT

               EXT. NEWARK, N.J. - STREETS - NIGHT

               Myers and Liz leave a coffee shop, strolling down the street. 
               Myers hands Liz her coffee. They chat and laugh. He pushes 
               his Moped. She has her Polaroid with her.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

                                     HELLBOY
                         What are you two talking about. What's 
                         so fascinating?? So important?? 

               EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREETS - NIGHT

               Liz and Myers pause at a corner, waiting for the light. The 
               shops are closing.

                                     MYERS
                         I admire him. He's a force of nature.

                                     LIZ
                         He's just pushy.

                                     MYERS
                         No... He's determined. Unstoppable --

                                     LIZ
                         Cocky.

                                     MYERS
                         Strong.

                                     LIZ
                         A brute.

                                     MYERS
                         My uncle used to say... we like people 
                         for their qualities but love them 
                         for their defects.

               Liz half-smiles, sips her coffee.

                                     MYERS
                         He -- loves you.

                                     LIZ
                         I know.

                                     MYERS
                         What about you?

                                     LIZ
                         Don't know. Really. I grew up with 
                         him.
                              (beat)
                         I've missed him too, but now, every 
                         time I see him, I get confused. Hardly 
                         a day goes by he's not in my mind. 
                         Even now, I feel he's here --

               As they walk down the street. A red streak jumps over roof 
               tops.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Hellboy lands neatly on the adjacent roof. He looks down at 
               Myers and Liz --

               Myers offers her cream and sugar.

                                     HELLBOY
                         No cream and sugar, moron. She takes 
                         it black.

               She takes the coffee, waves off the half and half.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Toldya.

               Trying to feel superior, Hellboy chuckles. As they walk, Liz 
               gestures vigorously. His smile fades.

               EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREETS - NIGHT

                                     MYERS
                         It's freezing, isn't it?

                                     LIZ
                         Coffee's warming me up.

               By now, all the shops are closed. They approach a small park 
               near a train track.

                                     MYERS
                         What do we do now? Newark, New Jersey, 
                         entertainment capital of the world.

               She cleans off a wet, dirty bench, sits down.

                                     LIZ
                         You offered me a cup of coffee. I've 
                         got one, so just sit down.

               Myers is falling for her.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

               Hellboy leaps off a building.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Two red hands appear over the rooftop parapet. Cursing, 
               Hellboy hauls himself up. He finds himself next to a pigeon 
               coop where a YOUNG KID is feeding the birds.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hi...

               The kid stares at him.

                                     KID
                         You're Hellboy.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Shh. I'm... on a mission.

               He watches as Liz and Myers sit on the bench.

                         Don't tell anyone, huh?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT

               Broom examines the damage to the wall. He turns to see 
               Hellboy's locator belt hanging on the wall. Broom shakes his 
               head.

                                     LIME
                         Should we send out some scouts?

               Broom motions for him to stop. It's useless,

                                     BROOM
                         No. Enough. He will never change -- 
                         always a child. Always. 

               INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT

               Kroenen's body lies on the table. Slowly, his chest starts 
               to rise and fall. He sits up.

               His arm stump docks into the prosthetic hand -- Click! He 
               flexes the shiny fingers.

               Kroenen's hideous cranium is visible for an instant before 
               he zips up his mask. He takes the sharp Ragnarok knives and 
               turns one over. It reflects a figure standing behind him: 
               Grigory.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               The pigeon kid walks towards Hellboy, carrying two glasses 
               of milk and a plate of cookies.

                                     KID
                         My Mom baked 'em.

               He sits by Hellboy's side as he watches Liz and Myers chatting 
               and laughing.

                                     HELLBOY
                         That's it: she's laughing. I'm done.

               Hellboy grabs three cookies off the plate and scarfs them 
               down.

                                     KID
                         They don't look like spies.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Come on! Look at him, those shifty 
                         eyes, that -- phony grin...!!
                              (seeing the last cookie)
                         You gonna eat that?

               Below, Myers yawns. Hellboy slaps his forehead.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Oh, the yawning trick. That's so 
                         1950's! Watch his arm --

               He looks around, picks up a pebble, hefts it.

               EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREET - LIZ AND MYERS - NIGHT

                                     MYERS
                         We all have a side that we try to 
                         hide...

               Myers stretches and places his hand and arm behind her back. 
               Something hits him in the head.

                                     MYERS
                         Hey! What the hell?

               He gets up, annoyed. No one in sight.

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               Hellboy snickers, hiding and chewing a cookie. The Kid "gives 
               him five".

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Kroenen's two pieces of paper are joined together under a 
               MICRO-SCANNER. Broom watches as computer enhancement fills 
               out a couple of missing areas.

               Cyrillic letters are now legible.

                                     BROOM
                              (pensive)
                         SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16... Moscow.

               Broom pulls out a few old photos. Finds one of Grigory in 
               German uniform, and in a book, another of Grigory in an 
               Orthodox priest's black cassock.

               He pulls out his old wooden box, pulls out a dusty book from 
               it. His fingers scan the text, finding Rasputin's date of 
               birth, date of death. They pause at a particular line: "His 
               mausoleum is at SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16".

                                     BROOM
                         It's Rasputin's mausoleum.

               TCHK!! A noise -- Broom turns in time to see Kroenen 
               delicately descending a spiral staircase, blade in hand. In 
               spite of all his experience, Broom is shaken.

                                     BROOM
                         I see the puppet. But -- where is... 
                         the puppet master?

               In the dark, a voice hisses --

                                     GRIGORY
                         Very good, Professor Broom.

               Broom turns. Grigory steps from the shadows.

                                     BROOM
                         It was you: The scraps of paper, 
                         Liz's sudden relapse and return...

                                     GRIGORI
                              (nods)
                         Bread crumbs on the trail. Like in a 
                         fable. They both distract him and 
                         guide him exactly where I need him.

                                     BROOM

                         His destiny.

               He touches Broom's forehead, lightly --

                                     GRIGORY
                         You raised the child. Nurtured him. 
                         So, In return... Would you permit 
                         me? A brief, brief glimpse? Of the 
                         future --

               FLASH!!

               A nightmarish tableau...

               EXT. RUINS OF N.Y. - DUSK

               The ruins of New York, charred, smoldering. Human remains 
               litter the landscape. Monstrous shapes lumber in the 
               distance... an army of apocalyptic beasts outlined against 
               the blood-red sky.

               Dominating the horror is a mountain of festering skeletons 
               and skulls. At the top, a figure: HELLBOY, transformed. His 
               horns are in full bloom, his eyes and mouth stream unearthly 
               fire.

               INT. BROOM´S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Startled, Broom snaps out of it --

                                     GRIGORY
                         If only you had him destroyed sixty 
                         years ago, none of this would come 
                         to pass. But, then, how could you 
                         have known?

               Broom is speechless.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Your God chooses to remain silent. 
                         Mine lives within me.

               Rasputin stands, the flesh of his neck and shoulders heaving 
               and twitching beneath his human skin.

                                     GRIGORY
                         In the frozen waters of the Malaya 
                         Nevka, in the darkness of the void: 
                         every time I died and crossed over, 
                         a little more of the Master came 
                         back with me. He disclosed to me the 
                         child's true name... Would you like 
                         to know it??

                                     BROOM
                         I know what to call him. Nothing you 
                         can say or do will change that. I 
                         call him son.

               Discreetly, Broom removes his rosary and places it on the 
               book. Kroenen settles in behind him.

                                     BROOM
                         I am ready.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Good. Now, I'll add two crumbs more:
                              (Kroenen displays his 
                              knives)
                         Grief and revenge...

               Kroenen's knife goes in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               The pigeons flutter on the rooftop.

               The pigeon kid sits by Hellboy's side.

                                     KID
                         Just go down there and tell her how 
                         you feel!
                              (Hellboy shakes his 
                              head: no)
                         My mom says --

                         It's not that easy, okay?
                              (beat)
                         Plus, you're nine. You're not old 
                         enough to give me advice.

                                     KID
                              (shrugs)
                         Who are those guys??

               Hellboy turns and sees --

               TWO of the black B.P.R.D. Sedan cars rounds the corner.

               Agent Lime bounds out of one of the vehicles, grabbing Myers, 
               talking rapidly. Liz screams, covers her ears.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Something's wrong --

               OMIT

               INT. B.P.R.D. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Agents and Bureau employees are crammed into Broom's office 
               doorway. Hellboy, face contorted by grief, pushes through.

               INT. BROOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The room is full of forensics people taking pictures, picking 
               up evidence, etc. Tom Manning is there. Seeing Hellboy, he 
               respectfully steps back.

               Broom's fragile body lies slumped in his chair. At his feet, 
               a pool of blood. Liz enters, then stifles a whimper.

               With tears in his eyes, a disbelieving Hellboy looks at Liz, 
               then at his dead father. He holds Broom's body close to his 
               chest.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Father -- I'm back. I'm back. I'm 
                         back.

               Manning herds everybody out. From the door, Liz blinks back 
               tears as the red giant kneels by the body: a dog with a lost 
               master.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I wasn't here. You died alone --

               The PALLBEARERS, Manning and Myers among them, load Broom's 
               casket into a HEARSE. Flanking it are two rows of BPRD agents.

               The hearse doors close and the vehicle pulls away.

               Watching like a gargoyle from a distant roof: Hellboy. Rain 
               bounces off his wet overcoat.

               Liz observes him, worried.

                                     LIZ'S VOICE
                         He hasn't spoken to anyone in three 
                         days. Not a word. He doesn't eat, he 
                         doesn't sleep...

               Abe, conscious now, but still in the cast, floats upside 
               down, solving a RUBIK'S CUBE. Liz stands by the tank.

               Their hands almost touch, separated only by the glass.

               bandaged.

               Liz watches him from across the room. He finds Broom's rosary 
               on top of the book. Reads the underlined phrase on the page.

                                     LIZ
                         Hi --

               He turns to her. She slowly comes towards him.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hi.

                                     LIZ
                         I've changed my mind. I'll come to 
                         Moscow. If you -- are still going --

               Hellboy nods, then clears his throat.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I am.
                              (beat)
                         But -- I have something to say, too.
                              (beat)
                         I never had the guts before -

               He looks her in the eye.

                                     HELLBOY
                         But I understand what you don't like 
                         about me. I do. What I am makes you 
                         feel out of place -- out there --

                                     LIZ
                         Red, I --

                         Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes 
                         you feel like you belong. And -- 
                         that's good. It really is. I -- wish 
                         I could do something about this --
                              (points at his own 
                              face)
                         But I can't.
                              (beat)
                         I can promise you only two things... 
                         One: I'll always look this good. 
                         Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.

                                     LIZ
                         I like that...

               EXT. MOSCOW WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Super: TOPOCKBA STEEL MILLS, MOSCOW A wasteland of rust and 
               decay. Rotting warehouses line the street like dead steel 
               watchdogs. No one's around but a few lonely sentries.

               A limo and motorcycle caravan are waved through the security 
               gates.

               INT. MOSCOW WAREHOUSE - DUSK

               A metal door trundles back and the limo and escort motorcycles  
               enter.

               Fleshy Russian General -- LAPIKOV -- gets out of the limo. 
               Then Ilsa and Grigory.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         I have accumulated many objects of 
                         great interest. Preserving our 
                         heritage.

               The warehouse contains a world of bric-a-brac: a towering 
               marble LENIN HEAD, Old Master paintings, tanks, warheads, 
               missiles, etc.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         Many -- like me -- believe Mother 
                         Russia to be very close to a historic 
                         rebirth.

               They stop before a cargo container. With a butane torch, a 
               soldier melts away the lead Kremlin seal, then open the doors.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Rebirth? I like that.

                         Twenty tons of stone. This thing 
                         fell from the sky into Tungaska

                         June 30th, 1908. It burned hundreds 
                         of square miles of forest. The 
                         Romanovs took possession of it 
                         immediately. The Czar guarded it 
                         jealously -- I have wanted it for 
                         ages.

               Grigory's fingers brush over its smooth, perfect surface. At 
               the center --

               -- TWO CIRCULAR IMPRINTS that match Hellboy's four-fingered 
               stone hand.

                         Now, finally, it's mine.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         You are aware, of course, there's no 
                         way you'll get it out of Russian 
                         territory.

                              (curtly)
                         He is aware.

               Ilsa brings out a chrome box, full of gold.

                                     GENERAL LAPIKOV
                         It's a pleasure doing business with 
                         you. Perhaps you have other interests.

               Grigory's voice drips with serene brutality.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Enjoy the bright metal you've earned. 
                         There will be no further transactions.

               Our group plus TWO AGENTS (Lime and Stone) venture into the

                         don't separate --

               INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR AND INTERSECTION - DAY

               TCHKANGGG!!!!! large spiked metal plates shoot up from below, 
               blocking both their way out, demolishing the staircase and 
               ramming Stone: he's gone.

               Wicked spikes cover the metal surface. Hellboy still bangs 
               on it, but to no avail: it's at least six inches thick. Liz 
               and Myers are on the other side.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (into his walkie-talkie)
                         Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn 
                         on your locators -- Anyone sees 
                         anything...

                                     LIZ
                         Marco...

                                     HELLBOY
                         ...Polo.

               On the other side of the panel, Myers takes the radio from 
               Liz.

                                     MYERS
                              (into radio)
                         Are you sure about this?

                                     HELLBOY
                         On a scale of one to ten: two. But --
                              (beat)
                         -- she'll take care of you, Myers. 
                         She's a tough one.

               Liz and Myers move off. Hellboy shines his light down the 
               tunnel on the left. Agent Lime picks up the corpse and 
               follows.

               INT. TUNNEL "A" / CHAMBER - DAY

               Hellboy and Manning come into a vast chamber: Slavic motifs 
               crown the rugged stone pillars and archways. Water runs down 
               the walls.

               Across a small stone bridge, light pours from a hexagonal 
               structure.

               They step onto the bridge. KLANGGG!!! two gears release a 
               steel door from above, forcing them to forge ahead.

               Somewhere, a  massive clockwork is TICKING.

                                     MANNING
                         What's that --

               Hellboy motions for silence. The CORPSE mutters: "IT'S 
               SOMETHING BIG"

               They stare into the darkness.

                                     MANNING
                         We should go back -- you -- you could 
                         tear that door apart --

                                     HELLBOY
                         Don't move. We --

                                     MANNING
                         -- should go back. Now!

                                     HELLBOY
                         No. Don't --

                                     MANNING
                         I'm in charge. We go back!

               Hellboy yanks Manning just in time. BAMMM!!!! A gigantic 
               metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the 
               bridge a few feet from their feet. It takes Lime and the 
               CORPSE with it.

               Another door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Son of a --

               Whoosh! The PENDULUM swings back. It destroys more of the 
               bridge. Manning sprints for all he's worth and crawls under 
               the door.

               Hellboy runs, but chunks of stone disintegrate under his 
               feet.

               The pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the 
               bridge just as Hellboy rolls under the door --

               -- and makes it into the hexagonal building.

               INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Hellboy and Manning find themselves in a very narrow, arched 
               stone corridor. Its walls are lined with endless rows of 
               rusty steel blades.

               Faint traces of WAGNER can be heard. They cautiously 
               proceed...

               INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

               There. In yellow gaslight, Kroenen nods attentively as a 
               phonograph plays the love duet from TRISTAN UND ISOLDE.

               Above him, ropes, hooks and pulleys.

               INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Manning rest his hand too close to a blade.

                                     MANNING
                         Ouch!!

               INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

               Kroenen comes alert. He scans the room, quietly winds himself 
               up.

               INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Hellboy shoots a dirty look at Manning and then looks back 
               into the chamber --

               -- Kroenen is gone.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (to Manning)
                         Crap. This guy moves like a cockroach --

               Hellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab.

               INT.  HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

               Hellboy's footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor. 
               Manning moves along behind him.

               The record finishes playing. Silence --

               SWISH!!! Kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping 
               into Manning's arm. As Kroenen goes in for the kill -- 

               -- Hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. Kroenen 
               bears down but Hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate 
               blocks.

               Kroenen hauls out one of his long swords.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Screw that.

               Hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig. BAMMMM!!!! 
               He punches Kroenen in the face, crumpling the steel mask, 
               smashing its lenses.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You killed my father --

               BAMMM!!!! another hit.

               Kroenen staggers back with each blow. Finally, the mask falls 
               off.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Give your soul to God, Your ass is 
                         mine.

               An asthmatic wheeze erupts from his scarred face. Kroenen is 
               laughing.

               INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               BAM!!! Under his feet, a huge trapdoor falls open. He and 
               Manning drop through, along with the phonograph.

               Hellboy grabs a rope. It spins through a copper pulley, but 
               a large knot jerks him to a stop. Hellboy snatches Manning's 
               hand, but loses his backpack.

               He looks down. The phonograph hits the ground with a crash.

                                     MANNING
                              (panting, whispers)
                         Well, it's not that big a fall...

               KLANGGGG!!!!! The entire bottom bristles with six-foot, 
               sparkling steel blades.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Kroenen cautiously leans over the pit. He can't hear a sound.

               As he peeks -- SWISH!! A loop of the rope wraps around his 
               neck and yanks him forward! Before he goes over, he 
               frantically digs his blades into the floor, anchoring himself.

               INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy has used the rope hanging below him as a lasso. 
               MANNING clings to his powerful back as he climbs up, hand 
               over hand.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Kroenen goes to cut the rope...

               INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

                                     HELLBOY
                              (reaching the top)
                         Oh, no you don't --

               Hellboy wraps the rope around his stone fist and, with a 
               brutal stone-fist yank, pulls KROENEN into the pit!

               With a horrible scream, Kroenen drops headfirst past them 
               and onto the spikes. He wriggles like a fish caught on a 
               hook, only making it worse, as he slides further down the 
               blades.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy climbs out and sits. Sees Kroenen's blade embedded 
               in the floor. Holding it: the prosthetic hand, still ticking.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy peers down. Still alive, Kroenen frees one arm, 
               slicing through his own ropy bicep.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You like playing possum, you Nazi 
                         pinhead?
                              (beat)
                         Then try playing dead.

               INT. BOTTOM OF HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Hellboy tips a massive cogwheel over the edge. Kroenen emits 
               a horrid scream as it crushes him.

               INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

               Manning sits down, bandaging his injuries. Hellboy kneels 
               down.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Are you okay?

               Manning nods weakly. Hellboy brings out a cigar and fires up 
               his Zippo.

                                     HELLBOY
                         You'd better stay here. I'll find a 
                         way out. We'll come back for you.

                                     MANNING
                         You call that thing a cigar??

                                     HELLBOY
                         Yup.

                                     MANNING
                         You never, ever light a cigar that 
                         way.

               He digs out one of his fine cigars, cuts it and hands it to 
               HELLBOY.

                                     MANNING
                         Use a wooden match. It preserves the 
                         flavor.

               He lights it for him. Hellboy grins.

                                     MANNING
                         Thank you.

                                     HELLBOY

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND NARROW TUNNEL - DAY

               A narrow tunnel. Liz and Myers advance carefully.

               Just ahead, a cave-in. Pieces of ceiling, timber, coffins 
               and corpses form a chaotic barrier. As they squeeze past...

                                     MYERS
                         So, he thinks that you and I... That's 
                         why he's mad at me --

               A few bones roll by. Wet earth drops onto their shoulders. 
               They draw their arms close to their bodies, pointing their 
               flashlight beams straight down. A moment of strange intimacy.

                                     MYERS
                         But it's not true, is it?

                                     LIZ
                         What -- ?

                                     MYERS
                         That you feel that way about me.

                                     LIZ
                         You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? 
                         Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all 
                         the same.

               INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - STEEP SLOPE - DAY

               Hellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for 
               handholds. He reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath.

               Light filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly 
               hear Liz and Myers.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CAVERN AREA - DAY

               Liz and Myers reach a wider section of Tunnel "B". They find 
               themselves calf-deep in brown water.

               Myers lights Liz's path as she steps onto a large stone.

                                     MYERS
                         Watch out. It's slippery...

               His light shorts out. She shines her light past him.

                                     LIZ
                         Oh, my God...

               Myers turns. His flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex 
               natural cavern. An entire WALL IS COVERED with translucent 
               eggs.

               SAMMAEL is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand 
               still attached. When the light hits his face, his milky pupils 
               constrict. A snarl...

               A SECOND SAMMAEL emerges from the water. It shakes itself 
               off. A THIRD ONE raise its head.

               Myers and Liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right 
               behind them KLANKKKKK!!! They are trapped!!

               Myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. Tries to set up 
               the timer. Zipp! -- one Sammael snatches them away. Myers 
               falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured.

                                     LIZ
                              (into the radio)
                         Marco, Marco, Marco... Get your Big 
                         Red butt over here!

               Something stomps on the ceiling directly above them. Again 
               and again.

               INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FLOOR - DAY

               Hellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. Furiously.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Hang on kid, I'm coming for you!!

               The rocks below him start to crumble.

               EXT. ANTHILL VIEW OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND PITS - DAY

               In an "ANT FARM" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above, 
               pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY

               Dust and rocks fall from above. The four identical creatures 
               move in on Liz and Myers. Myers shoots one in the head three 
               times. The creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with 
               pebbles.

               One of them springs. As it flies through the air, Hellboy 
               crashes through the ceiling. He lands on top of it along 
               with a ton or two of stone. The creature is crushed.

               Two eggs glow, metamorphosing. Presto -- two new Sammaels 
               are born. The first two Sammaels growl, joined by the two 
               new ones. Liz sprints to safety.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Sorry. Just couldn't leave you two 
                         alone.

               Hellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz.

               Lit by Myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One 
               clamps onto Hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy 
               howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a 
               zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back.

               Hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest 
               of a Sammael. Two eggs glow -- two new Sammaels are born. 
               They're FIVE.

               Hellboy's torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground. 
               A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy 
               is in trouble.

               Liz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her 
               body.

                                     LIZ
                              (at Myers)
                         Hit me.

                                     MYERS
                         What?

               Liz is desperate, crying.

                                     LIZ
                         Hit me --
                              (beat)
                         All of my life I've run away from 
                         it... Now I want it to happen! Do 
                         it.

               Hellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies. 
               Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers.

                                     MYERS
                         I can't, I --

               Liz slaps him.

                                     LIZ
                         I know now: I love him. I've always 
                         loved him.

               A beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face, 
               once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around 
               her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal's.

                                     LIZ
                         Go now.

               Myers ducks behind a rock as Liz's arms blaze with fire.

               The two approaching Sammaels are ready to pounce.

               On top of Hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion 
               hearing the hunter's gunshots. A staggering Hellboy sees 
               Liz's body shake in a surge of white-hot energy.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (weak)
                         Liz...

               The water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of 
               fire expands.

               The fire engulfs the creatures. Devours them all.

               INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA -  DAY

               The screen FADES TO WHITE and then...

               Silence, then a pulse. A high ringing tone. A heartbeat.

               Hellboy pushes away the half-cooked remains of two Sammaels. 
               The other creatures are little more than blackened bones. He 
               stumbles forward. No water left. Everything is half-buried 
               in a cracked, bone-dry bed of mud. Liz lies on the ground, 
               on her side, unconscious.

               Myers is alive, but too groggy to even acknowledge it. Weakly, 
               Hellboy turns around: In the eerie silence of his deafness, 
               he sees Grigory -- LAUGHING noiselessly, witness to an absurd 
               comedy.

               Ilsa approaches. And -- in a simple, brutal move -- hits him 
               with a hammer --

               FADE OUT / FADE IN

               OMIT

               INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden 
               yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings: a large church-
               like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding 
               swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR 
               SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar.

               Off to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on 
               the explosive belts.

               Next to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under 
               his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab 
               bought from Lapikov.

               Liz lies at Grigory's feet. He's dressed in a ceremonial 
               robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy, 
               he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key.

                                     GRIGORY
                         "And I looked and beheld an Angel, 
                         and in his hand the key to the 
                         bottomless pit..."

               Hellboy tenses, rage building. The yoke creaks, but doesn't 
               bend.

                                     GRIGORY
                              (gestures at the stone 
                              piece)
                         These were the words I heard as a 
                         peasant boy in Tobolsk. And now, the 
                         door -- Sent by the Ogdruh Jahad so 
                         that they might at long last enter 
                         our world.

                                     ILSA
                              (to Hellboy)
                         You are the key! The right hand of 
                         doom!

               Hellboy studies the stone sculpture, its three HAND IMPRINTS --

                                     ILSA
                              (triumphant)
                         What did you think it was made for? 
                         Open the locks.

               Hellboy stares at his huge right arm, as if for the first 
               time.

                                     MYERS
                         Don't do it!! Don't do it!!

               Ilsa kicks Myers in the face.

                                     ILSA
                         Silence!!

               The open dome above reveals the moon. An eclipse is beginning. 
               The altar's clockworks monitors its progress.

                                     ILSA
                         Imagine it: An eden for you and her --

                                     HELLBOY
                         No.

               Grigory turns to Hellboy.

                                     GRIGORY
                         No?
                              (reasonable)
                         In exchange for her life then, open 
                         the door.

               In torment, Hellboy, shakes his head: no.

                                     GRIGORY
                         As you wish.

               He leans over Liz, whispers in her ear: Her body arches, her 
               mouth emits a plume of energy. Grigory greedily inhales it. 
               Then she goes limp.

                                     GRIGORY
                         She's dead.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Noooo! Noooo!!!

               He struggles again. One of the cuffs snaps. He swats Ilsa 
               with his free hand. She stumbles backwards. Now Hellboy fights 
               to free his other hand. Indifferent, Grigory watches the 
               eclipse.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Her soul awaits on the other side. 
                         If you want her back...
                              (beat)
                         Open the door and claim her.

               His head and heart racing, Hellboy struggles for an answer. 
               Can't find one... the moon is almost totally eclipsed.

               He drops his gaze. His voice a hoarse whisper.

                                     HELLBOY
                         For her.

               Grigory moves close to Hellboy. Rips the rosary off his wrist. 
               It lands near Myers.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Names hold the power and nature of 
                         things. Mine for example. Rasputin: 
                         "The crossroads."
                              (beat)
                         And crossroads I have become.
                              (beat)
                         Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat 
                         it. Become the key.

                                     HELLBOY
                              (closing his eyes)
                         Anung-un-Rama...

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy's stone arm glows. Ancient symbols of fire burn the 
               stone. Flames momentarily engulf his body.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy roars as his HORNS majestically burst forth! Out of 
               his mouth, energy and light boil like condensing breath on a 
               winter's night.

               Inebriated with power, the new PRINCE OF HELL smiles with 
               supreme arrogance. His shadow falls on the white marble of 
               the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone 
               turns black as obsidian.

                                     MYERS
                         No!! Don't do it!! Listen to me!!

               HELLBOY inserts his enormous paw into the FIRST IMPRINT on 
               the stone slab -- CLACK!! He turns it, like a lock.

               A beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky.

               EXT. VIEW FROM THE CITY - NIGHT

               Visible from all over Moscow, the beam blazes to the moon! 
               The same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it's 
               more intense, with ripples and haloes.

               INT. THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

               Again, the infinite, starry space. Again, the OGDRU JAHAD. 
               The ruby beam pierces the darkness.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy watches as the FIRST IMPRINT disappears. In its place: 
               a burning glyph.

               Myers struggles with his bindings. The rough hemp cuts his 
               skin, but he manages to free one hand.

               EXT. ON THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

               OGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs 
               uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the 
               frame.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy thrusts his hand into the SECOND IMPRINT. CLACK! He 
               turns it.

               Myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it --

               INT. THE SKY - NIGHT

               IN THE STORM CLOUDS, LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES GARGANTUAN 
               TENTACLES REACHING INTO THE EARTHLY PLANE.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs.

                                     GRIGORY
                         The final seal. Open it!

               Hellboy puts his hand inside, CLACK!!! Before he can turn 
               it, Myers reaches the rosary. Ilsa lunges at him. He clobbers 
               her full in the face. She staggers back and down.

                                     MYERS
                              (to Hellboy)
                         Remember who you are!!!

               He throws the rosary at Hellboy. Instinctively, Hellboy 
               catches it. It smokes in his hand.

               He tosses it away. It lands next to the explosive belts.

               Hellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint 
               of the cross and beads. He looks over at Grigory.

               With a blood-curdling scream, Hellboy grabs his horns with 
               both hands, brutally snaps them off. Energy spews from the 
               stumps.

               He stabs Grigory with one of them. Grigory drops to his knees, 
               holding his stomach. Hellboy drops the blood-stained horn.

               The final lock disappears into the stone. The light flickers 
               and the connection with the moon is broken.

               Ilsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. The sky is silent. 
               The thunderclouds are parting. The eclipse has ended.

               Grigory crumples in agony.

               The burning glyphs in Hellboy's stone hand dim down, his 
               features and body resume their usual shape. All is quiet.

                                     GRIGORY
                         You will never fulfill your destiny. 
                         You will never understand the power 
                         inside you.

                                     HELLBOY
                         I can live with that.

               He breaks Myers' chains, helps him up.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy painfully takes Liz's limp body in his arms. Myers 
               stands by his side.

               He kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down 
               the steps.

               Myers steps on something. He looks under his foot: A smashed 
               GLASS EYE. Then... out of the silence, a WHISPER.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Child...

               Hellboy turns. Grigory, on his knees, smiles.

                                     GRIGORY
                              (dying)
                         Look what you've done --

               He looks up. In his empty eye socket, fleshy tendrils shift 
               lazily.

                                     GRIGORY
                         You've killed me -- an insignificant 
                         man... but you have brought forth a 
                         God.

               He uncovers his abdomen. Long, fleshy pseudopods spill out 
               of the wound, like intestines.

               A large entity erupts from Grigory's torso and claws the 
               air.

                                     GRIGORY
                         Behold, my master, Behemoth. Guardian 
                         of thresholds, destroyer of worlds.

               Covered in steamy slime, a seven foot, multi-tentacled shape --
               BABY BEHEMOTH -- lands on the stone slab. The squirming flesh 
               surges up like greasy pink foam. Growing exponentially by 
               the second.

               Ilsa kneels and embraces Grigory's corpse. Kisses him on the 
               mouth. A gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them.

                                     ILSA
                         Hell will hold no surprises for us.

               A tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both.

               INT. CATACOMBS - ADJACENT TUNNEL - NIGHT

               In a passageway, Hellboy carefully hands Liz's body over to 
               Myers.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll 
                         deal with whatever's back there.

                                     MYERS
                         Alone?

                                     HELLBOY
                         How big can it be?

               As if in response, a massive tentacle fills the tunnel, 
               reaching for him. Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling smash 
               onto HELLBOY´S head as he is pulled back at breakneck speed, 
               finally confronting --

               INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               BEHEMOTH!!! The size of a house --

               Hellboy -- head smoking -- writhes in the grip of the 
               tentacle. It suddenly throws him toward the ceiling.

               As he arcs back down, ABM!! -- he cracks the floor wide open. 
               Next to him: the rosary and the EXPLOSIVE BELTS. He tries to 
               grab them. The tentacle slams down, blocking his way.

               The vibration sends the belts down into the crack. They bounce 
               off a small ledge and land further down. Far below, grinding 
               cogwheels and gears.

               Hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble 
               statue.

               Hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all he's worth. 
               FWAP! He cuts clean through the tentacle. The tip hits the 
               floor, rolling into the crack.

               From out of Behemoth's stump... a mass of wriggling tentacles 
               replaces the cut-off section! They squirm around Hellboy's 
               face as he slashes, again and again, fighting his way forward.

               He leans into the crack, stretches his arm, struggling to 
               grab the belts. A few inches short. He jumps into the crevice, 
               onto the first ledge. It crumbles!!

               The gears below grind a few falling bricks. The belts slide 
               away.

               A tentacle captures Hellboy, pulls him up. At the last second, 
               he grabs the belts with his tail.

               The beast raises Hellboy high. A multi-layered mouth opens 
               in the body of BEHEMOTH. The most horrible proboscis ever 
               seen.

               Hellboy's tail passes him the belts.

               The timers on them are crushed. A spark spurts: Useless.

                                     HELLBOY
                         They never work --

               He wraps them around his stone arm.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Ugh -- Now, this is gonna hurt --

               He pulls the pin on all the explosives. BEHEMOTH drops him 
               into a squid-like beak and gulps him down.

               After a moment, a weird gurgle emanates from the creature's 
               innards. Then --

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               A surge of light roils within the thing, outlining the pulpy 
               organs. The creature starts to burn.

               OMIT

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               A chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as Behemoth 
               is enveloped in a cloud of fire, goo and soft flesh.

               Hellboy lands with a sickening, bone-crunching THUD!!!

               With a bellow, Behemoth goes down, the limp tentacles missing 
               Hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light. 
               Finally, just a few cinders of flesh float in the air.

               INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

               Hellboy stands, covered in goo. Two final shockwaves of light 
               ripple over the ground.

                                     HELLBOY
                         Ouch -- It did hurt.

               INT. ADJACENT TUNNEL

               Hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots Myers. Painfully 
               drags himself over. Liz's body is on the floor.

               Manning limps in from an adjacent room. Hellboy cradles Liz's 
               head in his huge hand. Holds her against his powerful chest 
               and whispers in her ear.

               A beat or two, then a moan.

                                     LIZ
                         In the dark -- I heard your voice -- 
                         What -- did you say -- ?

               He looks at her, lovingly caressing her hair.

                                     HELLBOY
                         "You, on the other side: let her go. 
                         Because for her, for her -- I'll 
                         die. I'll cross over."
                              (beat)
                         "And you'll be sorry I did."

               Myers smiles. Liz looks at Hellboy for the first time as 
               what he is: the man she loves. A warm, gentle fire rims her 
               body.

               Manning watches. Agent Myers smiles a sad smile, illuminated 
               by the flames.

               Hellboy and Liz kiss. The fire haloes them and builds as Tom 
               Waits' CINNY'S WALTZ fills the air.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

1    TITLE SEQUENCE

     In darkness, a blood-curdling cacophony:  the squeal
     of unoiled winches, the rasp of hooks and razors
     being sharpened; and worse, the howl of tormented
     souls.  Above this din one particular victim yells
     for mercy - a mixture of tears and roars of rage.

     By degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by
     the surrounding tumult, until without warning his
     voice pierces the confusion afresh - this time
     reduced to naked scream.

     And with the sound, an image.

     A house:  NUMBER 55, LODOVICO STREET, an old, three
     storey, late Victorian house, with gaunt trees lining
     its overgrown garden.  Its curtains are drawn, there
     is newspaper over its top window.  The titles begin
     to run, as we approach the house down the driveway.

     We move inside, to the hallway.  The cries are
     louder now.

     Room by room, we explore the empty house, while the
     titles continue to run.  It has been left empty for
     many years, though much of its furniture remains,
     covered in dust-sheets.  On the mantelpiece of one room,
     a plaster saint.  In the kitchen, evidence of life
     here.  Opened tins; bread; bottles of spirits; a
     glass.

     We move upstairs, gliding along the corridor of the
     lower landing.  The din is furious now.  On the
     floor of one room, a makeshift bed: blankets strewn;
     an open suitcase; more liquor.

     We move up a flight and approach a room off the upper
     landing, the door of which is ajar.  The light
     within swings backwards and forwards, spilling into
     the passageway.

     As we reach the door, the screams from within halt
     abruptly.

     We can hear a bell now, which has been pealing
     steadily throughout this opening sequence.

     As we move through the door, the titles end.


2    INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

     The bare bulbs in the room we've entered swing violently,
     disorienting us.  There are chains - dozens of them -
     disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling: all
     are swinging back and forth.  Some end in hooks, with
     pieces of skin and sinew adhering; some are serrated,
     others simply drip blood.

     The bell tolls on.

     On the blood-spattered floor, a box, some six inches
     square, which resembles an elaborate Chinese puzzle
     box.  Later, we'll learn its name and function.
     It's called the Lament Configuration, and it's a
     way to raise Hell.  LITERALLY. For now, it remains
     an enigma.

     A hand, its flesh systematically pierced with needles,
     reaches down and picks the box up.

     In close up we see just what an elaborate construction
     it is, made up of sliding panels and mysterious
     chambers.  It is open at present, its polished
     innards exposed.  Out of it, a banal melody, played
     on a hidden mechanism.  The hands, which belong to
     one of the demons - a CENOBITE - move over the box.

                             CENOBITE
                       (unseen)
                It's over ...

     Delicately, the hands begin to reconstruct the box,
     sliding the well-oiled parts back into place, the
     tune simplifying with each manoeuvre.

     The room is getting darker.  The chains are disappearing
     into the gloom.

     We see tantalizing glimpses of other figures, turning
     from the light and fading into the darkness.  We catch
     sight of monstrous faces, but only for the briefest
     of moments.  Then they're gone.

     The box is almost returned to its unopened condition.

     The last sounds to fade are the tune from the box,
     and the bell.

     It tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid
     into place.

     The light stops swinging. The panel clicks.  The tune
     stops.

     At last, a long shot of the room.  At the far end the
     window is covered with yellowed newspapers.  There is
     dust settling through the air.

     Otherwise it is empty.

     The bell fades.

     It's as if nothing ever happened here.

     Except ...

     Somewhere, very quietly, a creaking that could be
     the sound of floorboards, or the low, agonized gasp
     of a thing barely alive.


3    INT.   HALLWAY    DAY

     The wind is blaring as we watch the door of Number
     55. From the doorstep, voices.  One is that of
     LARRY COTTON, the other his wife JULIA.  Clearly
     LARRY is attempting to get inside.  We hear the
     sound of keys tried in the lock.

                             LARRY
                It's one of these.

                             JULIA
                We're going to freeze to death.

                             LARRY
                0.K.  0.K.

     The sound of another key tried in the lock.

                             JULIA
                Maybe somebody changed the lock.

                             LARRY
                       (slightly irritated)
                Like who?

                             JULIA
                Just a thought -

                             LARRY
                Ah!

     The key is turned.

                             LARRY
                Success.

     The door swings open.

                Voila!

     We see the pair on the doorstep.  LARRY is an American
     in his early forties, an attractive man who has lost
     his edge in recent years.  He looks harassed; he smirks
     too much.  A little, but significant, corner of him
     is utterly defeated.  JULIA, his wife, is English:
     and looks perhaps ten years his junior.  She is
     beautiful, but her face betrays a barely buried
     unhappiness.  Life has disappointed her too, of
     late: and LARRY has been a major part of their
     disappointment.

                             LARRY
                Well.  This is it.

     They step over the threshold.


4    INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY

     The door of the Torture Room creaks, as the wind blows
     it opens an inch.  From downstairs, we hear JULIA's
     voice.

                             JULIA
                It smells damp.

                             LARRY
                It's just been empty a while.


5    INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

    LARRY slams the front door.


6    INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY

     The Torture Room door creaks closed again.

                             LARRY
                       (from below)
                Besides, it's an old house.


7    INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

     He stands in the hallway, not certain which way to
     go from here.

                             JULIA
                How long since you were here?

                             LARRY
                The best part of ten years.

     LARRY picks up some mail - circulars mostly - from
     behind the door, then leads JULIA through from the
     hallway to explore the ground floor.

                             LARRY
                I wanted to sell it off at
                one point, after the old Lady
                died, but I couldn't get Frank
                to agree.

     He opens one of the doors, and looks inside.

                             LARRY
                       (with pleasure)
                Christ.  It's not been touched.

     He continues along the passageway.  He opens another
     door, and steps into a large room.  He opens one of
     the curtains.  Light pours in, dust-laden shafts falling
     on the sheeted furniture.

                             LARRY
                Look at this.

     JULIA lingers in the doorway.

                             JULIA
                Why didn't he want to sell it?

                             LARRY
                       (dismissively)
                I don't know. Probably wanted
                a hideaway.

     He pulls a sheet off a chair.

                Look at this stuff.

     The chair is ugly; old fashioned.  JULIA is unimpressed.

                             JULIA
                Not exactly modern.

                             LARRY
                       (shrugs)
                We'll sell it.  Sell everything.

                             JULIA
                I thought half of it was your
                brother's?

                             LARRY
                He won't complain.  He can pay
                off some of his creditors.

     LARRY is getting more enthusiastic about the place by
     the moment.  He leaves the room, moving past JULIA
     to explore further.

                             LARRY
                You know we have to let Kirsty
                see this place, before we do
                anything to it.  She'll love it.

                             JULIA
                You mean we're moving in?

     LARRY pauses.  Looks at her.

                             LARRY
                You don't like it?

     JULIA shrugs.

                             JULIA
                It's better than Brooklyn.

     She turns back down the hallway. He watches her, then
     follows.

                             LARRY
                You're still blaming me.

                             JULIA
                No.  I'm not.

                             LARRY
                You wanted to come back to
                London.  We came back.

     We are hearing the tip of a debate they've had dozens
     of times, which immediately annoys them both.

                             JULIA
                All right.

                             LARRY
                So what's the argument?

                             JULIA
                       (cold)
                No argument.

                             LARRY
                Oh Christ.  Julia ...

     JULIA wanders back to the bottom of the stairs.  Then
     starts to climb.

                             LARRY
                       (exasperated, to
                        himself)
                Shit.


8    INT.   LANDING   DAY

     JULIA climbs the stairs, her face charged with suppressed
     feeling.  She's sick of LARRY; his enthusiasm depresses
     her, his compromises anger her.  What's between them
     is stale, like this house.


9    INT.    TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     The door opens a fraction.


10   INT.   KITCHEN    DAY

     LARRY has stepped into the kitchen, to find the remains
     of the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence,
     now rotted and fungal.  It smells, to judge the
     expression on his face.  It also puzzles him. Then,
     from above:

                             JULIA
                Larry!

     He leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the
     bottom of the stairs.

                Larry!

                             LARRY
                I hear you.

     He starts up the stairs.


11   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     LARRY reaches the top of the stairs.

                             LARRY
                Where are you?

                             JULIA
                       (out of sight)
                In here.

     LARRY follows JULIA's voice to the end of the corridor.
     JULIA is standing in a doorway.  Beyond, the 'bedroom'
     we saw in the titles sequence, untouched since then.

                             JULIA
                Squatters?

     LARRY steps past her, and throws back the blankets.
     Wood-lice scurry away.  He goes to the suitcase, and
     starts looking through it.  Besides clothes there's a
     lot else that speaks of its owner: bric-a-brac picked
     up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets;
     Fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from
     a dozen countries.  Amongst the stuff, some photographs.
     LARRY peers at them.  One pictures a good-looking
     intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed
     with a naked Chinese girl.

                             LARRY
                Frank.

     At the door, we see JULIA almost flinch at the name.

                             JULIA
                He's here?

                             LARRY
                He's been here.  There's stuff
                in the kitchen.  He must have
                made a hasty exit.

     The 'phone rings downstairs.  JULIA jumps.

                That'll be Kirsty.

     LARRY stands up and leaves the room, moving past JULIA
     in the doorway, who is left to stare down at the
     bed FRANK has slept in, and the suitcase of belongings.
     As we hear LARRY clatter downstairs it seems JULIA's
     face is close to tears.


12   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY

     The 'phone continues to ring.  LARRY steps through
     and picks up the receiver.

                             LARRY
                Hello ...?

     There's no answer.

                Hello ...?


13   INT.   FRANK'S 'BEDROOM'   DAY

     JULIA goes to the open suitcase, and looks at the
     photographs.


14   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM    DAY

                             LARRY
                       (on'phone)
                Is there anybody there?

     He puts down the 'phone.  He goes back out into the
     hall.


15   INT.   FRANK'S 'BEDROOM'   DAY

     Nervous that LARRY will return and see what she's
     doing, JULIA is going through the photographs.

                             LARRY
                       (from below)
                There's nobody there -

     The sound of his foot on the stairs.  Hurriedly, she
     selects a photograph of Frank without the girl, and
     pockets it.


16   INT.   STAIRS   DAY

     LARRY is climbing the stairs.

                             LARRY
                I'm surprised it's even connected ...

     The 'phone rings again.

                Shit.


17   INT.   FRANK'S BEDROOM    DAY

     Mission accomplished, JULIA leaves the bedroom, taking
     one last glance at the sweat-stained sheet and the
     indented pillar where Frank lay.  A lone wood-louse
     crawls over the sheet, navigating the folds.  She
     closes the door on the sight.  Downstairs, the
     'phone stops ringing.


18   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY

     LARRY has picked up the 'phone.

                             LARRY
                Who's there?

                             KIRSTY
                       (barely audible)
                Daddy?

                                            CUT TO


19   INT.   KIRSTY'S ROOM    DAY

     KIRSTY, the daughter of Larry's first marriage, and
     his only child, on the 'phone.  She is barely twenty,
     beautiful in an unpretensious way: a dream of a girl-
     next-door.  We can't see much of the room she's in at
     the moment, the shot is too tight.

                             LARRY   (V.0.)
                Kirsty?

                             KIRSTY
                I got through.

                             LARRY   (V.O.)
                Where are you?

                             KIRSTY
                I found a room.


20   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY

                             LARRY
                       (on 'phone)
                What did you say?


21   INT.   KIRSTY'S ROOM   DAY

                             KIRSTY
                I said: I found a room.

     We begin to draw back from KIRSTY now, as she continues to
     speak to her father.  She's sitting on a battered chair
     by the door.  The room she's in is cramped and dirty.
     From outside, the sound of trains going by.

                             LARRY (V.0.)
                I thought you were going to
                stay with us for awhile?

                             KIRSTY
                       (pained)
                No Dad.

                             LARRY (V.0.)
                You'd like the house.

                             KIRSTY
                YOU'D like my room.

                             LARRY (V.0.)
                Do you want me to come over?

                             KIRSTY
                       (hastily)
                No, no.  Not just yet.  It
                needs ... er ... some work.

     That it does.  The place, now we've got a good view
     of it, is a total dump.

                             LARRY (V.0.)
                Well I want you to see the
                house.

                             KIRSTY
                I'm not going to change my
                mind, Dad.

     As she speaks she reaches forward to pull a picture,
     tacked to the wall, of a ourangoutang, with breasts
     collaged onto it, down.  She succeeds.  Beneath there's
     a large hole in the wall, which the picture was there
     to conceal.  Plaster falls from it.

                             KIRSTY
                       (mouths the word)
                Great.

                             LARRY (V.0.)
                Well come over, will you?
                See the place?

                             KIRSTY
                Maybe tomorrow.  I got to go
                look for a job.

                             LARRY (V.0.)
                O.K. Honey. Well you take care.
                I love you.

                             KIRSTY
                I love you too.

     She puts the receiver down.  As she does so the small
     table on which the 'phone is sitting collapses.  She
     covers her face with her hand.


22   INT.   HALLWAY OF LODOVICO STREET    DAY

     JULIA is three steps from the bottom of the stairs.

                             LARRY
                Well?

                             JULIA
                       (resigned)
                Why not?

                             LARRY
                       (smiles; he's pleased)
                We'll move in Sunday.


23   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY

     A church bell rings.  Off-screen, we hear voices:
     two men are attempting to move a bed into the house
     with LARRY masterminding the manoeuvres.  We HEAR
     their efforts, but we don't yet see them.  Our
     interest is in JULIA, who is unpacking a tea-chest
     in a room which is still full of draped furniture.

                             1ST MAN (O.S.)
                We're not going to get it in.

                             2ND MAN (O.S.)
                Tip it!  Tip it!

                             LARRY (O.S.)
                Wait!  Wait!  Watch the fucking
                paint work.

                             1ST MAN (O.S.)
                Look, do you want the bed in or
                not?

                             LARRY (0.S.)
                Just take it slowly.

                             1ST MAN (O.S.)
                Oh, sod you.

                             2ND MAN (O.S.)
                Eh, Chas, slow it down like
                the man says.

                             LARRY (O.S.)
                It'll go in.

                             1ST MAN
                Famous last fucking words.

     JULIA's face through this has been almost devoid of
     expression.  She's holding so many feelings inside;
     deep inside.  Now she moves from one box to another,
     and opens it to find it full of bathroom bric-a-brac.
     She picks it up and goes through into the hallway.

     The bell continues to ring.


24   INT.   HALLWAY    DAY

     The three sweating men have the bed wedged in the
     door.

                             LARRY
                       (not seeing Julia)
                Alright, let's give it another
                try.

                             2ND MAN
                       (sees Julia)
                Do you really need this bed, lady?

     LARRY turns.  Sees JULIA.

                             LARRY
                How are you doing through
                there?

                             JULIA
                It looks like a bomb's dropped.

                             2ND MAN 
                Got any beer?

                             JULIA
                There's some in the 'fridge.

     Nobody moves to get it.  Certainly JULIA has no
     intention of being waitress.  She goes to the bottom
     of the stairs.

                             LARRY
                I'll get it.

     LARRY disappears through into the kitchen.  JULIA
     starts up the stairs, watched appreciatively by the
     two men in the doorway.  One leans over and whispers
     to the other, who laughs.  JULIA glances back at
     them. The whisperer licks his lips; the meaning
     of the gesture perfectly apparent.  JULIA heads
     upstairs.


25   EXT.   NUMBER 55     DAY

     KIRSTY arrives at the head of the drive.  The two
     men are drinking beers.  The bed has not been moved.

     She wanders down the drive towards the house.


26   EXT.   DOORSTEP    DAY

                             2ND MAN
                       (seeing Kirsty)
                It's my lucky day.

                             KIRSTY 
                Hi.

                             2ND MAN
                Want to buy a bed?

                             KIRSTY
                Not much.

     She moves past them, attempting to insinuate herself
     between the bed and the door-jamb.  They watch,
     enjoying her efforts.


27   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

                             KIRSTY 
                Dad?

     LARRY emerges from one of the rooms, looking harassed.
     His face lightens as he sees his daughter.

                             LARRY
                Honey!

     They hug each other.

                             KIRSTY
                Big house.

                             LARRY
                You like?

                             KIRSTY
                Me like.

     Another hug.

                             LARRY
                I'll show you around when we've
                got this damn bed moved.

                             KIRSTY
                Is Julia here?

                             LARRY
                Upstairs.
                       (his voice lowers)
                Treat her gently, huh?  She
                hates moving.

                             KIRSTY
                       (dryly)
                Suprise.

                             LARRY
                       (a gently chiding
                        voice)
                Kirsty.

                             KIRSTY
                O.K.  I'll be nice.  You get
                on with the muscle work.  I'll
                make myself some coffee.

                             LARRY
                Kitchen's through on your left

     KIRSTY kisses LARRY, and goes through to the kitchen.
     LARRY turns back to the door.  The men have been
     watching KIRSTY.  LARRY clearly dislikes the scrutiny.
     1ST MAN, out-stared by LARRY, looks away.  The 2ND
     MAN is unperturbed.

                             2ND MAN
                That your daughter?

                             LARRY
                Uh-huh.

                             2ND MAN
                       (grins oafishly)
                Got her mother's looks.

                             LARRY
                Her mother's dead.

     2ND MAN's grin fades.

                             2ND MAN
                Oh.

                             LARRY
                Julia's my second wife.

                             2ND MAN
                       (weakly)
                Lucky man.

                             LARRY
                Damn right.  Now are we going
                to move the bed or not?


28   INT.   KITCHEN   DAY

     The kitchen is chaotic.  Cutlery, crockery, utensils,
     pans and foodstuffs have been heaped on every
     available surface.  KIRSTY has found the kettle,
     but is having difficulty turning on the tap.  She
     struggles with it.  No joy.  Just a rattling sound
     in the pipes as the system lurches into action.


29   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     The pipes rattle and chug behind the plaster.  The
     CAMERA moves along the corridor, hugging the wall.
     At the end of the corridor stands JULIA, in a
     patch of sunlight.  She has the photograph of FRANK
     in her hands.

     She looks intently at it.

     A CLOSE-UP of the photograph.  Then FRANK's voice.

                             FRANK
                Can I come in?

     JULIA looks up from the photograph.


30   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY

     A front door opens.  On the step of another house
     stands FRANK, with two suitcases.  It's raining
     outside; HARD.  The rain has plastered his hair to
     his scalp, which only emphasizes his raw good looks.
     He's unshaven; his eyes are dark, and intense.
     Again, the line she remembers:

                             FRANK
                Can I come in?

     The splash of rain on the step becomes a spurt of
     water, as we

                                            CUT BACK TO

     the present day.


31   INT.   KITCHEN   DAY

     The tap has come on suddenly, spraying KIRSTY with
     water.  She jumps back, soaked.

                             KIRSTY 
                Shit!  Shit!

     She reaches to turn the pressure down.


32   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

     The men are struggling with the bed again.

                             LARRY
                       (calls through)
                Are you O.K.?

                             KIRSTY
                       (from kitchen)
                Sure.


33   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     Again, JULIA returns her gaze to the photograph.


34   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY

     The same scene:  FRANK in the doorstep.  Now we

                                            CUT TO

     the person who opened the door.  It's JULIA; a younger
     JULIA, her hair arranged differently, her clothes
     brighter.  It is two weeks before her marriage to
     LARRY.  She looks at the man on the doorstep without
     a trace of recognition on her face.

                             FRANK
                You're Julia, right?

                             JULIA
                That's right.  Who are you?

                             FRANK
                       (a dazzling smile)
                I'm brother Frank.

                             JULIA
                       (smiles)
                Oh.

                             FRANK
                I came for the wedding.

     He looks at her, eyes glittering.  His hold on her
     is almost mesmeric.

     There is going to BE a wedding?

                             JULIA
                Oh.  Oh yes.

                             FRANK
                Well can I come in or not?

                             JULIA
                I'm sorry.  Of course.  You're
                very welcome.

     He steps inside.  Now he is close to her, rain running
     down his face.  We can hear his breath; sense the
     almost intimidating intimacy of his presence.

                             FRANK
                That's nice to know.
                       (pause)
                Have you got a towel?


35   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     JULIA stares down at the photograph.  Off scrren,
     KIRSTY's voice:

                             KIRSTY (O.S.)
                Have you got a towel?

     JULIA looks up.  At the top of the stairs, KIRSTY
     soaked from the tap.  JULIA looks up, and hurriedly
     pockets the photograph.

                             JULIA
                Kirsty.

                             KIRSTY
                Hi.  I got soaked.

                             JULIA
                There's a towel in the bath-
                room.

                             KIRSTY
                Which is where?

                             JULIA
                Just to your left.

     KIRSTY ducks into the bathroom.  We

                                            CUT BACK TO

     JULIA.  It's clear the memory of her first meeting
     with FRANK has affected her deeply.  The tears that
     threatened earlier are close.


36   INT.   BATHROOM   DAY

     KIRSTY has unbuttoned her blouse and is drying herself.

                             KIRSTY
                Did Dad tell you I got a room,
                by the way?  Waterloo.  Centre
                of the known universe.

     Silence from outside.

                Julia?

                       (she puts her head
                        out of the bathroom)


37   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     JULIA has gone.


38   INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY

     The door of the Torture Room is pushed open.  JULIA
     steps inside.


39   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     KIRSTY hears the creak of footsteps on the boards
     above.  JULIA's behaviour puzzles her, but she's
     not about to waste time thinking too hard about it.
     She starts downstairs again.


40   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     We have an odd, hovering point of view of JULIA,
     as she steps inside the room.  Something about the
     atmosphere distresses her.

     There is a scratching sound.  She looks down.  A
     wood-louse, recalling Frank's foresaken bed, crawls
     along the edge of the skirting board.  She crosses
     to the window, and tears away a little spy-hole
     in the aged newspaper.

     From downstairs, the voices of the bed-movers.

                             1ST MAN
                Have you got it?

                             2ND MAN
                I've got it.  I told you -

                             LARRY
                Wait!  Wait!

     The light through the window falls on her eye.
     The screen becomes a white-out, from which emerges:


41   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY

     A bedroom, with afternoon sunlight pouring between
     the slats of bamboo blinds.  Outside we can hear
     children playing summer games.  Inside, a fly buzzes.

     JULIA, the younger self, is holding her wedding
     dress in front of her, displaying it.

                             JULIA
                Well?

                             FRANK (0.S.)
                I don't want to see the dress.

                             JULIA
                But you said -

                             FRANK
                I don't want to see the dress.

     JULIA lets the dress drop a few inches in front
     of her.  She stares at FRANK.

                             FRANK
                You know what I want.

     Still she doesn't let the 'defence' that the dress
     offers - a reminder of her imminent marriage - fall.
     She stares though, and there's an invitation in her
     eyes.

                             FRANK
                I want you.

     Now we

                                            CUT TO

     FRANK.  He is not so beraggled as in the first scene,
     but the heat of the day has brought a sheen of sweat
     to his face.  Standing half in shadow he looks almost
     dangerous.

     Now JULIA lets the dress drop, putting it on the
     bed behind her.

                             FRANK
                That's better

     FRANK steps towards her.

                             JULIA
                What about Larry -

                             FRANK
                Forget him.

     FRANK takes hold of her.  She doesn't resist him,
     though there is barely disguised fear on her face.
     He puts his hand inside her blouse.


42   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     In extreme CLOSE UP, JULIA blinks into the light
     through the window, as LARRY's voice from downstairs
     calls her from her reverie.

                             LARRY
                Slowly, will you?  Slowly!

     Again, a white-CUT, from which emerges:


43   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY

     The two are naked on the bed, both sweating now.
     Beneath them, the wedding dress, crushed under their
     weight.

     Their love-making is not straight-forward: there is
     an element of erotic perversity in the way FRANK
     licks at her face, almost like an animal, his hold
     on her too tight to be loving.  The sequence
     escalates into a series of strange details from
     their locked bodies.  Nails digging into palms;
     sweat rivulets running down their torsoes.  And
     once in a while we see their faces.  JULIA watching
     FRANK, mesmerized and amused by his intensity;
     FRANK almost pained by his desire to push the
     experience TO THE LIMIT.  Their passion is rendered
     stranger still by the way the light through the window
     falls on their bodies, making striped creatures of them.

     At last, as their urgency increases, we move up
     until we're looking directly down on the bed.
     From here it is JULIA's face we can see, and the
     ecstasy of the moment has seized her.  Her arms
     are flung up over her head; her eyes are closed
     as she murmurs:

                             JULIA
                Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh
                my God.

     The scene whites out.


44   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     JULIA is still staring into the light.  She sobs, very
     quietly.

                             JULIA
                       (a whisper)
                Oh Frank ...


45   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

     Downstairs, LARRY and the men have moved the bed
     across the hall to the bottom of the stairs.

     All three are weary now, and getting careless.

     As they start up the stairs we see trouble ahead
     for LARRY, whose hand is moving closer and closer
     to a nail proturbing from the woodwork of the
     bannister.

                             LARRY
                       (to Movers)
                Will you take the weight while
                I take a step up?

     He backs towards the stairs - and the nail.

                Damn it, will you take the -

     The side of his hand is impaled bythe nail.  He cries
     out.  The weight of the bed, which he cannot relinquish,
     drives the nail deeper, and gouges a long cut from
     the ball of his thumb to his wrist.  Blood pours out.

                             LARRY
                Christ!

                             1ST MAN
                What's the problem?

                             LARRY
                My fucking hand!

     He drops his edge of the bed, and disengages his hand
     from the nail upon which he's injured himself.  He
     lifts his hand, from which blood is pouring.

                             LARRY
                You fucking ass-holes.

                             1ST MAN
                Who are you calling a fucking
                ass-hole?  It's this bastard
                bed that's your fucking problem!

     LARRY isn't listening.  He's looking at the wound
     in his hand.  He hates the sight of his own blood.
     Any moment, he may faint.

                             LARRY
                ... Oh Christ ...

     But not in front of these bastards.  He turns and
     starts up the stairs, groggier by the moment.

                             LARRY
                ... oh ... Christ ...


46   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     JULIA is standing in the middle of the room.  A single
     dart of light, through the hole she tore in the
     newspaper, strikes her face.  Softly on the soundtrack,
     the scrabbling noise of the woodlice.


47   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

     The bed has been put down.  1ST MAN and 2ND MAN are
     putting on their coats.  KIRSTY comes through from
     the kitchen.

                             KIRSTY
                What's happening?

                             2ND MAN
                We're leaving.

                             KIRSTY
                Where's my father?

                             1ST MAN
                He's fucked off.

                             2ND MAN
                       (mock chiding)
                Eh ... LANGUAGE.

                             1ST MAN
                Sorry.  He's gone upstairs.  So
                we're fucking off too.

     2ND MAN takes a sheet of paper from his jacket.

                             2ND MAN
                Will you sign for the bed?

                             KIRSTY
                Sure.


48   INT.   STAIRS   DAY

     LARRY, his hand running with blood, climbs the last
     flight of stairs.

                             LARRY
                       (weakly)
                ... Julia ...


49   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     JULIA hears him, and turns from her silent communing with
     the room.  She crosses towards the door.  Too late.
     It opens.  LARRY steps inside, blood pouring from
     his right hand, which he attempts to staunch with his
     left hand.

                             JULIA
                What have you done?

                             LARRY
                I cut myself.

     Blood has started to drip, unnoticed by either of them,
     onto the bare boards.  Heavy splashes.

     LARRY looks sick; his face clammy with sweat.  She stares
     at him without a trace of feeling for him on her face.

                             JULIA
                Is it deep?

                             LARRY
                I don't know, I haven't looked.
                You know me and blood.

                             JULIA
                You're NOT going to faint.

                             LARRY
                       (he leans againts
                        the wall)
                Shit.

                             JULIA
                Let me see.

     She goes to him.  He looks away as she unglues one hand
     from the other, and looks at the wound.  Blood comes faster,
     hitting the floor between them.

                             JULIA
                It's probably going to need
                stitches.

                             LARRY
                I'm going to throw up.

                             JULIA
                No, you're not.

     The blood keeps hitting the floor.  Slap; slap; slap.

                We'll get you out into the
                fresh air.

     He is again clamping his hand over the wound, as JULIA
     helps him to the door.  They leave the Torture Room.
     We hear their voices receding down the passageway,
     as we again assume that hovering view point.  The
     floor, is heavily spattered with blood.

                             JULIA
                Take it slowly.

                             LARRY
                So damn stupid.

                             JULIA
                You're done worse.

                             LARRY
                I'll be scarred for life.

                             JULIA
                No you won't.


50   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

     KIRSTY is half way up the stairs, as JULIA and LARRY
     head down.

                             KIRSTY
                What happened?

                             JULIA
                Just an accident.  He's all
                right.  Will you drive?  He
                needs stitches.

                             KIRSTY
                Sure.

                             JULIA
                The keys are in the kitchen.

     KIRSTY heads back to the kitchen.  JULIA helps LARRY
     towards the front door.

     The CAMERA swings away from them, upstairs, and
     begins to track ...

     LAP-DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY

     ... we continue to track, towards the Torture Room.

     Downstairs, the front door slams.

     LAP-DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     From outside, the sound of a car door slamming.  An
     engine starts.  The car drives away.

     We move towards the blood on the floor.  As we watch,
     it begins to disappear, as if being absorbed by the
     room.  We pan up to the wall.  The plaster is not
     quite smooth; indeed, it now begins to grow restless,
     and cracks.  Something begins to move in the wall ...


51   INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT

     An explosion of laughter.  We

                       CUT TO

     the remains of a rack of lamb, its gravy now congealed,
     scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there.
     This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a
     battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen.
     We pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and
     cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles.
     Finally, we reach JULIA, who is still sitting at the
     table, while the others have retired to more comfortable
     seats.  She looks utterly miserable, and a little
     drunk.

     The room has been spruced up for the party.  Candles
     are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are
     pictures on the walls.  But this is essentially
     cosmetic.  The place has not been refurnished or re-
     decorated.

     We move to the party guests.  Two, we recognize:
     KIRSTY, and LARRY - who is presently entertaining
     the gathering with an account of his accident.  The
     others are new faces.  An American couple:  BILL
     UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN, who are of an age with
     LARRY, and a younger, bespectacled man - a work
     colleague of LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL.  All are drunk.
     A brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and
     half a dozen other liquer bottles besides.  STEVE,
     it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on KIRSTY.

     LARRY is half-way through his hospital story,
     gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale,
     much to the pleasure of the rest.  His hand and
     lower arm are heavily bandaged.

                             LARRY
                - always hated the sight of my
                own blood.  I go out like a light.
                Anybody else's?  no problem.  But
                mine ... you know ... goes straight
                to my head.  Anyhow, this damn
                doctor's poking around and I'm
                saying: I'm going to pass out,
                and he's saying, no you're not, no
                you're not.  Next thing I know -

     We

                                            CUT BACK TO

     JULIA, who watches her husband, unamused.

                             LARRY
                - I wake up On the floor.

     Gales of laughter at this.

                And it was HIM who was looking
                sick.

                             BILL
                Probably thought you'd sue.

                             LARRY
                I should do it!

                             EVELYN
                Doctors -

                             LARRY
                I know.  And he's saying: I'm
                sorry.  I'm sorry.

                             BILL
                HE'S sorry.

                             LARRY
                Right ...
                       (he has picked up
                        the brandy bottle)
                Anyone for more?

                             EVELYN
                       (protests)
                No ... no ... I ...

                             LARRY
                Come on, you're only young once -

     LARRY fills up her glass.

                             LARRY
                       (to Kirsty)
                What are you drinking, love?

                             KIRSTY
                       (giggles)
                I've forgotten.

                             LARRY
                Steve?

                             STEVE
                We're on the Cointreau.

                             KIRSTY
                That's right.  Cointreau.

     STEVE picks up the bottle.

                             STEVE
                I'll do it.

     He fills up KIRSTY's glass.

                             KIRSTY
                I won't be able to stand.

                             STEVE
                So lie down.

     She casts him a sly glance.  He smiles.  She smiles.

     JULIA now stands up.

                             JULIA
                Would you excuse me?  I think
                I'm going to go to bed.

                             LARRY
                Are you O.K.?

     JULIA nods.

                             BILL
                       (looks at his watch)
                Christ.  I think it's time we
                were away -

     He stands.

                             LARRY
                Bill?  Absolutely not.  Sit
                down.  We've got celebrating
                to do.

     JULIA looks frosty, but LARRY does not catch the look.
     KIRSTY does however.  BILL sits down.

                             STEVE
                       (to Julia)
                It was a wonderful meal.

                             EVELYN
                       (gushing)
                Oh it was.  It was wonderful.

     There's a chorus of approval.  JULIA puts a smile on.

                             JULIA
                I'm glad you enjoyed it.

                             EVELYN
                See you again soon.

                             BILL
                You must come round.

                             EVELYN
                Yes.  You must.  We're so happy
                you're back.

                             JULIA
                       (at the door)
                That's nice.  Well ... goodnight.

     She exits, to a chorus of goodnights.  KIRSTY in
     particular watches her as she makes her exit.  JULIA's
     behaviour confounds her.  Meanwhile, the conversation
     has returned to LARRY's 'wound'.

                             EVELYN
                Does it still hurt?

                             LARRY
                Only when I laugh.

     This wins another round of laughter.


52   INT.   LOWER LANDING   NIGHT

     JULIA walks along the landing, while the laughter - muted
     by distance - wafts up from below.

     From the floor above, she hears something more.
     She stops, puzzled, then starts up the second flight
     of stairs towards the Torture Room.


53   INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

     She approaches the Torture Room, and steps inside.


54   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

     The sound of laughter is considerably dimmed in here;
     it's barely audible.  But there is another sound, a
     shifting sound in the corner of the room.

     She reaches for the light switch, and turns it on.
     The bulb's been broken however.  She stares around
     the room, trying to make sense of the shadows.

     Nervously, she approaches the wall, on which four
     streaks of light from the window fall.  Now she
     looks towards the window and realizes that the
     newspaper has been torn, as if by four fingers.  Her
     breath catches.  Suddenly, she's afraid.

     She stands absolutely still, eyes wide in the gloom.

                             JULIA
                Who's there?

     On the far side of the room, a movement in the shadows.

     JULIA almost retreats, but something keeps her staring
     into the murk, as SOMETHING - the remnants of a human
     form made of twisted, blistered strands of flesh,
     raises its head.  It's squatting against the wall,
     unable to lift itself into a standing position.  Its
     eyes, however, have life in them: and hunger. This,
     though he's unrecognizable, is FRANK.

                             FRANK
                       (a pained whisper)
                Julia.

                             JULIA
                Oh my God.

                             FRANK
                Don't look at me.

                             JULIA
                Who are you?

                             FRANK
                I said: don't look.

     She looks away.

                Help me.

                             JULIA
                Tell me who you are.

                             FRANK
                Frank.

     JULIA's face registers horror and disbelief.

                             JULIA
                No.  God no.

                             FRANK
                Believe me.  It's me.  It's
                really me.

                             JULIA
                What happened to you?

                             FRANK
                His blood ... on the floor ...
                It brought me back.

                             JULIA
                Back from where?

                             FRANK
                Just help, will you?  Please God,
                help me -

     From downstairs, dimly, laughter.


55   INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT

     LARRY has just told another story.  General drunken
     laughter.  KIRSTY stands up.

                             STEVE
                You're not going?

                             KIRSTY
                Just upstairs.

     She staggers a little bit.

                             STEVE
                Need any help?

                             KIRSTY
                I AM house-trained.

     Further hysteria.

                             STEVE
                       (covered in embarrass-
                        ment)
                No ... I meant ...

                             LARRY
                It's round on the left -

                             KIRSTY
                I know.

     She steps out into the hallway.


56   INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT

     She starts up the stairs.  She smiles to herself,
     thinking of STEVE.


57   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

     FRANK, in the corner of the room, watches JULIA, who is
     still at the door.

                             FRANK
                ... somebody ...

                             JULIA
                Ssh!

     The sound of KIRSTY downstairs, closing the bathroom
     door.

                             FRANK
                You can't let me stay like this.
                Please.  You can't.

                             JULIA
                What do you want me to do.

                             FRANK
                The blood brought me this far.
                I need more of the same.  Or
                I'll slip back ...

                                            CUT BACK TO

     JULIA's lace as she stares at FRANK once more.  She
     is appalled at the choice before her.

                             FRANK
                       (a plea)
                You have to heal me.


58   INT.   BATHROOM   NIGHT

     KIRSTY smiles at herself in the bathroom mirror, turns
     off the tap, opens the door and steps out onto the
     landing.


59   INT.   LOWER LANDING   NIGHT

     She takes a step along the landing, then realizes
     that there's somebody ahead of her, in the darkness.
     She stops.  From the floor above, a soft sigh.

                             KIRSTY
                Hello?

     JULIA moves out of shadow into a patch of patterned
     light splashing up the stair well.The effect recalls
     her memory of her lovemaking with FRANK.  The light
     makes her look strange; ominous.

                             KIRSTY
                Oh, it's you.

     JULIA doesn't smile

                Are you all right?

     Do we read murder in JULIA's eyes?  KIRSTY is uneasy.

     Suddenly, a voice from the floor below.

                             STEVE
                Kirsty?

     KIRSTY is relieved at the interruption.

                             KIRSTY
                       (calls down)
                I'm here.

                             STEVE
                I thought we'd lost you.

                             KIRSTY
                       (calls down)
                I'm coming!
                       (to Julia)
                Sleep well.

     JULIA is left on the landing, as KIRSTY heads downstairs.


60   EXT.   TUBE STATION   NIGHT

     The station is deserted, but for KIRSTY and STEVE,
     who are sitting, waiting for the last train.

                             KIRSTY
                You know I do know the way home.

                             STEVE
                It's late.

                             KIRSTY
                Not that late.

                             STEVE
                Please.  I want to see you
                home.  All right?

                             KIRSTY
                       (lightly)
                All right.
                       (smiles)
                No.  That's nice.

                             STEVE
                If there's a train.

                             KIRSTY
                What do we do if there isn't?

                             STEVE
                We walk.


61   EXT.   A PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL, NEAR WATERLOO   NIGHT

     KIRSTY and STEVE are walking.

                             STEVE
                Why don't you stay at Larry's
                house?  There's plenty of room.

                             KIRSTY
                Yeah, there's room.  And
                there's Julia.

                             STEVE
                I see.

                             KIRSTY
                She's so damn ... English.

                             STEVE
                Meaning what?

                             KIRSTY
                Oh, I don't know.  Up-tight.
                Frigid.

     STEVE stops walking.

                             STEVE
                I beg your pardon?

                             KIRSTY
                       (lightly)
                There ya go.
                       (imitates his tone)
                I beg your pardon?

                             STEVE
                We're not all frigid.

     KIRSTY has turned to look at him.  Both of them are
     aware where the banter is leading; smiles play on
     their faces as they speak.

                             KIRSTY
                Oh no?

                             STEVE
                Oh no.

                             KIRSTY
                It's not what I heard.

                             STEVE
                       (moves closer to
                        her)
                Well you've just been talking
                to the wrong people.

     He kisses her, with considerable feeling.


62   INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

     LARRY snores loudly.  JULIA lies beside him, wide
     awake, staring at the ceiling.

     LARRY turns over, muttering to himself.


63   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

     The door opens.  JULIA is standing there, in her
     night-gown.

     FRANK raises his wretched head.

                             FRANK
                Well?

     JULIA stares at the thing moving in the shadow.

                             JULIA
                Yes.


64   EXT.   NUMBER 55    DAY

     The door opens.   JULIA steps out of the house, and
     starts towards the street.      As she does so,
     she glances round.


65   EXT.   WINDOW OF TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     We approach the window, knowing that FRANK watches
     behind it.


66   EXT.   NUMBER 55   DAY

     JULIA heads off down the street.


67   INT.   PIZZA RESTAURANT   DAY

     The din of a lunchtime restaurant, with all the tables
     full, and everyone hungry.   In the middle of the
     melee, KIRSTY is valiantly trying to do six things
     at once.  Somebody wants their order taken;  somebody
     else wants more lager;  somebody else is complaining.
     She's doing her best, but losing the battle.  She
     serves a table with their food, and then starts back
     to pick up another order.   As she does so she's
     harangued from every side.

                             1ST CUSTOMER
                Excuse me, Miss -

                             2ND CUSTOMER
                I'd like some more lager.

                             1ST CUSTOMER
                Miss!

                             KIRSTY
                In a moment.

                             2ND CUSTOMER
                Did you hear me?

     KIRSTY starts back to the counter.  As she does so
     somebody else's voice cuts through the din.

                             STEVE
                Hey, sex-bomb -

     She wheels round.

                             KIRSTY
                You keep your -
                       (sees Steve)
                Oh.
                       (smiles)
                Hi.

                             STEVE
                I just called in.  How about
                tonight?

                             KIRSTY
                I don't finish till twelve.

                             STEVE
                I'm a late riser.

     He grins.  She grins.

                             2ND CUSTOMER
                What do you have to do to get
                some service around here?

                             STEVE
                Catch you later.


68   INT.  BAR    DAY

     By contrast, a quiet bar.   Discreet music;  a well-dressed
     clientele.  Several couples occupy booths.  Other solitary
     drinkers are at the bar.

     Amongst them:   JULIA.

     Now we see her more closely, we realize she's gone to some
     considerable effort to make herself ravishing.  There's
     nothing crude about the change;  it's a subtle transformation
     which shows off her considerable beauty.  She drinks soda
     water.

     She has an admirer.   Sitting alone at one of the tables
     is a middle-aged man by the name of PRUDHOE, a nervous,
     slightly paunchy individual.  She glances over at him. His
     eyes don't leave her for a moment.  He's trying his best
     to get the courage to approach her.

     She looks away, and concentrates on her drink.  Now she
     takes out a cigarette, fumbling for it. Her hands are
     trembling slightly.  She lights the cigarette, draws on
     it, and as she does so she seems to make up her mind that
     she's not the equal of it.  She stubs the cigarette out,
     puts cash on the bar for her drinks, and gets up to leave.

     Suddenly, PRUDHOE's at her side.

                             PRUDHOE
                Not much fun, is it?

                             JULIA
                What?

                             PRUDHOE
                Drinking alone.

                             JULIA
                Not much.

                             PRUDHOE
                I wonder, maybe ...

     He's so nervous he can barely speak.

                ... as we're both on our own ...
                we could have one drink together?

     JULIA looks at him.  He seems to almost be offering
     himself to her.   There's a long pause, while she tries
     to make up her mind. Then:

                             JULIA
                Why not?

     She smiles.   The smile works wonders.  PRUDHOE's nerves
     diminish somewhat.  JULIA's simply increase, now that
     she's committed herself.  Again, she opens the pack of
     cigarettes, as PRUDHOE calls the BARMAN over.

                             PRUDHOE
                       (to Julia)
                What are you drinking?

                             JULIA
                Just soda.

                             PRUDHOE
                Plain soda?

                             JULIA
                Please.

                             PRUDHOE
                I try not to drink at lunch-
                time.  Makes me sleepy in the
                afternoon.  You like to keep
                a clear head, eh?
                       (to Barman)
                One soda, one whisky.
                       (to Julia)
                I do it anyway.  No will-power.
                Got a busy afternoon?

                             JULIA
                       (looking straight
                        at him)
                That depends.

                             PRUDHOE
                Oh?

     He stares at her, not certain he interprets her correctly.
     She stares back.  Then: the tiniest of smiles, which he
     - scarcely believing his luck - returns.


69   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     The CAMERA moves across the room. We can hear FRANK's
     ragged breathing, and as we move in we see, on the floor
     beside him, the box - the Lament Configuration - its
     sides gleaming.  FRANK, still squatting on the floor,
     taps a tattoo on the bare boards with his skeletal fingers.

     Then, voices outside:  JULIA laughs.

     He raises his head.


70   EXT.  DOORSTEP   DAY

     JULIA opens the front door.  She is still very nervous,
     fumbling with the keys.  PRUDHOE stands a pace behind her.


71   INT.  HALLWAY   DAY

     They step inside.   JULIA closes the door

                             PRUDHOE
                You know it's not often I ...
                you know ...

                             JULIA
                There's a first time for every-
                thing.

                             PRUDHOE
                I suppose that's right.

                             JULIA
                You want something to drink?

                             PRUDHOE
                I'm already way over my usual
                limit.  You know, it's funny.
                I feel like I've known you for
                years.

     He approaches her:  his gestures made slightly clumsy by
     the alcohol he's drunk.  He kisses her.  She presses him off
     her.

                             PRUDHOE
                Oh, come on.
                       (he takes hold of
                        her breast)
                It's what you brought me here
                for, isn't it?

                             JULIA
                Yes.  I just think we'd be
                better off upstairs.

                             PRUDHOE
                Oh.  Oh fine.


72   INT.  TORTUPE ROOM    DAY

     FRANK's view, from the corner of the room.  We hear the
     sound of JULIA and PRUDHOE's approach up the stairs.

                             PRUDHOE
                This your place?

                             JULIA
                Let's not talk about it.

                             PRUDHOE
                No personal details, right?

                             JULIA
                Right.

                             PRUDHOE
                You know, you're incredible -

     JULIA opens the door.

                             JULIA
                Come on in.  Make yourself at
                home.

     She steps inside.  PRUDHOE does as he's instructed.  He
     stares at the bare floor, as JULIA closes the door behind
     him.

                             PRUDHOE
                There's no bed.

                             JULIA
                That's right.

                             PRUDHOE
                Huh?

                             JULIA
                I prefer the floor.

                             PRUDHOE
                First time for everything, right?

                             JULIA
                Right.

     JULIA moves towards him

                             JULIA
                Why don't you take off your jacket?
                You're warm.

                             PRUDHOE
                Yeah, why don't I?

     She slips the knot of his tie.  We can hear her pulse on
     the soundtrack.  She glances over PRUDHOE's shoulder.  He
     follows her gaze, but she diverts him with a peck on the
     cheek.

                             PRUDHOE
                       (takes over his
                       undressing)
                Why don't you do the same?

                             JULIA
                Maybe I will.

     PRUDHOE, now starts to shed his jacket and trousers, trying
     not to take his eyes off JULIA for an instant.

     We watch from FRANK'S P.O.V. as he drops his underwear.
     He still wears his shirt, which he starts to unbutton.
     We move back into a tighter shot.

                             PRUDHOE
                       (voice slightly slurred)
                You know, you're very beautiful.

                             JULIA
                Am I?

                             PRUDHOE
                You know you are.  Loveliest
                woman I ever set eyes on.

     JULIA smiles.

     PRUDHOE stops unbuttoning his shirt.

                             PRUDHOE
                Oh Christ.

                             JULIA
                What's wrong?

                             PRUDHOE
                Too much drink.  Better empty
                my bladder.

     She steps out of the way so that he can cross to the door.

                             PRUDHOE
                I'll be a moment.

     As he moves to the door, she throws a piece of cloth off
     a hammer, which lies beside the wall.  PRUDHOE takes
     hold of the door handle.  Turns it:  it's stuck.

                             PRUDHOE
                The door's stuck.

     Before he can turn she hits him on the back of the head.
     He doesn't fall, but the blow sends blood down the back
     of his shirt.   To avoid the following blow he stumbles
     blindly towards the wall but JULIA's not going to be
     stopped now.  He holds the back of his head - dazed,
     apologetic, pitiful - while she moves towards him.

                             PRUDHOE
                Don't ... I ... please ...
                I'm sorry ...

     She eclipses him.

                ... I'm so sorry ...

     She raises the hammer.

                ... I don't understand ...

     She strikes him.  He slides down the wall, his jaw
     broken, blood pouring from his face.   He twitches.  Then
     the twitches stop.

     She drops the hammer, and stares down at the corpse.

                             JULIA
                Enough?

     The room sighs.   In the corner, FRANK's shadowy form
     leans forward.

                             FRANK
                Don't look at me.

     JULIA backs towards the door, as the broken, skeletal
     form crawls out of darkness to claim its sustenance.


73   INT.  UPPER LANDING    DAY

     JULIA steps out onto the landing and leans against the
     wall, waves of sheer relief breaking over her.

     In the room behind her, terrible sounds of feeding.


74   INT.  BATHROOM    DAY

     JULIA steps into the bathroom, and looks at herself in
     the mirror.   Blood is spattered on her face;  her hands
     are similarly stained.  She is trembling from head to
     foot.

     Stripping off her blouse, and flinging it over the side
     of the bath, she douses her face, neck and breasts with
     cold water.  Then she stares up at her face again,
     examining it.  She can scarcely believe what she's done.


75   INT.  LOWER LANDING    DAY

     She crosses the landing and climbs the stairs to the
     Torture Room.


76   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     She opens the door.

     As she does so FRANK retreats into the shadows.  We are
     granted a fleeting glimpse of him, his body fuller than
     before, but still horribly vulnerable.

     JULIA looks at PRUDHOE's corpse.  A trail of blood leads
     away from it into the darkness.  The body itself is a
     grotesquely misshapen husk now, the muscle and fat
     withered, the eyes sunk into the skull, the lips drawn
     back to expose the gums. A ghostly sight.

                             JULIA
                Jesus Christ.

     JULIA looks across at FRANK, who is no longer sitting,
     but standing in the shadows.

                             FRANK
                       (his voice stronger)
                Do I disgust you?

     She doesn't reply.

     He stretches his arm into a passage of light.  His flesh
     glistens and pulses.

                             FRANK
                See?   It's making me whole
                again.

     He turns his arm over for her appreciation.

                Every drop of blood you spill
                puts more flesh on my bones.
                And we both want that don't
                we?

     She nods.

                Good.  Come here.

     She stares, unable to move.

                Come here, damn you.  I want
                to touch you ...

     Still she doesn't move.

                             FRANK
                       (more softly)
                Come to Daddy.  I only want to
                touch ...

     She takes a step towards his outstretched arm.   His
     fingers touch her face.  She steels herself against them.
     Now, he starts to trace the line of her jaw, stroking
     her.  Now her lips, caressingly.

     Suddenly, a sound from downstairs.  The front door is
     opened.

                             LARRY
                       (from below)
                Sweetheart?

     JULIA withdraws from his touch

                             LARRY
                       (from below)
                Where are you?


77   INT.  HALLWAY    DAY

     Shot from the stairs of LARRY.  He looks up the flight.
     He takes a step towards the stairs.


78   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     JULIA takes a step backwards, her foot hitting PRUDHOE's
     corpse.


79   INT.  HALLWAY   DAY

     LARRY is still at the bottom of the stairs.

                             LARRY
                Are you there?

     For a moment it looks as though he's going to climb the
     stairs, then he thinks better of it, and goes through
     to the back of the house.


80   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     JULIA has wrapped the corpse of PRUDHOE up in its clothes
     and is now lifting it.  The body is lighter now, having
     been drained of nourishment.  Its head lolls back and its
     dentures drop out, hitting the floor loudly.  She freezes.
     No sound from below.  She backs out of the room with her
     burden.

     FRANK's arm reaches for the fallen dentures and peers at
     them.

                             FRANK
                Who's a pretty boy then?

     Soft laughter from the darkness.


81   INT.  JUNK ROOM    DAY

     JULIA pushes the door of the Junk Room, which is on the
     upper landing, open.  Inside, a chaos of tea-chests and
     bric-a-brac.  She lays the body down.


82   INT.  KITCHEN    DAY

     LARRY has come through to look for JULIA.  He hears a
     noise above.   He looks up.

                             LARRY
                       (quietly)
                Julia?

     He leaves the kitchen.


83   INT.  HALLWAY     DAY

     Again, LARRY Steps into the hallway, and gazes up the
     stairs.

                             LARRY
                Are you there?

     He starts up.


84   INT.  LOWER LANDING    DAY

     JULIA steps into the bathroom, and then locks the door
     behind her.

     LARRY ascends to the top of the stairs.

                             LARRY
                Julia?

                             JULIA
                       (from bathroom)
                I'm here.

                             LARRY
                       (at the door)
                Sweetheart ... I've been
                calling you.

     He tries the door.  It's locked.

                Are you all right?

                             JULIA
                Just feeling a bit sick.

                             LARRY
                Oh, babe ...


85   INT.  BATHROOM    DAY

     JULIA, still trembling, sits on the edge of the bath.

                             JULIA
                I'll be O.K.  Just leave me
                be a while.

                             LARRY
                Can I get you anything?

                             JULIA
                Maybe a brandy.

                             LARRY
                Sure.

                             JULIA
                I'll be down in a minute

                             LARRY
                O.K.

     She listens as his footsteps recede down the landing and
     stairs.    Then she crosses to the mirror and tries to
     erase the signs of panic.  She puts a comb through her
     hair, and adjusts her blouse.  That done, she unbolts the
     door and steps out into the landing.  She doesn't go down
     however, but UP,  back to the Torture Room.


86   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     She opens the door.

                             JULIA
                       (very softly)
                Frank?

     A crunching sound in the shadows.  FRANK's hand opens,
     dropping the pieces of PRUDHOE's dentures, which he has
     crushed, onto the floor, in a rain of plastic teeth.

                             FRANK
                I'm hurting

                             JULIA
                Hurting.

                             FRANK
                My nerves ... are beginning
                to work again.

                             JULIA
                Good.

                             FRANK
                One more.  Maybe two -

     JULIA's face registers no horrer at this.

                - to heal me completely.   Then
                we can be away from here, before
                they come looking.

                             JULIA
                Who?

                             FRANK
                The Cenobites.  It's only a matter
                of time before they find I've
                slipped them. I have to get away
                from here.

     From downstairs, LARRY.

                             LARRY
                Julia?   Are you all right?

     JULIA crosses to the door and calls down.

                             JULIA
                Just a moment.  Put on some
                music will you babe?

                             LARRY
                O.K.

     She returns to her conversation with FRANK.

                             FRANK
                Poor Larry.  Obedient as ever.

                             JULIA
                Keep your voice down.

     She crosses to close the door.   When she turns round,
     he's in front of her, silhouetted against the window,
     his half-formed face terrifying in the gloom.  Suddenly
     he reaches out and catches hold of her arm.  She gasps
     in pain.

                             FRANK
                Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.

                             JULIA
                You're hurting.

                             FRANK
                You won't cheat me will you?
                You'll stay with me.  Help me.
                Then we can be together, the
                way we were before.  We belong
                to each other now, for better
                or worse ...

     He lets go of her.

                ... like love.  Only real.

     She goes to the door, and leaves him, locking it behind
     her.

     We move close to FRANK's face.   He licks his skinned
     lips with a bloody tongue.  Thunder rolls.


87   KIRSTY'S DREAM

     The thunder carries over to a dream.

     We are in the Dining Room of Number 55, except that
     everything is once more shrounded in sheets.

     We CUT to KIRSTY, moving through the room, her face pale,
     her hair glued to her forehead with sweat.

     Somewhere, a bell is ringing.  Flies buzz.  On the
     dinner table, a form is covered in a sheet.  It's clear
     that the shape is human.  She reaches the table, and
     looks at the body.

     Suddenly, blood begins to seep through the shroud, beginning
     at the head - eyes and mouth - then spreading across the
     body.  There are sobs beneath the shroud.

     She reaches for it, to snatch it off the body.

     The blood has almost turned the sheet scarlet.

     She pulls.

     We glimpse only a moment of what'd beneath: a naked
     body, scarlet and shining with blood from head to foot.

     She screams.

     Her scream becomes louder, as we

                                               CUT TO

88   INT.  KIRSTY'S ROOM    NIGHT

     STEVE sits bolt upright in bed, while KIRSTY yells.

     The sheet is snatched off him.  He looks across the room
     to see KIRSTY at the end of the bed, with the sheet in
     her hand.

                             STEVE
                What are you doing?

     KIRSTY's eyes are still closed.

                Kirsty!

     Her eyes open.  She looks down at the sheet she's snatched
     from the bed, and drops it in horror.

                             STEVE
                Christ.  What was that about?

     KIRSTY, weak with fear, just shakes her head.


89   INT.  HALLWAY, NUMBER 55    NIGHT

     A phone is ringing.

     LARRY crosses the hallway, bleary-eyed, and disappears
     from sight.   The phone is picked up.

                             LARRY'S VOICE
                Hello?


90   INT.  BEDROOM    NIGHT

     JULIA lies in bed, the pillow empty beside her.   She's
     wide awake, staring at the ceiling.   Downstairs, the
     murmur of LARRY's voice.


91   INT.  TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

     FRANK stands in the corner of the room, breathing softly
     in the shadows.


92   INT.  TELEPHONE ROOM   NIGHT

     LARRY is on the phone.

                             LARRY
                I'm O.K., honey.  It's all
                right ...


93   INT.  KIRSTY'S ROOM    NIGHT

     KIRSTY is on the phone.   STEVE sits up in bed, having
     reclaimed the sheet.

                             KIRSTY
                I just wanted to be sure you
                were O.K.


94   INT.  TELEPHONE ROOM    NIGHT

                             LARRY
                Never better.  You sleep well.

                             KIRSTY (on phone)
                Yeah.

                             LARRY
                I love you, honey.

                             KIRSTY (on phone)
                I love you too.

     LARRY puts down the phone.


95   INT.  LOWER LANDING    DAY

     LARRY returns to the bedroom.

                             JULIA (O.S.)
                Who was it?

                             LARRY
                Kirsty.

     He goes into the bedroom.

     We PAN up the second flight of stairs.

     FRANK is sitting at the top, in the shadows.

                             FRANK
                       (soft as a breath)
                Kirsty.


96   INT.  HALLWAY    DAY

     The front door is closed by JULIA.   A man stands in
     the hallway:  another VICTIM.   He is as nervous as
     PRUDHOE.

                             VICTIM
                You're sure we're not going to
                be interrupted -

                             JULIA
                Quite sure.

                             VICTIM
                Only I like to be careful.


97   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     A shock CUT to the naked VICTIM, thrown back against
     the wall from JULIA's hammer blow.  Before he can even
     slide down the wall, FRANK is upon him.

     We don't linger, but CUT away to:


98   INT.  LANDING    DAY

     As JULIA closes the door, her face devoid of emotion,
     we see the VICTIM's body on the floor, with FRANK's
     hands oh its head, draining out its energies.


99   INT.  DINING ROOM    DAY

     JULIA sits, sipping a drink, her face still unreadable.


100  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     FRANK is standing in the shadows.  The VICTIM's body
     is in the middle of the room.

     JULIA enters.

                             JULIA
                Well?

                             FRANK
                Better.  Much better.  I'd
                like some clothes.  And maybe
                a cigarette.

                             JULIA
                Then you tell me ... you
                explain what happened to you?

                             FRANK
                Of course.


101  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     We pan across the walls as FRANK speaks.

                             FRANK (O.S.)
                I wanted access to experiences ...
                pleasures ... that only they
                could offer ...

                             JULIA (O.S.)
                The Cenobites.

                             FRANK
                That's what they call themselves.
                They're not human.  Maybe they
                were once, but they're not now.
                They rearrange their own flesh
                for pleasure.

     We've moved across to FRANK now.  He is dressed,
     in loose fitting jacket and trousers, through which
     his blood is seeping.  He smokes, taking great
     pleasure in the experience.

                             JULIA
                And the box?

     FRANK picks up the box.  Vague, tantalizing forms
     move over the surface, like ghosts.

                             FRANK
                It cost me a fortune.  All I
                had.  It's a puzzle you see.
                You solve it, and the Cenobites
                come through ...

                             JULIA
                Where from?

                             FRANK
                God knows.  Sometimes I think
                they're just behind the walls ...

     He turns the box over.  The lacquer catches the light.

                             JULIA
                So they cheated you

     In the lacquer we see oiled bodies moving.  It's
     difficult to be sure what the forms signify.  Is
     this torture, or some elaborate pleasure?

                             FRANK
                Oh no.  They kept to their
                bargain.  They gave me
                experiences I'd never forget ...

     The images in the lacquer are becoming clearer, and
     they are APPALLING.  Flesh torn open; blood running
     across sweating flesh; hooks, and terrible machines.

                             FRANK
                But their pleasure was my pain.

     His voice has begun to tremble.  The images in the
     box are more horrific by the moment.  And flowing
     between them, highly distorted, the CENOBITE's
     faces, and that of FRANK, screaming and screaming.

                             FRANK
                Terrible pain.  Appalling ...

     He can't speak for a moment.  After a pause, he goes
     on, his voice heavy.

                My body was forfeit.  But my
                spirit ... they left that here.
                In the boards.  In the walls.
                Watching the world, but never
                able to touch it ...

                             JULIA
                And the blood let you out?

                             FRANK
                There are ways to resurrection.
                Blood's one of them.  I won't
                let them take me back, Julia.

     JULIA looks at the horrors in the box, and understands
     his desire.

                             FRANK
                I want to be whole, and then
                get out -

     He lifts the box up.

                I won't let them take me.

                             JULIA
                You won't have to.  We'll be
                gone.  Somewhere they'll
                never find us.

     There's a rumble of thunder.

                Not in the whole wide world.


102  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT

     More thunder, and the sound of heavy rain against the
     windows.

     The television is on.  LARRY and JULIA are sitting on
     the couch.  LARRY is watching a boxing match.  He
     has consumed several beers:  the cans are beside
     his feet; and there's another in his hand.

     JULIA reads a magazine, glancing up at the screen
     to see the match getting more heated.  Blood is
     starting to flow.

                             LARRY
                Is this upsetting you?

                             JULIA
                I've seen worse.

     LARRY looks at her.

                             LARRY
                Are you all right?

                             JULIA
                Fine.

                             LARRY
                Only I'll turn it off -

     There's a sudden raising of shouts from the screen,
     as one of the boxers hits the canvas.  LARRY
     turns his attention back to the match.

                             COMMENTATOR
                And he's down!  He's down!

     The thunder rolls on.


103  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

     The lightning finds its way through the holes in
     the newspaper.  FRANK is watching through the window,
     his face occasionally washed with light.  His hand,
     on the window frame, taps out the same tattoo he's
     tapped out before.  He turns away from the window,
     and his foot catches the box.  It rolls across the
     floor.


104  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT

     The boxing match is heating up again.

                             COMMENTATOR
                - and now he's in trouble,
                he's really in trouble - 

                             LARRY
                What was that?

     JULIA looks up from her magazine.

                             JULIA
                Thunder.

     The violence on the screen is horrific, as swollen
     faces burst beneath punches.

                             LARRY
                No.  Something else.

     LARRY stands up.

                             JULIA
                Maybe I left a window open -

     She gets up and crosses to the door.

                - I'll go see.

                             LARRY
                No.  I'll do it.

     He opens the door, and steps out into the hallway.


105  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

     In such tight close up we can't sec that FRANK has
     in fact left the Torture Room, we see his features
     register that somebody is coming.


106  INT.   STAIRWAY   NIGHT

     LARRY is climbing the stairs.  JULIA follows.

                             JULIA
                It was nothing.

     LARRY has reached the top of the stairs.  He looks up
     the next flight.

                Larry ...

                             LARRY
                What's wrong with you?

     She's desperate to stop him climbing to the Torture
     Room.

                             JULIA
                I just hate the thunder.

     He crosses to her.

                             LARRY
                I'm here.

     He puts his arms around her.  She responds.

                You're shaking.

     He hugs her tight, kissing her lightly. The thunder
     shakes the house.

                There's nothing to be afraid
                of.

     He kisses her neck, his hands restless on her.

                I'll just go check upstairs ...

     He kisses her again.  She, in order to distract him,
     kisses him back.  Her passion is artificial, but he
     doesn't register that.

                             LARRY
                Oh baby.

                             JULIA
                Don't go upstairs.

                             LARRY
                Come with me then.

     He starts up the stairs.

                             JULIA
                Please ...


107  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

     He reaches the top of the stairs.  First he throws
     open the Junk Room.  Lightning flashes on boxes
     inside.  Then he moves towards the Torture Room.
     The thunder rolls more loudly.

     She follows him along the landing, desperate to stop
     him.

     Too late.  He throws open the door.

                             JULIA
                Don't.

     Lightning floods the room.  It's empty.  She stands
     beside him at the door.

                             LARRY
                We must have rats.

     She looks back down the stairs.  Where's FRANK gone?
     LARRY turns to her, holding her again, on the
     threshold of the Torture Room.

                             LARRY
                See?  Quite safe.

     He kisses her, much harder this time; a sexual kiss.

                Let's go  down.  I'll make it
                better.

     He kisses her again.


108  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

     A shadow moves across the screen as the door opens,
     and LARRY puts on the light. He has hold of JULIA's
     hand.  He leads her inside.  She sits on the bed,
     illuminated by the light from the landing, and the
     occasional flicker from the window.  LARRY kneels
     between her legs, and kisses her breasts, his eyes
     closed.

     JULIA glances into the shadows of the room.  She
     senses FRANK's presence.

                             LARRY
                ... oh babe ...

     He starts to unbutton her dress.  She's distracted
     by her suspicions; he has his hands against her
     almost before she realizes what's happening.

     We have her P.O.V. as she looks around the room.  The
     dressing table; the wardrobe; the curtains at the
     window.  Does something move in the shadows?

     A flash of lightning.  No.  There's nothing.

     LARRY gets onto the bed and draws her against him,
     kissing her.  This is not the intense, slightly
     dangerous love-making she experienced with FRANK,
     but a fumbling, slightly foolish exchange.  LARRY is
     so wrapped in attempting to make the right moves he
     doesn't register the fact that JULIA's attention is
     elsewhere.

     Now we have a P.O.V. from the far side of the room, of
     the two figures on the bed, the only sound the thunder
     and LARRY's murmured words of seduction, which we
     can barely make out.

                             LARRY
                ...I love you, honey ... let
                me ... oh God ... I love you ...

     Neither of them have undressed fully; there's just a
     tangle of clothes around them which removes any trace
     of eroticism from the scene.

     A CLOSE UP of JULIA's head, laid on the pillow, shows
     just how uninvolved she is - while LARRY works, eyes
     closed.  JULIA looks down the length of her husband's
     body.  The door of the wardrobe swings open.  FRANK
     is watching.  She registers horror.  LARRY is oblivious
     to all of this, of course.

     We have a CLOSE UP of FRANK watching the love-making.
     Now he steps out of the wardrobe.  JULIA makes a moan
     of horror, which LARRY takes as enthusiasm.

                             LARRY
                Oh baby ... I love you ...

     From JULIA'S P.O.V., we see the form of FRANK shamble
     towards the lovers.

     From FRANK'S P.O.V. we see the lovers on the bed,
     LARRY's back vunerable.  JULIA seems to realize what
     he intends.

                             JULIA
                ... no ...

     LARRY barely hears her.

     FRANK is at the very end of the bed now, and JULIA
     becomes highly agitated.

                             JULIA
                No.  No, you mustn't.  PLEASE.
                No.

     LARRY stops his love-making.

                             LARRY
                       (looks at her)
                Huh?

                             JULIA
                Please ...

                             LARRY
                What's wrong with you?

                             JULIA
                       (almost sobbing)
                Please.  I can't bear it ...

     LARRY is angered and utterly perplexed at this.  He
     disengages his arms from around her.

     JULIA'S P.O.V., as FRANK retreats.

     LARRY rolls off JULIA.

     The wardrobe door closes.  Click.

                             LARRY
                I don't understand you.  One
                moment you're all over me, the
                next it's:  Don't touch me.

     He sits on the edge of the bed.

                I just don't understand.

     He gets up and leaves the bedroom.  JULIA remains where
     she is.  We have a shot of the bed, and her upon it,
     from FRANK's end of the room.  She stares at the
     wardrobe.  Through the crack of the open door, FRANK
     stares back.  A flicker of lightning illuminates his
     face; his skeletal grin.

     Softly, beneath the assault of the rain on the roof,
     we hear laughter.


109  INT.   A SMALL RESTAURANT   EVENING

     KIRSTY and LARRY are sitting eating a meal together,
     in an intimate restaurant.  LARRY has little appetite,
     to judge by his plate.  He looks as if he hasn't slept
     for several nights.  KIRSTY, by contrast, is sparkling

                             LARRY
                ... maybe we should never
                have come back.

                             KIRSTY
                Maybe you should give it some
                time.

                             LARRY
                I guess.

                             KIRSTY
                       (skirting her real
                       feelings)
                She's not like Mom.  She's ...
                I don't know ... moody.  I thought
                that was what you liked about her.

                             LARRY
                You don't like her at all do you?

     The straight-forward question silences KIRSTY for a
     moment.  She wants to be delicate with her father's
     feelings, but honest at the same time.

                             KIRSTY
                I don't know her.  She's so ...
                sealed up.

     LARRY's face is full of the desire for reassurance.
     KIRSTY tries to offer it.

                If YOU love her she must be
                worth loving.  Just give me
                some time.

     LARRY nods, a weak smile on his face

                             LARRY
                She doesn't even want to leave
                the house.

                             KIRSTY
                Really?

                             LARRY
                It's like she's waiting for
                something.

                             KIRSTY
                What?

                             LARRY
                I don't know.  I don't know.
                It's beyond me.

     A silence.

                             LARRY
                       (hesitant)
                Would you ... maybe call round
                sometime?  Try to make friends.

                             KIRSTY
                Sure.

                             LARRY
                Maybe all she needs is some
                company.


110  INT.   STAIRCASE   DAY

     FRANK is standing at the top of the stairs, dressed in
     his stained suit.  JULIA is a few steps down, staring
     up at him.

                             FRANK
                You can't love him.

                             JULIA
                I don't.

                             FRANK
                So where's the harm?

                             JULIA
                I said no.

                             FRANK
                Then find me somebody else, 
                before they come looking.

     JULIA nods.

                Tomorrow?

     She looks at him.


111  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET - DAY

     A wind blows, carrying autumn leaves before it.  And
     on the wind, the distant pealing of bells.


112  EXT.   DOORSTEP OF NUMBER 55   DAY

     JULIA is at the door, turning the key in the lock.
     Beside her, a third sacrificial lamb, balding and
     excitable.  His name is SYKES.

     JULIA opens the door.


113  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   DAY

     At the corner of the street now:  KIRSTY.  She watches,
     puzzled.


114   EXT.   DOORSTEP OF NUMBER 55   DAY

     A long shot of the house, from KIRSTY'S P.O.V.  The
     man on the step seems to having second thoughts.
     JULIA speaks with him.  We can hear none of this
     exchange, but JULIA manages to coax him inside.  She
     closes the door behind them.


115  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   DAY

     KIRSTY stands, bewildered by what she's seen.


116  INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     From the top of the stairs we watch JULIA lead SYKES
     upstairs.

                             SYKES
                I get lonely sometimes.

                             JULIA
                Everybody does.


117  EXT.   STREET   DAY

     KIRSTY starts towards the house.


118  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     In the corner of the room FRANK stands, tapping out
     the rhythm with his fingers.  It's 'Colonel Bogey',
     and now he hums it too.  Outside the door, a footfall.

                             JULIA
                Come in.

     The humming stops.

     JULIA opens the door.


119  EXT.   FRONT OF HOUSE   DAY

     KIRSTY starts down the path.


120  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     SYKES is looking at JULIA.

                             SYKES
                What is this?  A game?

     FRANK moves in the corner.  SYKES catches the motion
     from the corner of his eye.  He turns.

                What ?

     FRANK steps from the shadows.

                Jesus Christ.

     JULIA hits him with the hammer.


121  EXT.   DOORSTEP   DAY

     KIRSTY hears SYKES scream.  She freezes.  Then steps
     back from the doorstep and looks up at the house.


122  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     In the Room, pandemonium.  SYKES, blood pouring down
     his face, flails out at JULIA.  The hammer flies from
     her hand.  He lunges for the door, but she manages
     to kick it closed.

                             SYKES
                Christ help me!


123  EXT.   HOUSE   DAY

     KIRSTY makes her way around the back of the house.


124  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     SYKES has taken hold of JULIA, and is using her as
     a shield against FRANK, whos is bearing down upon
     him.  For the first time we see FRANK's true colours
     where JULIA's concerned -

                             SYKES
                       (to Frank)
                Don't!

     Casually, FRANK throws JULIA aside.  She falls, sobbing.

     FRANK descends on SYKES.

                             SYKES
                No!


125  INT.   KITCHEN   DAY

     SYKES' scream covers the sound of KIRSTY forcing the
     back door open.  She steps inside.


126  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     FRANK has SYKES face to the wall.  SYKES is sobbing now.
     The room is covered in blood.

                             FRANK
                       (to Julia)
                Get out of here.

     She picks herself up.

                             SYKES
                       (to Julia)
                Please ... don't let him kill
                me ... please ...

     JULIA leaves, closing the door.

     FRANK seizes hold of SYKE's neck, his fingers entering
     the flesh either side of his neck vertebrae.  SYKES screams.


127  INT.   KITCHEN/DINGING ROOM/HALLWAY   DAY

     KIRSTY moves through the house, and starts to climb the
     stairs.


128  INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     Half way up the stairs, the scream stops.  She climbs
     the rest of the way surrounded by a graveyard hush.


129  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     A soundless, slowed shot, as SYKES, his face wasted
     by FRANK's feeding, breaks from FRANK's hold and
     lunges for the door.


130  INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     KIRSTY starts up the second flight of stairs.


131  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     The same slowed, soundless horror, as SYKES reaches
     the door.  FRANK is a pace behind him.


132  INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY

     KIRSTY reaches the top as -


133  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     The door from inside the room.  SYKES pulls it open -


134  INT.   TORTURE ROOM FROM LANDING   DAY

     In real time, and accompanied by the most horrific
     shriek, SYKES flings himself from the Torture Room.
     The flesh is hanging off his face; his eyes bulge
     in terror.

     Seeing KIRSTY he starts towards her.  Behind him,
     FRANK, his body glistening.  He catches hold of SYKES
     by the neck. SYKES'  shrieks stop.  The eyes glaze
     over.  The body judders as death claims it.  Then
     FRANK drops the corpse, and looks up at KIRSTY.

                             KIRSTY
                Oh my God.

     She starts to back away down the stairs.

                             KIRSTY
                       (shouts)
                Julia!

                             FRANK
                Kirsty?

     He takes a step towards her.

                             KIRSTY
                Keep your fucking distance.
                Julia!  Where's Julia?  Christ,
                what have you done with her.

     She's still backing away. He's still advancing.

                             FRANK
                Kirsty.  It's Frank.  It's
                Uncle Frank.

                             KIRSTY
                No.

                             FRANK
                You remember.

                             KIRSTY
                No.

                             FRANK
                Come to Daddy.

     Her puzzlement, however, has slowed her retreat, 
     and now FRANK reaches for her.  At the last moment
     she backs away again, but he's after her in a beat,
     and seizes hold of her.

                             KIRSTY
                No.  Get the fuck off me.

     He drags her back up the stairs.


135  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     He pushes her ahead of him, into the Torture Room.  He
     closes the door.

                             FRANK
                You've grown.  You're beautiful.

     She has retreated as far from him as she can get.  He
     advances on her.

                             KIRSTY
                Don't touch me.  Or so help
                me -

                             FRANK
                What?  What will you do?  What
                can you do?
                       (pause)
                There's nothing to be frightened
                of.

     FRANK has closed in on her by now.  He Lakes hold
     of her face.

                             FRANK
                I bet you make your Daddy proud,
                don't you?  Beautiful.

                             KIRSTY
                This isn't happening.

                             FRANK
                I used to tell myself that.
                Used to try and pretend I was
                dreaming all the pain.  But why
                kid yourself?  Some things have
                to be endured.  Take it from me.
                And that makes the pleasures so
                much sweeter ...

     As he leans in to kiss her she snatches hold of the
     pus and bloodstained shirt that's glued to his
     abdomen, and PULLS.  There's a flow of fluids.
     FRANK's head is thrown back, and he screams.
     She slips from beneath his grasp.  But he's after
     her in a moment, his hand catching her blouse.  It
     tears.  His fingers rake her bare skin.

     She stumbles, reaches out for the wall, which is
     slick with SYKES' blood.  Her hand slides over
     it.  She falls, heavily.

     Roaring, FRANK comes in pursuit of her.

     On the floor in front of KIRSTY:  the box.  It's a
     poor weapon, but it's all she's got.  As he comes
     after her again, she stands up and delivers a blow
     to his head with the box.  He howls.  She races for
     the door.  But he's after her.  He strikes her.
     She's thrown against the wall.  He's FURIOUS now.
     Strikes her again.  She cannot survive much more.

     She raises the box to retaliate.   FRANK sees what
     she's holding.  His  attack stops.

                             FRANK
                Give that to me.

     She dimly realizes that she has a bargaining tool.

                             KIRSTY
                       (breathless)
                No.

                             FRANK
                One last time.  Give me the
                box.

                             KIRSTY
                You want it?

     The monster's eyes glitter.

                Fucking have it!

     She throws the box.  It sails past FRANK and smashes
     through the window.

                             FRANK
                NO!

     He goes to the window.  She takes her chance.  She's
     out of the door in a moment.

                NO!


136  INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY

     KIRSTY propels herself out of the Room, and down the
     stairs, while FRANK vents his anger above her.


137  INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

     She flings open the front door, and pitches herself -
     bleeding and bruised - into the daylight beyond.


138  EXT.   NUMBER 55   DAY

     As she stumbles away down the path, she sees the box
     at her feet, in a litter of broken glass.  She picks
     it up, and continues to run.


139  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   DAY

     A series of shots from KIRSTY'S P.O.V., as she staggers
     along the street.  The sound-track whines; the image
     threatens to be eclipsed by darkness.  People stare
     at her as she runs.  A child points.

     Finally, the CAMERA slows.  She stands still.

     A voice, off camera:

                             VOICE (O.S.)
                Are you all right?

     The CAMERA swings giddily around in the direction of
     the speaker.  A WOMAN comes into view.

                             WOMAN
                Do you need any help?

     As she speaks, the picture fades to white.


140  KIRSTY'S DREAM  (PART TWO)

     The whiteness continues to fill the screen.  Distant,
     incoherent voices are heard, and the thump of blood
     in the inner ear.

     Then darkness seeps into the whiteness, patterns like
     Rorschach inkblots: ambiguous, yet interpretable as
     sexual or horrific imagery.  With the darkness,
     soaking over the scene like blood through the sheet
     in her first dream, fragments of FRANK's previous
     dialogue.

                             FRANK
                Come to Daddy.

                             KIRSTY
                This isn't happening.

                             FRANK
                Some things have to be endured ...

     The darkness is filling the screen

                ... take it from me ...

     Now, total darkness.

                ... Come to Daddy ...

     And suddenly, she wakes.


141  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

     KIRSTY is lying in a bed in a private room.  A NURSE
     is at her bedside, monitoring her condition.

                             NURSE
                You're awake.

     She goes to the door.

                I'll get the doctor.

     She exits.

     KIRSTY tries to sit up.  Her head hurts, badly.  As she
     achieves a sitting position, the door opens.  The
     NURSE returns, with a DOCTOR.

                             DOCTOR
                       (approaching the bed)
                So ... you're back with us.

                             KIRSTY
                I think so.

                             DOCTOR
                How are you feeling?

                             KIRSTY
                Tender.

                             DOCTOR
                You took quite a beating.  Do
                you remember what happened?

     She looks at him, uncertain of where to start.

                             KIRSTY
                I want to speak to my father ...

                             DOCTOR
                       (nods)
                Of course.  We'll bring you a
                telephone.

     The NURSE exits.  The DOCTOR brings the box from his
     pocket.

                Maybe this'll jog your memory.

     He lays it on the bed.  She stares at it, her expression
     betraying nothing.

                I had the Devil's own job
                getting it out of your hand.
                Does it ring any bells?

     She shakes her head.

                Do you want it left?

                             KIRSTY
                Why not?

     He offers her a reassuring smile.

                             DOCTOR
                Chin up.  There's no serious
                damage.  And you're safe here.

                             KIRSTY
                Um.

     He leaves the room.

     KIRSTY picks up the box, tentatively.  She turns it
     over in her hand, examining it.


142  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

     FRANK is standing in the shadows.  He is wearing a
     fresh shirt.  He smirks.   JULIA watches him.

     Downstairs, the telephone rings.  JULIA is very
     nervous now; desperate even.

                             JULIA
                She'll tell them everything ...

                             FRANK
                I don't think so.  She'll want
                Larry first.

                             JULIA
                That's probably her now.  Or
                the police.

                             FRANK
                Maybe.

                             JULIA
                Don't you care?

                             FRANK
                There's very little I can do
                about it.

                             JULIA
                Maybe we should just leave -

                             FRANK
                Like this?  Look at me! LIKE
                THIS?

                             JULIA
                Well we can't just stay here -

                             FRANK
                I need a skin.  Then we leave -


143  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

     KIRSTY is sitting up in bed.  On the bedside table,
     a telephone.  She is now thoroughly engrossed in the
     problems of the box.  Her fingers speed over the
     surfaces, looking for some way in, testing its
     strength.

     Suddenly, a click.  Her face lights up with pleasure,
     as she slides a part of the box open, revealing new
     intricacies.  And to accompany the revelation, a
     tinkling tune.

     She smiles.  It's a musical box.

     The light beside the bed flickers, but she doesn't
     notice.

     The door opens.  It's the NURSE.

                             NURSE
                Comfortable?

                             KIRSTY
                       (smiles)
                Sure.

                             NURSE
                Any luck with your father?

                             KIRSTY
                       (shakes her head)
                He's probably got a meeting.
                I called a friend of mine.  He's
                coming; is that O.K.?

                             NURSE
                Of course.

     The NURSE exits.  As she does go the light flickers again.
     The box clicks.  A new facet is revealed ...

     KIRSTY smiles.


144  EXT.   NUMBER 55   NIGHT

     The front door closes.

                             LARRY
                       (inside)
                Julia?


145  INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT

     LARRY stands in the hall.  JULIA comes down the stairs.
     She looks pale; even ill.

                             LARRY
                What's wrong?

                             JULIA
                I don't know where to begin ...

                             LARRY
                What are you talking about?

                             JULIA
                It's better you see for your-
                self -

     She turns and starts up the stairs.  He follows.


146  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

     KIRSTY has opened more of the box.  The tune is more
     complex now.

     Somewhere a bell has started to ring.  Now, she works
     the final mechanism of the box.  The bedside light
     flickers and goes out.

     The bell rings.  Light pours out of the box.  She
     drops it, shocked.

     The bedside light comes on again.

     She looks up.

     In the wall opposite the end of her bed, a very narrow
     doorway has simply opened in the wall.

     Leaving the box on the bed, she gets up and goes to
     the gap.  As she approaches she hears the distant,
     rhythmical sob of a baby.  She stands at the doorway.


147  INT.   CORRIDOR TO HELL   NIGHT

     We look back at her, a diminutive figure framed against
     a shot of light, from way, way down the corridor.


148  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

     The sobbing goes on.  KIRSTY stares down the corridor -
     which is lit brightly in some places, and is absolutely
     dark in others - not certain of whether to venture down
     it or not.

     She glances towards the door of her room, from the other
     side of which comes the reassuring sound of the hospital
     going about its business.  What's to fear?


149  INT.   CORRIDOR TO HELL   NIGHT

     She steps into the corridor.    The walls rise into
     darkness on either side of her, their surfaces like
     the interior of a pyramid, pitted with age, and
     rotting away.

     She starts towards the sobbing child, bare feet on
     the impacted earth of the passageway.

     The sobbing gets louder as she advances, her form
     disappearing entirely as she passes through the
     intermittent darkness.

     Once, she glances back towards the Hospital Room, to
     reassure herself that it's still there.  It is,
     though it's no more than a sliver of light at the
     far end of the passageway.

     She advances a few more paces.  The atmosphere is
     growing denser; smoke thickens the air.

     Then, a light glows at the other end of the corridor.

     The sound of the sobbing child ceases.

     She stops walking.

     Ahead, the smoke clears and the light brightens, and we
     see a creature - THE ENGINEER - hanging in the space
     between the walls.  It is in silhouette against the
     light, but we can see enough to know that it resembles
     no earthly animal.  Its vast black limbs hold it
     suspended above the corridor, clinging to the stone.
     Its front limbs, vestigial by comparison, hang down
     from beneath its vast head.  Its tail is curled over
     its back.

     KIRSTY's expression registers this horror.  THE ENGINEER
     moves into the light.  Its irises narrow to slits.
     From the tail a vast sting, oozing pus - like venom,
     glides into view.

     And then -

     - it comes at her, advancing along the corridor by
     bracing its legs against the walls.  Its breath is a
     growl in its belly, until it moves into darkness, when
     all sound from it ceases, only to erupt  again as it
     finds the light.

     KIRSTY turns, and starts to run.

     It comes after her at speed.   Darkness, light, darkness,
     light; roars and silence -

     Its jaws spill its thick saliva; its eyes gleam.

     KIRSTY runs blindly down the corridor, back towards the
     safety of the Hospital Room.   But it's very close on her
     heels, lingering -

     As she comes within a few yards of the Room it closes
     on her.


150  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

     She flings herself through the door with THE ENGINEER's
     breath on her back, and turns -

     The doorway has gone.  The wall is sealed.  She approaches
     the wall.   THE ENGINEER scratches on the other side ...

     Then, she realises that the bell is still ringing.  And
     there's a foul smell in the air.

     She looks around.

     She's not alone.

     Standing across the room from her, lit by a strange
     phosphorescence that has no visible source, are four
     extraordinary figures.

     They are CENOBITES.   Each of them is horribly mutilated
     by systems of hooks and pins.  The garments they wear
     are elaborately constructed to marry with their flesh,
     laced through skin in places, hooked into bone.

     The leader of this quartet has pins driven into his head
     at inch intervals.  At his side, a woman whose neck is
     pinned open like a vivisection specimen.  Accompanying
     them is a creature whose mouth is wired into a gaping
     rectangle - the exposed teeth sharpened to points, and
     a fat sweating monster whose eyes are covered by dark
     glasses.

     When the lead CENOBITE speaks, we recognise the voice as
     that of the creature from the beginning of the film.

     KIRSTY stares in amazement.

                             KIRSTY
                Where the hell did you come from?

     The CENOBITE gestures.  The box is lying on the bed.

                             CENOBITE
                The box ... you opened it.
                We came.

                             KIRSTY
                It's just a puzzle box.

                             CENOBITE
                It's a means to summon us -
                it's called the Lament Con-
                figuration.

                             KIRSTY
                Who are you?

                             CENOBITE
                Cenobites.  Explorers in the
                further regions of experience.
                Demons to some.  Angels to
                others.

                             KIRSTY
                Well, I didn't mean to open
                that thing.  You can go back
                wherever you came from.

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                We can't.   Not alone.

     At this, the creature with the wired open jaw chatters
     like a mad monkey.

                             KIRSTY
                This isn't for real.

                             CENOBITE
                You solved the box.  We came.
                Now you must come with us.
                Taste our pleasures.

     The chattering CENOBITE steps towards her.

                             KIRSTY
                Don't touch me!

     The door opens.  It's STEVE.

     KIRSTY's face floods with relief.  STEVE does not
     register the CENOBITES' presence however.

                             KIRSTY
                Steve.  Thank God you came.

                             STEVE
                What happened to you?

     He steps between the CENOBITES.

                             KIRSTY
                These THINGS ... they want to
                take me -

                             STEVE
                What things?

                             CENOBITE
                       (to Kirsty)
                He doesn't see us, or hear us.
                We belong to you, Kirsty.  And
                you to us.

                             KIRSTY
                No!

                             STEVE
                What's wrong?

                             KIRSTY
                Don't let them take me, Steve -

                             STEVE
                I won't let anybody take you.

     He starts to walk towards her, but the creature in the
     dark glasses takes a hooked rod from its back and puts
     the hook to STEVE's neck.   STEVE's hand moves to the
     place; he makes a small sound of pain. The CENOBITE
     takes off its glasses, to see its trick better.  The eyes
     beneath are sewn shut.  It pulls a little more on the hook.
     STEVE winces.

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                If he takes another step, we
                open his throat.

                             KIRSTY
                       (to Steve)
                Please go, Steve.

                             STEVE
                What?

                             KIRSTY
                Just go.  PLEASE.  I'll be O.K.
                I'm going to go see Dad.  He'll
                look after me -

                             STEVE
                       (protesting)
                What did I say?

                             KIRSTY
                Will you GO, damn you?

     Mystified, STEVE retreats a step.

                             STEVE
                I'll come back later, huh?

                             KIRSTY
                Sure.  Why not?

     Still puzzled, STEVE crosses to the door.

                             STEVE
                'Bye.

                             KIRSTY
                'Bye.

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                Good.

                             CENOBITE
                It's time we were away.

                             KIRSTY
                       (almost crying)
                Let me alone, will you?

                             CENOBITE
                No tears please.  It's a waste
                of good suffering.

     The chatterer comes for her.  As it does so desperation
     brings a plan to KIRSTY's head.

                             KIRSTY
                Wait!

     He stops.

                             CENOBITE
                No time for argument.

                             KIRSTY
                You did this before, right?

                             CENOBITE
                Many times.

                             KIRSTY
                To a man called Frank Cotton?

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                Oh yes.

                             KIRSTY
                But he escaped you.

                             CENOBITE
                Nobody escapes us.

                             KIRSTY
                HE did.  I've seen him.  He's
                alive.

                             CENOBITE
                Is that so?   And what are you
                proposing?

                             KIRSTY
                I'll take you to him.  Then you
                take him instead of me.  Back
                wherever you come from.

     The CENOBITE stares at her unblinking.

                             CENOBITE
                Perhaps ...

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                But if you cheat us ...

     The sound of THE ENGINEER, scratching on the other side
     of the wall.  The plaster cracks, violently.

                             CENOBITE
                We'll tear your soul apart!

     We cut back to the cracking plaster, which cracks further.
     We hear STEVE's voice, and pan back into the room.

     The door opens.   KIRSTY and the CENOBITES have gone.

     STEVE is there, with the NURSE.

                             STEVE
                She was trembling all over.

                             NURSE
                I'd better go look for her.

     The NURSE heads for the door.

                             STEVE
                Maybe she's gone back to her -

     He looks round. The NURSE has gone.

                             STEVE
                - father.

     His eyes have alighted on the box, which is lying on
     the bed.

     He picks it up.


151  EXT.   NUMBER 55   NIGHT

     Lights burn in the house, upstairs and down.


152  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

     JULIA sits in front of the dressing table mirror.
     She has a glass of whisky in front of her.  She sips
     from it, studying her face in the mirror.  We've seen
     her in many moods through the story:  now we see a
     mingling of fear and exhilaration on her face.  She gets
     up.  Laid out on the bed is,of all things, her wedding
     gown.


153  INT.   STEVE'S CAR   NIGHT

     STEVE drives towards Lodovico Street, scanning the streets
     for sign of KIRSTY.


154  EXT.   STREET   NIGHT

     As his car drives past, KIRSTY turns a corner.  He does
     not see her.   KIRSTY hurries along the street.  The
     wind is chilly.   Sometimes she hears a bell in it.


155  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT

     STEVE drives up to the house.  The lights are still
     burning.  He gets out of the car, and hurries down the
     path.


156  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT

     He knocks on the door.  There's no reply.


157  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

     Two shadowy, naked figures stand face to face in the
     bedroom.  We can see no detail of their features.  We
     move down their bodies.  They are standing in a shining
     pool of blood.


158  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT

     STEVE starts round the back of the house.


159  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

     The male of the couple pads towards  the bedroom door,
     leaving a trail of blood behind him.  We can still see
     very little of the man.


160  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT

     KIRSTY turns the corner of the street, and starts down
     it.  The wind is strong now.  It is full of sibilant
     whispers, hurrying her along.


161  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

     JULIA dresses.


162  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT

     KIRSTY reaches the doorstep.  As she does so the whispers
     die away completely.   She beats on the door.   No reply.
     She beats again, more urgently.

                             KIRSTY
                Please!   Dad!   It's me!
                It's Kirsty!


163  INT.   LANDING   NIGHT

     JULIA steps onto the landing.  We can hear KIRSTY shouting
     on the step.

                             JULIA
                Damn her.

     We hear a voice, off-screen.  Is it FRANK or LARRY?
     Impossible to be sure.

                             VOICE
                Answer it.


164  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT

     KIRSTY still beats on the door.

                             KIRSTY
                Please, answer me!  Please -

     The door is suddenly opened.  JULIA is standing there.

                             JULIA
                Kirsty?   It's very late.

                             KIRSTY
                Where's Daddy?

                             JULIA
                What's the problem?

                             KIRSTY
                       (stepping inside)
                I have to see my father.

                             JULIA
                Of course.  There's no need to
                shout.


165  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT

     We pan across the table.  At the end of the table sits
     LARRY.  The light is behind him.  His features are
     shadowy.  But we can see that he is badly bruised.

     We hear the womens' voices, off-screen.

                             JULIA
                You look terrible.  Have you had
                an accident?

                             KIRSTY
                I was here this afternoon.

                             JULIA
                This afternoon.

                             KIRSTY
                I saw everything.

                             JULIA
                I'm sorry, I don't follow.
                What was there to see?

     KIRSTY doesn't answer, but walks through into the Dining
     Room.  KIRSTY sees LARRY at the table.

                             KIRSTY
                Oh God.  Thank God.
                       (she starts to sob)
                I thought something might have ...

     She glances round at JULIA, who has also entered.
                       (to Larry)
                I have to talk to you.

                             LARRY
                Of course.

     LARRY leans forward, and into the pool of light over
     the table.  He looks much the worse for wear.  His
     flesh is raw and bruised.  There is blood at his neck
     and hairline.

                             LARRY
                It's all right, sweetheart.
                Julia's told me everything;
                and it's all right ...

                             KIRSTY
                No.  You don't understand. Your
                brother - Frank - he's here in
                the house.  And he's -

                             LARRY
                Whatever Frank did was his error.
                And it's finished with now.

                             KIRSTY
                Finished?

                             LARRY
                       (smiles)
                He's gone.

                             KIRSTY
                Gone?

                             JULIA
                Dead.

                             LARRY
                He was insane, baby:  a mad dog.
                I put him out of his misery -

     KIRSTY stares at LARRY, while in her head she hears the
     CENOBITE's voice.

                             CENOBITE
                ... we'll tear your soul apart ...

                             LARRY
                I'll go to the police, when I'm
                feeling stronger.  Try and find
                some way to make them understand,
                though God knows I don't really
                understand myself.  Did he hurt
                you?

     KIRSTY is dumb with horror at her situation.

                             LARRY
                       (leans back)
                Poor Frank.  He's better off
                dead.

                             KIRSTY
                I don't believe it.

                             LARRY
                I'm afraid it's true.

                             KIRSTY
                       (tears in her eyes)
                I want to see.

                             LARRY
                No you don't.

                             KIRSTY
                Yes!

                             LARRY
                       (to Julia)
                Show her.

     KIRSTY turns away from LARRY.  JULIA leads her out into
     the Hallway.

                                            CUT TO

     LARRY, still sitting at the table.  His fingers drum a
     familiar tattoo.   Beneath his breath, he hums 'Colonel
     Bogey'.


166  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

     JULIA pushes open the door of the Torture Room.  It
     creaks wide.  Lying on the floor inthe middle of the
     room is a skinned corpse, in a tangle of torn clothing.
     It steams.  There is blood everywhere.  That too, steams.

     KIRSTY is revolted.  She steps away from the door, back
     down the landing.

     The bell has begun to ring again, distantly, and there
     is the sound of wings in the air - thousands of birds -
     beating on the other side of the wall.

     KIRSTY starts down the stairs again.

                             JULIA
                Where are you going?

     KIRSTY doesn't reply.  She merely hurries away.

                             JULIA
                       (calling after
                        her)
                You leave this to us, you
                hear me?   We'll deal with
                the police -


167  INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT

     KIRSTY descends the stairs.  LARRY has stepped out of
     the Dining Room and is moving to intercept her as she
     makes her way to the front door.

     The sound of wings, and bells - and a terrible slow
     thunder which underpins it all - mounts in volume.

     LARRY snatches at her arm.

                             LARRY
                Where are you going?

                             KIRSTY
                I have to get out.

     She shrugs off his arm.   The thunder is increasing.

                             LARRY
                Stay with me -

     JULIA is on the stairs, watching this exchange.

                             LARRY
                - it's all right.   Really it
                is ...

     He touches her face, fondly.
                             KIRSTY
                I can't stay.

     She goes to the door.

                             LARRY
                Come to Daddy.

     She hesitates at the door, and turns.


168  INT.  HALLWAY   NIGHT   (KIRSTY'S P.O.V.)

     The thunder fills KIRSTY's head, as she stares at LARRY,
     who has opened his arms to her.

                             LARRY
                Come to Daddy.

     Her gaze moves up to JULIA, who is on the stairs.

                             JULIA
                No, damn you -


169  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT

                             KIRSTY
                       (mouths)
                Oh my God.

     Everything is slowing down.  The bells and the thunder
     fill the soundtrack.

     LARRY smiles, as KIRSTY moves towards him.  Tears have
     begun to fill her eyes.   She searches for him.  His
     smile decays as he realizes her objective.   Her nails
     rake his cheek.   The flesh puckers, and tears along the
     brow.   Blood flows.   The mask of stolen flesh he wears
     slips a little, and FRANK's twisted features come into
     view.

                             JULIA
                Frank!

     KIRSTY screams, as FRANK lunges for her.  The lights in
     the hallway flicker, and threaten to go out.

     KIRSTY avoids FRANK's blow, but in doing so allows him
     to get between her and the front door.  She's trapped.
     His torn face flapping, he opens his jacket (the interior
     of which is blood-stained) and pulls a knife from the
     lining.

     Suddenly, JULIA is behind her, gripping hold of her hair.

     FRANK advances on KIRSTY, but in the last moment before
     the fatal stab KIRSTY twists, avoiding the blow.  JULIA
     shrieks and stumbles forward, the knife gleaming as
     it's buried to the hilt in her side.

     KIRSTY slips from between them.  JULIA collapses into
     FRANK's arms.   He holds her up.

     KIRSTY makes a dive for the front door, but FRANK lets
     JULIA slip and intercepts KIRSTY.  JULIA falls back
     against the wall, dying.  KIRSTY retreats to the bottom
     of the stairs.  FRANK follows.

                             FRANK
                You're not leaving now -

     As he follows, JULIA reaches out and takes hold of his
     sleeve.

     KIRSTY flees the only route she can, upstairs.  The
     house is creaking in every board and rafter now.

     FRANK turns on JULIA, trapping her against the wall.,

                             JULIA
                Help me, Frank. For God's
                sake.

     He puts his hands around her neck, and leans towards
     her.  At the last moment she seems to understand that
     he intends not to kiss her but to steal what little
     life she has left.

                             JULIA
                No, Frank -

     From the stairs KIRSTY glimpses him battering upon
     her.

     Then she looks away, and runs up the stairs.

     When we look back JULIA is withering in FRANK's arms.


170  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT

     The landing is smoky.  The lights have taken on a
     yellowish tinge.  The air is full of moans.

     KIRSTY is desperate for a hiding place.   She tries one
     of the doors, but it's locked.   She opens another, and
     the din of birds' wings gets louder.


171  INT.  BIRD ROOM    NIGHT

     A P.O.V. shot, lunging towards KIRSTY in the doorway.
     She slams the door in the face of whatever's coming
     for her.


172  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT

     FRANK hears the door slam.   He drops JULIA to the
     ground.  She's dead, her flesh rotting on her face.

     FRANK starts to climb the stairs, his eyes burning
     with hunger.


173  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT

     KIRSTY is cornered.   From below, FRANK's voice.

                             FRANK
                Where are you, beautiful?

     KIRSTY starts up the second flight of stairs, as FRANK's
     shadow is thrown up on the wall below.


174  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT

     KIRSTY is faced with a choice.  The Torture Room door
     is open, but the skinned body is in there, so instead
     she heads for the Junk Room, and opens the door.


175  INT.  JUNK ROOM    NIGHT

     Moonlight falls through the window, illuminating a
     chaos of furniture and boxes.  She crosses to the window,
     and tries to get it open.   It won't budge.

                             FRANK
                       (somewhere below)
                Where are you, honey?

     She looks around for a lever to open the window with -


176  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT

     FRANK reaches the landing and opens the bedroom door,
     calling for her. Then he starts up the last flight of
     stairs.

                             FRANK
                Come to Daddy.


177  INT.  JUNK ROOM   NIGHT

     KIRSTY lifts a cloth off one of the boxes.

     Staring up from the box is the corpse of PRUDHOE, his
     eyes and mouth open in a silent shriek.

     She reels back from the box, terrified, backing into the
     shadows.

     An arm reaches for her, taking hold of her and dragging
     her back into darkness as the door opens.  FRANK stands
     on the theshold.   His breath is thick.  He shambles
     forward, but he doesn't see her.

     We CUT back to the shadows.  KIRSTY's eyes are wild
     with terror.

     Back to the door, which clicks closed.

     KIRSTY breaks cover, and so does her saviour.  It's
     STEVE.  He is sweating with terror.

                             KIRSTY
                       (a whisper)
                What are you doing here?

                             STEVE
                Got in downstairs.  Looking
                for you.  What's going on?

     She shakes her head.   STEVE brings the box from his
     jacket.

                             STEVE
                You forgot something -

     She doesn't see what he's produced.  She's already
     moving to the door.  She listens.


178  INT.  UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

     The landing is empty.   The door of the Junk Room opens.

     KIRSTY steps out.

     The house is strangely still.  The lights swing a little;
     but otherwise ... nothing.  She advances along the
     passageway.  STEVE follows.  They reach the top of the
     stairs in safety.

                             STEVE
                       (signalled more than
                       spoken)
                I'll go first -

     As he speaks, FRANK steps out of the Torture Room,
     knife in hand.

     Roaring, he comes at them both.  KIRSTY flings herself
     out of the path of the knife.  FRANK swipes at STEVE,
     who falls backwards down the stairs.   He cries out,
     head hitting the stairs as he descends.

     The box falls from his unconscious hand.

     FRANK turns on KIRSTY, who avoids one slice of the knife,
     and another, but is driven back into the Torture Room.


179  INT.  TORTURE ROOM    NIGHT

     He's after her in a flash.

     She falls beside her father's body, her eyes meeting
     its skinned face.

                             KIRSTY
                God -

                             FRANK
                Don't cry for him.  He's dead.
                He always was.

     KIRSTY has been pushed to the limits of her endurance.
     She can be terrorized and pursued no longer.  Death
     looks an easy option by comparison with more of FRANK's
     horrors.

                             KIRSTY
                Go on.   Kill me.  I don't care.

                             FRANK
                Poor baby.

                             KIRSTY
                You bastard

                             FRANK
                Hush now.   It's all right.
                Frank's here.

                             KIRSTY
                Frank.

                             FRANK
                That's right.  Are you losing
                your mind, baby?  This is Frank
                you're talking to.  FRANK.

     As he speaks the bell begins tolling again.  FRANK looks
     puzzled.

                             FRANK
                What's going on?

     Light begins to pour through the walls of the room.

                No.

     He starts towards the door.  But he's too late.  The
     CENOBITES are standing in his way.  He backs off from
     them.

                             CENOBITE
                Frank -

                             KIRSTY
                       (to Cenobite)
                What took you so long?

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                We had to hear it from his own
                lips -

     FRANK turns on KIRSTY.

                             FRANK
                You set me up!   You bitch.
                You set me up!

     The pattern of light in the room has become more elaborate,
     and the CENOBITES move through it towards FRANK.

                             CENOBITE
                       (to Kirsty)
                This isn't for your eyes.

     KIRSTY crosses towards the door.  As she reaches for the
     handle she hears FRANK roar behind her.  She turns.   He
     breaks between the CENOBITES, knife in hand, but as he
     comes within striking distance the air is full of whining
     sounds and he stops dead.

     They have their hooks in him, we see.  In his arms and
     legs;  in his back and sides;  in his scalp and neck and
     temples.   Hooks attached to countless chains, which
     arrest his progress.  They plough through his flesh as
     he strives to reach her.  But at a gesture from the leader
     of the CENOBITES, the chains are hauled in.  He flings
     back his head, yelling.   The knife drops from his hand.

                             CENOBITE
                       (to Kirsty)
                Out!

     She turns back to the door and opens it.  FRANK is hauled
     back towards the centre of the room.

                             FRANK
                Bitch!

     The house is growling  from basement to eaves now, as
     KIRSTY steps onto the landing.


180  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT

     Behind her, FRANK howls.

     She looks back.

     They have him IN EXTREMIS,    his body spread-eagled;
     hooks in a hundred places, pulling at his flesh.  He
     fights like a wild animal, snarling and cursing.  They
     pull the chains tighter.


181  INT.  TORTURE ROOM    NIGHT

     A close up of FRANK's face.   He suddenly stops fighting.
     He raises his head, his eyes staring up at KIRSTY from
     beneath a bleeding, sweating brow.  He flicks his
     tongue over his bloodied lips.

     Then -

     - he comes apart.


182  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT

     The door slams as FRANK's body is torn apart in a welter
     of blood and flesh fragments.

     Something heavy thuds against the door.

     KIRSTY turns and starts down the stairs.


183  INT.  STAIRS    NIGHT

     As she reaches the place where STEVE is half-sitting, half-
     lying, the house starts to growl as though its foundations
     are about to give way.  STEVE's nose is bleeding, and
     his face is bruised, but he's conscious.

                             KIRSTY
                We have to get out of here.
                They'll kill us for the fun of
                it.

     STEVE staggers to his feet.   KIRSTY picks up the box,
     which is on the lower landing. As she picks it up,
     the FEMALE CENOBITE steps from the shadows.

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                Don't leave us yet -

     KIRSTY starts to try and manipulate the box in her hands.

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                We've got such sights to show
                you -

     KIRSTY manages to slot one of the pieces of the box back
     into place.

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                ... don't ...

     Her voice becomes a howl, and she's sucked away into
     darkness.

                             STEVE
                       (behind Kirsty)
                Jesus Christ.

     They start down to the half-landing.  There stands the
     CENOBITE in the dark-glasses, carrying the hooked rod
     he threatened STEVE with in the hospital.  Again,
     KIRSTY manipulates the box.  Again, the CENOBITE howls
     and is claimed by the darkness.


184  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT

     They hurry down to the hallway, half expecting another
     creature to step into their path.  Dust is falling from
     the ceiling, and there are cracks opening up  in the
     walls.  Any moment, surely, the whole place will be
     destroyed.

     JULIA's body has gone from the hallway;  a trail of blood
     leads into the dining room.

     As KIRSTY and STEVE stumble across the hallway, they hear
     JULIA's voice, off-screen, an eerie, ghostly voice.

                             JULIA
                Kirsty ...

     KIRSTY hesitates, and looks towards the door of the
     dining room.

     There stands the bride, her white dress soaked in blood,
     her veil covering her face.

                             KIRSTY
                Julia?

     KIRSTY takes a step towards her, but as she does so the
     veil rises of its own accord, and the chattering CENOBITE
     is beneath.

     KIRSTY slams the box closed.

     The CENOBITE howls, and disappears.

     STEVE heads for the door.  Turns the handle.

     As he does so, KIRSTY realizes there's one piece of the
     box unfinished.

                             KIRSTY
                Don't!

     Too late.  He turns the handle.   The door is flung
     open, and THE ENGINEER, clinging to the sides of the
     door, swings down into the hallway.

     STEVE is flung backwards against KIRSTY.    The box
     falls from KIRSTY's hand.  The beast moves to bite at
     STEVE, who scrambles out of the way, leaving KIRSTY
     in the front line.

     The box lies between KIRSTY and THE ENGINEER, which now
     uses its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her,
     its legs still bracing it in the door.

     She snatches for the box.  THE ENGINEER, its mouth
     oozing fluids, almost catches her arm.

     Again, she tries.   This time one of its arms seizes hold
     of KIRSTY and drags her towards its jaws.

     Behind KIRSTY, STEVE snatches up a piece of plaster and
     flings it in THE ENGINEER's face.  It momentarily
     relaxes its grip on KIRSTY, who slides her hand from its
     hold and claims the box.  She now has slime on her fingers.
     The box defies her manipulations.

                             STEVE
                Come on!   Come on!

     THE ENGINEER crawls towards them.  Up above, the din
     of the roof collapsing.  Timbers and dust hurtle down
     the stairs.

                             KIRSTY
                Shit.  Shit.  Shit.

     THE ENGINEER is almost upon her.  It rears up, its saliva
     dropping on her.

     And then, miraculously, the last piece of the box slots into
     place.
 
     The same vortex that seized the other CENOBITE seizes
     THE ENGINEER.   Howling its complaint, it is drawn out
     into the darkness beyond the door, and disappears.

     Its voice grows thin, and fades.

     Finally, silence.

     The house is still.

     KIRSTY gets to her feet.  STEVE does the same.

     Together, they move to the door, and out onto the
     step.


185  EXT.  DOORSTEP   NIGHT

     The door slams behind them, of its own accord.

     KIRSTY turns the sealed box over in her hand.

     There is a slit in it which has not quite closed.  Light
     suddenly pours from it, up into KIRSTY's face.  Her
     features are momentarily distorted, as if sucked towards
     the box.  From within:  shrieks, bells, music.

     Between the screams, FRANK's voice.

                             FRANK
                Come to Daddy!

     She slams the panel shut.  The distortions cease. So
     does the din.

                             KIRSTY
                       (quietly)
                Not tonight.

     A smile crosses her face, and she leaves the doorstep,
     making her way towards the street.  STEVE gazes at her,
     then follows.

     Their figures are erased by the darkness.

     Somewhere, a bell rings as ...

     THE CREDITS ROLL

1    TITLE SEQUENCE

     In darkness, a blood-curdling cacophony:  the squeal
     of unoiled winches, the rasp of hooks and razors
     being sharpened; and worse, the howl of tormented
     souls.  Above this din one particular victim yells
     for mercy - a mixture of tears and roars of rage.

     By degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by
     the surrounding tumult, until without warning his
     voice pierces the confusion afresh - this time
     reduced to naked scream.

     And with the sound, an image.

     A house:  NUMBER 55, LODOVICO STREET, an old, three
     storey, late Victorian house, with gaunt trees lining
     its overgrown garden.  Its curtains are drawn, there
     is newspaper over its top window.  The titles begin
     to run, as we approach the house down the driveway.

     We move inside, to the hallway.  The cries are
     louder now.

     Room by room, we explore the empty house, while the
     titles continue to run.  It has been left empty for
     many years, though much of its furniture remains,
     covered in dust-sheets.  On the mantelpiece of one room,
     a plaster saint.  In the kitchen, evidence of life
     here.  Opened tins; bread; bottles of spirits; a
     glass.

     We move upstairs, gliding along the corridor of the
     lower landing.  The din is furious now.  On the
     floor of one room, a makeshift bed: blankets strewn;
     an open suitcase; more liquor.

     We move up a flight and approach a room off the upper
     landing, the door of which is ajar.  The light
     within swings backwards and forwards, spilling into
     the passageway.

     As we reach the door, the screams from within halt
     abruptly.

     We can hear a bell now, which has been pealing
     steadily throughout this opening sequence.

     As we move through the door, the titles end.


2    INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

     The bare bulbs in the room we've entered swing violently,
     disorienting us.  There are chains - dozens of them -
     disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling: all
     are swinging back and forth.  Some end in hooks, with
     pieces of skin and sinew adhering; some are serrated,
     others simply drip blood.

     The bell tolls on.

     On the blood-spattered floor, a box, some six inches
     square, which resembles an elaborate Chinese puzzle
     box.  Later, we'll learn its name and function.
     It's called the Lament Configuration, and it's a
     way to raise Hell.  LITERALLY. For now, it remains
     an enigma.

     A hand, its flesh systematically pierced with needles,
     reaches down and picks the box up.

     In close up we see just what an elaborate construction
     it is, made up of sliding panels and mysterious
     chambers.  It is open at present, its polished
     innards exposed.  Out of it, a banal melody, played
     on a hidden mechanism.  The hands, which belong to
     one of the demons - a CENOBITE - move over the box.

                             CENOBITE
                       (unseen)
                It's over ...

     Delicately, the hands begin to reconstruct the box,
     sliding the well-oiled parts back into place, the
     tune simplifying with each manoeuvre.

     The room is getting darker.  The chains are disappearing
     into the gloom.

     We see tantalizing glimpses of other figures, turning
     from the light and fading into the darkness.  We catch
     sight of monstrous faces, but only for the briefest
     of moments.  Then they're gone.

     The box is almost returned to its unopened condition.

     The last sounds to fade are the tune from the box,
     and the bell.

     It tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid
     into place.

     The light stops swinging. The panel clicks.  The tune
     stops.

     At last, a long shot of the room.  At the far end the
     window is covered with yellowed newspapers.  There is
     dust settling through the air.

     Otherwise it is empty.

     The bell fades.

     It's as if nothing ever happened here.

     Except ...

     Somewhere, very quietly, a creaking that could be
     the sound of floorboards, or the low, agonized gasp
     of a thing barely alive.


3    INT.   HALLWAY    DAY

     The wind is blaring as we watch the door of Number
     55. From the doorstep, voices.  One is that of
     LARRY COTTON, the other his wife JULIA.  Clearly
     LARRY is attempting to get inside.  We hear the
     sound of keys tried in the lock.

                             LARRY
                It's one of these.

                             JULIA
                We're going to freeze to death.

                             LARRY
                0.K.  0.K.

     The sound of another key tried in the lock.

                             JULIA
                Maybe somebody changed the lock.

                             LARRY
                       (slightly irritated)
                Like who?

                             JULIA
                Just a thought -

                             LARRY
                Ah!

     The key is turned.

                             LARRY
                Success.

     The door swings open.

                Voila!

     We see the pair on the doorstep.  LARRY is an American
     in his early forties, an attractive man who has lost
     his edge in recent years.  He looks harassed; he smirks
     too much.  A little, but significant, corner of him
     is utterly defeated.  JULIA, his wife, is English:
     and looks perhaps ten years his junior.  She is
     beautiful, but her face betrays a barely buried
     unhappiness.  Life has disappointed her too, of
     late: and LARRY has been a major part of their
     disappointment.

                             LARRY
                Well.  This is it.

     They step over the threshold.


4    INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY

     The door of the Torture Room creaks, as the wind blows
     it opens an inch.  From downstairs, we hear JULIA's
     voice.

                             JULIA
                It smells damp.

                             LARRY
                It's just been empty a while.


5    INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

    LARRY slams the front door.


6    INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY

     The Torture Room door creaks closed again.

                             LARRY
                       (from below)
                Besides, it's an old house.


7    INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

     He stands in the hallway, not certain which way to
     go from here.

                             JULIA
                How long since you were here?

                             LARRY
                The best part of ten years.

     LARRY picks up some mail - circulars mostly - from
     behind the door, then leads JULIA through from the
     hallway to explore the ground floor.

                             LARRY
                I wanted to sell it off at
                one point, after the old Lady
                died, but I couldn't get Frank
                to agree.

     He opens one of the doors, and looks inside.

                             LARRY
                       (with pleasure)
                Christ.  It's not been touched.

     He continues along the passageway.  He opens another
     door, and steps into a large room.  He opens one of
     the curtains.  Light pours in, dust-laden shafts falling
     on the sheeted furniture.

                             LARRY
                Look at this.

     JULIA lingers in the doorway.

                             JULIA
                Why didn't he want to sell it?

                             LARRY
                       (dismissively)
                I don't know. Probably wanted
                a hideaway.

     He pulls a sheet off a chair.

                Look at this stuff.

     The chair is ugly; old fashioned.  JULIA is unimpressed.

                             JULIA
                Not exactly modern.

                             LARRY
                       (shrugs)
                We'll sell it.  Sell everything.

                             JULIA
                I thought half of it was your
                brother's?

                             LARRY
                He won't complain.  He can pay
                off some of his creditors.

     LARRY is getting more enthusiastic about the place by
     the moment.  He leaves the room, moving past JULIA
     to explore further.

                             LARRY
                You know we have to let Kirsty
                see this place, before we do
                anything to it.  She'll love it.

                             JULIA
                You mean we're moving in?

     LARRY pauses.  Looks at her.

                             LARRY
                You don't like it?

     JULIA shrugs.

                             JULIA
                It's better than Brooklyn.

     She turns back down the hallway. He watches her, then
     follows.

                             LARRY
                You're still blaming me.

                             JULIA
                No.  I'm not.

                             LARRY
                You wanted to come back to
                London.  We came back.

     We are hearing the tip of a debate they've had dozens
     of times, which immediately annoys them both.

                             JULIA
                All right.

                             LARRY
                So what's the argument?

                             JULIA
                       (cold)
                No argument.

                             LARRY
                Oh Christ.  Julia ...

     JULIA wanders back to the bottom of the stairs.  Then
     starts to climb.

                             LARRY
                       (exasperated, to
                        himself)
                Shit.


8    INT.   LANDING   DAY

     JULIA climbs the stairs, her face charged with suppressed
     feeling.  She's sick of LARRY; his enthusiasm depresses
     her, his compromises anger her.  What's between them
     is stale, like this house.


9    INT.    TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     The door opens a fraction.


10   INT.   KITCHEN    DAY

     LARRY has stepped into the kitchen, to find the remains
     of the food we briefly glimpsed in the titles sequence,
     now rotted and fungal.  It smells, to judge the
     expression on his face.  It also puzzles him. Then,
     from above:

                             JULIA
                Larry!

     He leaves the kitchen and retraces his steps to the
     bottom of the stairs.

                Larry!

                             LARRY
                I hear you.

     He starts up the stairs.


11   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     LARRY reaches the top of the stairs.

                             LARRY
                Where are you?

                             JULIA
                       (out of sight)
                In here.

     LARRY follows JULIA's voice to the end of the corridor.
     JULIA is standing in a doorway.  Beyond, the 'bedroom'
     we saw in the titles sequence, untouched since then.

                             JULIA
                Squatters?

     LARRY steps past her, and throws back the blankets.
     Wood-lice scurry away.  He goes to the suitcase, and
     starts looking through it.  Besides clothes there's a
     lot else that speaks of its owner: bric-a-brac picked
     up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets;
     Fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from
     a dozen countries.  Amongst the stuff, some photographs.
     LARRY peers at them.  One pictures a good-looking
     intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed
     with a naked Chinese girl.

                             LARRY
                Frank.

     At the door, we see JULIA almost flinch at the name.

                             JULIA
                He's here?

                             LARRY
                He's been here.  There's stuff
                in the kitchen.  He must have
                made a hasty exit.

     The 'phone rings downstairs.  JULIA jumps.

                That'll be Kirsty.

     LARRY stands up and leaves the room, moving past JULIA
     in the doorway, who is left to stare down at the
     bed FRANK has slept in, and the suitcase of belongings.
     As we hear LARRY clatter downstairs it seems JULIA's
     face is close to tears.


12   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY

     The 'phone continues to ring.  LARRY steps through
     and picks up the receiver.

                             LARRY
                Hello ...?

     There's no answer.

                Hello ...?


13   INT.   FRANK'S 'BEDROOM'   DAY

     JULIA goes to the open suitcase, and looks at the
     photographs.


14   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM    DAY

                             LARRY
                       (on'phone)
                Is there anybody there?

     He puts down the 'phone.  He goes back out into the
     hall.


15   INT.   FRANK'S 'BEDROOM'   DAY

     Nervous that LARRY will return and see what she's
     doing, JULIA is going through the photographs.

                             LARRY
                       (from below)
                There's nobody there -

     The sound of his foot on the stairs.  Hurriedly, she
     selects a photograph of Frank without the girl, and
     pockets it.


16   INT.   STAIRS   DAY

     LARRY is climbing the stairs.

                             LARRY
                I'm surprised it's even connected ...

     The 'phone rings again.

                Shit.


17   INT.   FRANK'S BEDROOM    DAY

     Mission accomplished, JULIA leaves the bedroom, taking
     one last glance at the sweat-stained sheet and the
     indented pillar where Frank lay.  A lone wood-louse
     crawls over the sheet, navigating the folds.  She
     closes the door on the sight.  Downstairs, the
     'phone stops ringing.


18   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY

     LARRY has picked up the 'phone.

                             LARRY
                Who's there?

                             KIRSTY
                       (barely audible)
                Daddy?

                                            CUT TO


19   INT.   KIRSTY'S ROOM    DAY

     KIRSTY, the daughter of Larry's first marriage, and
     his only child, on the 'phone.  She is barely twenty,
     beautiful in an unpretensious way: a dream of a girl-
     next-door.  We can't see much of the room she's in at
     the moment, the shot is too tight.

                             LARRY   (V.0.)
                Kirsty?

                             KIRSTY
                I got through.

                             LARRY   (V.O.)
                Where are you?

                             KIRSTY
                I found a room.


20   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY

                             LARRY
                       (on 'phone)
                What did you say?


21   INT.   KIRSTY'S ROOM   DAY

                             KIRSTY
                I said: I found a room.

     We begin to draw back from KIRSTY now, as she continues to
     speak to her father.  She's sitting on a battered chair
     by the door.  The room she's in is cramped and dirty.
     From outside, the sound of trains going by.

                             LARRY (V.0.)
                I thought you were going to
                stay with us for awhile?

                             KIRSTY
                       (pained)
                No Dad.

                             LARRY (V.0.)
                You'd like the house.

                             KIRSTY
                YOU'D like my room.

                             LARRY (V.0.)
                Do you want me to come over?

                             KIRSTY
                       (hastily)
                No, no.  Not just yet.  It
                needs ... er ... some work.

     That it does.  The place, now we've got a good view
     of it, is a total dump.

                             LARRY (V.0.)
                Well I want you to see the
                house.

                             KIRSTY
                I'm not going to change my
                mind, Dad.

     As she speaks she reaches forward to pull a picture,
     tacked to the wall, of a ourangoutang, with breasts
     collaged onto it, down.  She succeeds.  Beneath there's
     a large hole in the wall, which the picture was there
     to conceal.  Plaster falls from it.

                             KIRSTY
                       (mouths the word)
                Great.

                             LARRY (V.0.)
                Well come over, will you?
                See the place?

                             KIRSTY
                Maybe tomorrow.  I got to go
                look for a job.

                             LARRY (V.0.)
                O.K. Honey. Well you take care.
                I love you.

                             KIRSTY
                I love you too.

     She puts the receiver down.  As she does so the small
     table on which the 'phone is sitting collapses.  She
     covers her face with her hand.


22   INT.   HALLWAY OF LODOVICO STREET    DAY

     JULIA is three steps from the bottom of the stairs.

                             LARRY
                Well?

                             JULIA
                       (resigned)
                Why not?

                             LARRY
                       (smiles; he's pleased)
                We'll move in Sunday.


23   INT.   DOWNSTAIRS ROOM   DAY

     A church bell rings.  Off-screen, we hear voices:
     two men are attempting to move a bed into the house
     with LARRY masterminding the manoeuvres.  We HEAR
     their efforts, but we don't yet see them.  Our
     interest is in JULIA, who is unpacking a tea-chest
     in a room which is still full of draped furniture.

                             1ST MAN (O.S.)
                We're not going to get it in.

                             2ND MAN (O.S.)
                Tip it!  Tip it!

                             LARRY (O.S.)
                Wait!  Wait!  Watch the fucking
                paint work.

                             1ST MAN (O.S.)
                Look, do you want the bed in or
                not?

                             LARRY (0.S.)
                Just take it slowly.

                             1ST MAN (O.S.)
                Oh, sod you.

                             2ND MAN (O.S.)
                Eh, Chas, slow it down like
                the man says.

                             LARRY (O.S.)
                It'll go in.

                             1ST MAN
                Famous last fucking words.

     JULIA's face through this has been almost devoid of
     expression.  She's holding so many feelings inside;
     deep inside.  Now she moves from one box to another,
     and opens it to find it full of bathroom bric-a-brac.
     She picks it up and goes through into the hallway.

     The bell continues to ring.


24   INT.   HALLWAY    DAY

     The three sweating men have the bed wedged in the
     door.

                             LARRY
                       (not seeing Julia)
                Alright, let's give it another
                try.

                             2ND MAN
                       (sees Julia)
                Do you really need this bed, lady?

     LARRY turns.  Sees JULIA.

                             LARRY
                How are you doing through
                there?

                             JULIA
                It looks like a bomb's dropped.

                             2ND MAN 
                Got any beer?

                             JULIA
                There's some in the 'fridge.

     Nobody moves to get it.  Certainly JULIA has no
     intention of being waitress.  She goes to the bottom
     of the stairs.

                             LARRY
                I'll get it.

     LARRY disappears through into the kitchen.  JULIA
     starts up the stairs, watched appreciatively by the
     two men in the doorway.  One leans over and whispers
     to the other, who laughs.  JULIA glances back at
     them. The whisperer licks his lips; the meaning
     of the gesture perfectly apparent.  JULIA heads
     upstairs.


25   EXT.   NUMBER 55     DAY

     KIRSTY arrives at the head of the drive.  The two
     men are drinking beers.  The bed has not been moved.

     She wanders down the drive towards the house.


26   EXT.   DOORSTEP    DAY

                             2ND MAN
                       (seeing Kirsty)
                It's my lucky day.

                             KIRSTY 
                Hi.

                             2ND MAN
                Want to buy a bed?

                             KIRSTY
                Not much.

     She moves past them, attempting to insinuate herself
     between the bed and the door-jamb.  They watch,
     enjoying her efforts.


27   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

                             KIRSTY 
                Dad?

     LARRY emerges from one of the rooms, looking harassed.
     His face lightens as he sees his daughter.

                             LARRY
                Honey!

     They hug each other.

                             KIRSTY
                Big house.

                             LARRY
                You like?

                             KIRSTY
                Me like.

     Another hug.

                             LARRY
                I'll show you around when we've
                got this damn bed moved.

                             KIRSTY
                Is Julia here?

                             LARRY
                Upstairs.
                       (his voice lowers)
                Treat her gently, huh?  She
                hates moving.

                             KIRSTY
                       (dryly)
                Suprise.

                             LARRY
                       (a gently chiding
                        voice)
                Kirsty.

                             KIRSTY
                O.K.  I'll be nice.  You get
                on with the muscle work.  I'll
                make myself some coffee.

                             LARRY
                Kitchen's through on your left

     KIRSTY kisses LARRY, and goes through to the kitchen.
     LARRY turns back to the door.  The men have been
     watching KIRSTY.  LARRY clearly dislikes the scrutiny.
     1ST MAN, out-stared by LARRY, looks away.  The 2ND
     MAN is unperturbed.

                             2ND MAN
                That your daughter?

                             LARRY
                Uh-huh.

                             2ND MAN
                       (grins oafishly)
                Got her mother's looks.

                             LARRY
                Her mother's dead.

     2ND MAN's grin fades.

                             2ND MAN
                Oh.

                             LARRY
                Julia's my second wife.

                             2ND MAN
                       (weakly)
                Lucky man.

                             LARRY
                Damn right.  Now are we going
                to move the bed or not?


28   INT.   KITCHEN   DAY

     The kitchen is chaotic.  Cutlery, crockery, utensils,
     pans and foodstuffs have been heaped on every
     available surface.  KIRSTY has found the kettle,
     but is having difficulty turning on the tap.  She
     struggles with it.  No joy.  Just a rattling sound
     in the pipes as the system lurches into action.


29   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     The pipes rattle and chug behind the plaster.  The
     CAMERA moves along the corridor, hugging the wall.
     At the end of the corridor stands JULIA, in a
     patch of sunlight.  She has the photograph of FRANK
     in her hands.

     She looks intently at it.

     A CLOSE-UP of the photograph.  Then FRANK's voice.

                             FRANK
                Can I come in?

     JULIA looks up from the photograph.


30   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY

     A front door opens.  On the step of another house
     stands FRANK, with two suitcases.  It's raining
     outside; HARD.  The rain has plastered his hair to
     his scalp, which only emphasizes his raw good looks.
     He's unshaven; his eyes are dark, and intense.
     Again, the line she remembers:

                             FRANK
                Can I come in?

     The splash of rain on the step becomes a spurt of
     water, as we

                                            CUT BACK TO

     the present day.


31   INT.   KITCHEN   DAY

     The tap has come on suddenly, spraying KIRSTY with
     water.  She jumps back, soaked.

                             KIRSTY 
                Shit!  Shit!

     She reaches to turn the pressure down.


32   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

     The men are struggling with the bed again.

                             LARRY
                       (calls through)
                Are you O.K.?

                             KIRSTY
                       (from kitchen)
                Sure.


33   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     Again, JULIA returns her gaze to the photograph.


34   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY

     The same scene:  FRANK in the doorstep.  Now we

                                            CUT TO

     the person who opened the door.  It's JULIA; a younger
     JULIA, her hair arranged differently, her clothes
     brighter.  It is two weeks before her marriage to
     LARRY.  She looks at the man on the doorstep without
     a trace of recognition on her face.

                             FRANK
                You're Julia, right?

                             JULIA
                That's right.  Who are you?

                             FRANK
                       (a dazzling smile)
                I'm brother Frank.

                             JULIA
                       (smiles)
                Oh.

                             FRANK
                I came for the wedding.

     He looks at her, eyes glittering.  His hold on her
     is almost mesmeric.

     There is going to BE a wedding?

                             JULIA
                Oh.  Oh yes.

                             FRANK
                Well can I come in or not?

                             JULIA
                I'm sorry.  Of course.  You're
                very welcome.

     He steps inside.  Now he is close to her, rain running
     down his face.  We can hear his breath; sense the
     almost intimidating intimacy of his presence.

                             FRANK
                That's nice to know.
                       (pause)
                Have you got a towel?


35   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     JULIA stares down at the photograph.  Off scrren,
     KIRSTY's voice:

                             KIRSTY (O.S.)
                Have you got a towel?

     JULIA looks up.  At the top of the stairs, KIRSTY
     soaked from the tap.  JULIA looks up, and hurriedly
     pockets the photograph.

                             JULIA
                Kirsty.

                             KIRSTY
                Hi.  I got soaked.

                             JULIA
                There's a towel in the bath-
                room.

                             KIRSTY
                Which is where?

                             JULIA
                Just to your left.

     KIRSTY ducks into the bathroom.  We

                                            CUT BACK TO

     JULIA.  It's clear the memory of her first meeting
     with FRANK has affected her deeply.  The tears that
     threatened earlier are close.


36   INT.   BATHROOM   DAY

     KIRSTY has unbuttoned her blouse and is drying herself.

                             KIRSTY
                Did Dad tell you I got a room,
                by the way?  Waterloo.  Centre
                of the known universe.

     Silence from outside.

                Julia?

                       (she puts her head
                        out of the bathroom)


37   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     JULIA has gone.


38   INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY

     The door of the Torture Room is pushed open.  JULIA
     steps inside.


39   INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     KIRSTY hears the creak of footsteps on the boards
     above.  JULIA's behaviour puzzles her, but she's
     not about to waste time thinking too hard about it.
     She starts downstairs again.


40   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     We have an odd, hovering point of view of JULIA,
     as she steps inside the room.  Something about the
     atmosphere distresses her.

     There is a scratching sound.  She looks down.  A
     wood-louse, recalling Frank's foresaken bed, crawls
     along the edge of the skirting board.  She crosses
     to the window, and tears away a little spy-hole
     in the aged newspaper.

     From downstairs, the voices of the bed-movers.

                             1ST MAN
                Have you got it?

                             2ND MAN
                I've got it.  I told you -

                             LARRY
                Wait!  Wait!

     The light through the window falls on her eye.
     The screen becomes a white-out, from which emerges:


41   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY

     A bedroom, with afternoon sunlight pouring between
     the slats of bamboo blinds.  Outside we can hear
     children playing summer games.  Inside, a fly buzzes.

     JULIA, the younger self, is holding her wedding
     dress in front of her, displaying it.

                             JULIA
                Well?

                             FRANK (0.S.)
                I don't want to see the dress.

                             JULIA
                But you said -

                             FRANK
                I don't want to see the dress.

     JULIA lets the dress drop a few inches in front
     of her.  She stares at FRANK.

                             FRANK
                You know what I want.

     Still she doesn't let the 'defence' that the dress
     offers - a reminder of her imminent marriage - fall.
     She stares though, and there's an invitation in her
     eyes.

                             FRANK
                I want you.

     Now we

                                            CUT TO

     FRANK.  He is not so beraggled as in the first scene,
     but the heat of the day has brought a sheen of sweat
     to his face.  Standing half in shadow he looks almost
     dangerous.

     Now JULIA lets the dress drop, putting it on the
     bed behind her.

                             FRANK
                That's better

     FRANK steps towards her.

                             JULIA
                What about Larry -

                             FRANK
                Forget him.

     FRANK takes hold of her.  She doesn't resist him,
     though there is barely disguised fear on her face.
     He puts his hand inside her blouse.


42   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     In extreme CLOSE UP, JULIA blinks into the light
     through the window, as LARRY's voice from downstairs
     calls her from her reverie.

                             LARRY
                Slowly, will you?  Slowly!

     Again, a white-CUT, from which emerges:


43   INT.   JULIA'S FLASHBACK   DAY

     The two are naked on the bed, both sweating now.
     Beneath them, the wedding dress, crushed under their
     weight.

     Their love-making is not straight-forward: there is
     an element of erotic perversity in the way FRANK
     licks at her face, almost like an animal, his hold
     on her too tight to be loving.  The sequence
     escalates into a series of strange details from
     their locked bodies.  Nails digging into palms;
     sweat rivulets running down their torsoes.  And
     once in a while we see their faces.  JULIA watching
     FRANK, mesmerized and amused by his intensity;
     FRANK almost pained by his desire to push the
     experience TO THE LIMIT.  Their passion is rendered
     stranger still by the way the light through the window
     falls on their bodies, making striped creatures of them.

     At last, as their urgency increases, we move up
     until we're looking directly down on the bed.
     From here it is JULIA's face we can see, and the
     ecstasy of the moment has seized her.  Her arms
     are flung up over her head; her eyes are closed
     as she murmurs:

                             JULIA
                Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh
                my God.

     The scene whites out.


44   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     JULIA is still staring into the light.  She sobs, very
     quietly.

                             JULIA
                       (a whisper)
                Oh Frank ...


45   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

     Downstairs, LARRY and the men have moved the bed
     across the hall to the bottom of the stairs.

     All three are weary now, and getting careless.

     As they start up the stairs we see trouble ahead
     for LARRY, whose hand is moving closer and closer
     to a nail proturbing from the woodwork of the
     bannister.

                             LARRY
                       (to Movers)
                Will you take the weight while
                I take a step up?

     He backs towards the stairs - and the nail.

                Damn it, will you take the -

     The side of his hand is impaled bythe nail.  He cries
     out.  The weight of the bed, which he cannot relinquish,
     drives the nail deeper, and gouges a long cut from
     the ball of his thumb to his wrist.  Blood pours out.

                             LARRY
                Christ!

                             1ST MAN
                What's the problem?

                             LARRY
                My fucking hand!

     He drops his edge of the bed, and disengages his hand
     from the nail upon which he's injured himself.  He
     lifts his hand, from which blood is pouring.

                             LARRY
                You fucking ass-holes.

                             1ST MAN
                Who are you calling a fucking
                ass-hole?  It's this bastard
                bed that's your fucking problem!

     LARRY isn't listening.  He's looking at the wound
     in his hand.  He hates the sight of his own blood.
     Any moment, he may faint.

                             LARRY
                ... Oh Christ ...

     But not in front of these bastards.  He turns and
     starts up the stairs, groggier by the moment.

                             LARRY
                ... oh ... Christ ...


46   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     JULIA is standing in the middle of the room.  A single
     dart of light, through the hole she tore in the
     newspaper, strikes her face.  Softly on the soundtrack,
     the scrabbling noise of the woodlice.


47   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

     The bed has been put down.  1ST MAN and 2ND MAN are
     putting on their coats.  KIRSTY comes through from
     the kitchen.

                             KIRSTY
                What's happening?

                             2ND MAN
                We're leaving.

                             KIRSTY
                Where's my father?

                             1ST MAN
                He's fucked off.

                             2ND MAN
                       (mock chiding)
                Eh ... LANGUAGE.

                             1ST MAN
                Sorry.  He's gone upstairs.  So
                we're fucking off too.

     2ND MAN takes a sheet of paper from his jacket.

                             2ND MAN
                Will you sign for the bed?

                             KIRSTY
                Sure.


48   INT.   STAIRS   DAY

     LARRY, his hand running with blood, climbs the last
     flight of stairs.

                             LARRY
                       (weakly)
                ... Julia ...


49   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     JULIA hears him, and turns from her silent communing with
     the room.  She crosses towards the door.  Too late.
     It opens.  LARRY steps inside, blood pouring from
     his right hand, which he attempts to staunch with his
     left hand.

                             JULIA
                What have you done?

                             LARRY
                I cut myself.

     Blood has started to drip, unnoticed by either of them,
     onto the bare boards.  Heavy splashes.

     LARRY looks sick; his face clammy with sweat.  She stares
     at him without a trace of feeling for him on her face.

                             JULIA
                Is it deep?

                             LARRY
                I don't know, I haven't looked.
                You know me and blood.

                             JULIA
                You're NOT going to faint.

                             LARRY
                       (he leans againts
                        the wall)
                Shit.

                             JULIA
                Let me see.

     She goes to him.  He looks away as she unglues one hand
     from the other, and looks at the wound.  Blood comes faster,
     hitting the floor between them.

                             JULIA
                It's probably going to need
                stitches.

                             LARRY
                I'm going to throw up.

                             JULIA
                No, you're not.

     The blood keeps hitting the floor.  Slap; slap; slap.

                We'll get you out into the
                fresh air.

     He is again clamping his hand over the wound, as JULIA
     helps him to the door.  They leave the Torture Room.
     We hear their voices receding down the passageway,
     as we again assume that hovering view point.  The
     floor, is heavily spattered with blood.

                             JULIA
                Take it slowly.

                             LARRY
                So damn stupid.

                             JULIA
                You're done worse.

                             LARRY
                I'll be scarred for life.

                             JULIA
                No you won't.


50   INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

     KIRSTY is half way up the stairs, as JULIA and LARRY
     head down.

                             KIRSTY
                What happened?

                             JULIA
                Just an accident.  He's all
                right.  Will you drive?  He
                needs stitches.

                             KIRSTY
                Sure.

                             JULIA
                The keys are in the kitchen.

     KIRSTY heads back to the kitchen.  JULIA helps LARRY
     towards the front door.

     The CAMERA swings away from them, upstairs, and
     begins to track ...

     LAP-DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY

     ... we continue to track, towards the Torture Room.

     Downstairs, the front door slams.

     LAP-DISSOLVE TO:

     INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     From outside, the sound of a car door slamming.  An
     engine starts.  The car drives away.

     We move towards the blood on the floor.  As we watch,
     it begins to disappear, as if being absorbed by the
     room.  We pan up to the wall.  The plaster is not
     quite smooth; indeed, it now begins to grow restless,
     and cracks.  Something begins to move in the wall ...


51   INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT

     An explosion of laughter.  We

                       CUT TO

     the remains of a rack of lamb, its gravy now congealed,
     scraps of meat adhering to the bone here and there.
     This is the centre-piece of a table reduced to a
     battlefield by the guests who are laughing off-screen.
     We pass along the table, taking in dirty plates and
     cutlery, napkins, glasses and emptied wine bottles.
     Finally, we reach JULIA, who is still sitting at the
     table, while the others have retired to more comfortable
     seats.  She looks utterly miserable, and a little
     drunk.

     The room has been spruced up for the party.  Candles
     are burning on tables and mantelpiece, there are
     pictures on the walls.  But this is essentially
     cosmetic.  The place has not been refurnished or re-
     decorated.

     We move to the party guests.  Two, we recognize:
     KIRSTY, and LARRY - who is presently entertaining
     the gathering with an account of his accident.  The
     others are new faces.  An American couple:  BILL
     UNDERWOOD and his wife EVELYN, who are of an age with
     LARRY, and a younger, bespectacled man - a work
     colleague of LARRY's - STEVE O'DONNELL.  All are drunk.
     A brandy bottle sits on the table between them, and
     half a dozen other liquer bottles besides.  STEVE,
     it soon becomes apparent, has his eyes on KIRSTY.

     LARRY is half-way through his hospital story,
     gesticulating wildly as he goes through the tale,
     much to the pleasure of the rest.  His hand and
     lower arm are heavily bandaged.

                             LARRY
                - always hated the sight of my
                own blood.  I go out like a light.
                Anybody else's?  no problem.  But
                mine ... you know ... goes straight
                to my head.  Anyhow, this damn
                doctor's poking around and I'm
                saying: I'm going to pass out,
                and he's saying, no you're not, no
                you're not.  Next thing I know -

     We

                                            CUT BACK TO

     JULIA, who watches her husband, unamused.

                             LARRY
                - I wake up On the floor.

     Gales of laughter at this.

                And it was HIM who was looking
                sick.

                             BILL
                Probably thought you'd sue.

                             LARRY
                I should do it!

                             EVELYN
                Doctors -

                             LARRY
                I know.  And he's saying: I'm
                sorry.  I'm sorry.

                             BILL
                HE'S sorry.

                             LARRY
                Right ...
                       (he has picked up
                        the brandy bottle)
                Anyone for more?

                             EVELYN
                       (protests)
                No ... no ... I ...

                             LARRY
                Come on, you're only young once -

     LARRY fills up her glass.

                             LARRY
                       (to Kirsty)
                What are you drinking, love?

                             KIRSTY
                       (giggles)
                I've forgotten.

                             LARRY
                Steve?

                             STEVE
                We're on the Cointreau.

                             KIRSTY
                That's right.  Cointreau.

     STEVE picks up the bottle.

                             STEVE
                I'll do it.

     He fills up KIRSTY's glass.

                             KIRSTY
                I won't be able to stand.

                             STEVE
                So lie down.

     She casts him a sly glance.  He smiles.  She smiles.

     JULIA now stands up.

                             JULIA
                Would you excuse me?  I think
                I'm going to go to bed.

                             LARRY
                Are you O.K.?

     JULIA nods.

                             BILL
                       (looks at his watch)
                Christ.  I think it's time we
                were away -

     He stands.

                             LARRY
                Bill?  Absolutely not.  Sit
                down.  We've got celebrating
                to do.

     JULIA looks frosty, but LARRY does not catch the look.
     KIRSTY does however.  BILL sits down.

                             STEVE
                       (to Julia)
                It was a wonderful meal.

                             EVELYN
                       (gushing)
                Oh it was.  It was wonderful.

     There's a chorus of approval.  JULIA puts a smile on.

                             JULIA
                I'm glad you enjoyed it.

                             EVELYN
                See you again soon.

                             BILL
                You must come round.

                             EVELYN
                Yes.  You must.  We're so happy
                you're back.

                             JULIA
                       (at the door)
                That's nice.  Well ... goodnight.

     She exits, to a chorus of goodnights.  KIRSTY in
     particular watches her as she makes her exit.  JULIA's
     behaviour confounds her.  Meanwhile, the conversation
     has returned to LARRY's 'wound'.

                             EVELYN
                Does it still hurt?

                             LARRY
                Only when I laugh.

     This wins another round of laughter.


52   INT.   LOWER LANDING   NIGHT

     JULIA walks along the landing, while the laughter - muted
     by distance - wafts up from below.

     From the floor above, she hears something more.
     She stops, puzzled, then starts up the second flight
     of stairs towards the Torture Room.


53   INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

     She approaches the Torture Room, and steps inside.


54   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

     The sound of laughter is considerably dimmed in here;
     it's barely audible.  But there is another sound, a
     shifting sound in the corner of the room.

     She reaches for the light switch, and turns it on.
     The bulb's been broken however.  She stares around
     the room, trying to make sense of the shadows.

     Nervously, she approaches the wall, on which four
     streaks of light from the window fall.  Now she
     looks towards the window and realizes that the
     newspaper has been torn, as if by four fingers.  Her
     breath catches.  Suddenly, she's afraid.

     She stands absolutely still, eyes wide in the gloom.

                             JULIA
                Who's there?

     On the far side of the room, a movement in the shadows.

     JULIA almost retreats, but something keeps her staring
     into the murk, as SOMETHING - the remnants of a human
     form made of twisted, blistered strands of flesh,
     raises its head.  It's squatting against the wall,
     unable to lift itself into a standing position.  Its
     eyes, however, have life in them: and hunger. This,
     though he's unrecognizable, is FRANK.

                             FRANK
                       (a pained whisper)
                Julia.

                             JULIA
                Oh my God.

                             FRANK
                Don't look at me.

                             JULIA
                Who are you?

                             FRANK
                I said: don't look.

     She looks away.

                Help me.

                             JULIA
                Tell me who you are.

                             FRANK
                Frank.

     JULIA's face registers horror and disbelief.

                             JULIA
                No.  God no.

                             FRANK
                Believe me.  It's me.  It's
                really me.

                             JULIA
                What happened to you?

                             FRANK
                His blood ... on the floor ...
                It brought me back.

                             JULIA
                Back from where?

                             FRANK
                Just help, will you?  Please God,
                help me -

     From downstairs, dimly, laughter.


55   INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT

     LARRY has just told another story.  General drunken
     laughter.  KIRSTY stands up.

                             STEVE
                You're not going?

                             KIRSTY
                Just upstairs.

     She staggers a little bit.

                             STEVE
                Need any help?

                             KIRSTY
                I AM house-trained.

     Further hysteria.

                             STEVE
                       (covered in embarrass-
                        ment)
                No ... I meant ...

                             LARRY
                It's round on the left -

                             KIRSTY
                I know.

     She steps out into the hallway.


56   INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT

     She starts up the stairs.  She smiles to herself,
     thinking of STEVE.


57   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

     FRANK, in the corner of the room, watches JULIA, who is
     still at the door.

                             FRANK
                ... somebody ...

                             JULIA
                Ssh!

     The sound of KIRSTY downstairs, closing the bathroom
     door.

                             FRANK
                You can't let me stay like this.
                Please.  You can't.

                             JULIA
                What do you want me to do.

                             FRANK
                The blood brought me this far.
                I need more of the same.  Or
                I'll slip back ...

                                            CUT BACK TO

     JULIA's lace as she stares at FRANK once more.  She
     is appalled at the choice before her.

                             FRANK
                       (a plea)
                You have to heal me.


58   INT.   BATHROOM   NIGHT

     KIRSTY smiles at herself in the bathroom mirror, turns
     off the tap, opens the door and steps out onto the
     landing.


59   INT.   LOWER LANDING   NIGHT

     She takes a step along the landing, then realizes
     that there's somebody ahead of her, in the darkness.
     She stops.  From the floor above, a soft sigh.

                             KIRSTY
                Hello?

     JULIA moves out of shadow into a patch of patterned
     light splashing up the stair well.The effect recalls
     her memory of her lovemaking with FRANK.  The light
     makes her look strange; ominous.

                             KIRSTY
                Oh, it's you.

     JULIA doesn't smile

                Are you all right?

     Do we read murder in JULIA's eyes?  KIRSTY is uneasy.

     Suddenly, a voice from the floor below.

                             STEVE
                Kirsty?

     KIRSTY is relieved at the interruption.

                             KIRSTY
                       (calls down)
                I'm here.

                             STEVE
                I thought we'd lost you.

                             KIRSTY
                       (calls down)
                I'm coming!
                       (to Julia)
                Sleep well.

     JULIA is left on the landing, as KIRSTY heads downstairs.


60   EXT.   TUBE STATION   NIGHT

     The station is deserted, but for KIRSTY and STEVE,
     who are sitting, waiting for the last train.

                             KIRSTY
                You know I do know the way home.

                             STEVE
                It's late.

                             KIRSTY
                Not that late.

                             STEVE
                Please.  I want to see you
                home.  All right?

                             KIRSTY
                       (lightly)
                All right.
                       (smiles)
                No.  That's nice.

                             STEVE
                If there's a train.

                             KIRSTY
                What do we do if there isn't?

                             STEVE
                We walk.


61   EXT.   A PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL, NEAR WATERLOO   NIGHT

     KIRSTY and STEVE are walking.

                             STEVE
                Why don't you stay at Larry's
                house?  There's plenty of room.

                             KIRSTY
                Yeah, there's room.  And
                there's Julia.

                             STEVE
                I see.

                             KIRSTY
                She's so damn ... English.

                             STEVE
                Meaning what?

                             KIRSTY
                Oh, I don't know.  Up-tight.
                Frigid.

     STEVE stops walking.

                             STEVE
                I beg your pardon?

                             KIRSTY
                       (lightly)
                There ya go.
                       (imitates his tone)
                I beg your pardon?

                             STEVE
                We're not all frigid.

     KIRSTY has turned to look at him.  Both of them are
     aware where the banter is leading; smiles play on
     their faces as they speak.

                             KIRSTY
                Oh no?

                             STEVE
                Oh no.

                             KIRSTY
                It's not what I heard.

                             STEVE
                       (moves closer to
                        her)
                Well you've just been talking
                to the wrong people.

     He kisses her, with considerable feeling.


62   INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

     LARRY snores loudly.  JULIA lies beside him, wide
     awake, staring at the ceiling.

     LARRY turns over, muttering to himself.


63   INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

     The door opens.  JULIA is standing there, in her
     night-gown.

     FRANK raises his wretched head.

                             FRANK
                Well?

     JULIA stares at the thing moving in the shadow.

                             JULIA
                Yes.


64   EXT.   NUMBER 55    DAY

     The door opens.   JULIA steps out of the house, and
     starts towards the street.      As she does so,
     she glances round.


65   EXT.   WINDOW OF TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     We approach the window, knowing that FRANK watches
     behind it.


66   EXT.   NUMBER 55   DAY

     JULIA heads off down the street.


67   INT.   PIZZA RESTAURANT   DAY

     The din of a lunchtime restaurant, with all the tables
     full, and everyone hungry.   In the middle of the
     melee, KIRSTY is valiantly trying to do six things
     at once.  Somebody wants their order taken;  somebody
     else wants more lager;  somebody else is complaining.
     She's doing her best, but losing the battle.  She
     serves a table with their food, and then starts back
     to pick up another order.   As she does so she's
     harangued from every side.

                             1ST CUSTOMER
                Excuse me, Miss -

                             2ND CUSTOMER
                I'd like some more lager.

                             1ST CUSTOMER
                Miss!

                             KIRSTY
                In a moment.

                             2ND CUSTOMER
                Did you hear me?

     KIRSTY starts back to the counter.  As she does so
     somebody else's voice cuts through the din.

                             STEVE
                Hey, sex-bomb -

     She wheels round.

                             KIRSTY
                You keep your -
                       (sees Steve)
                Oh.
                       (smiles)
                Hi.

                             STEVE
                I just called in.  How about
                tonight?

                             KIRSTY
                I don't finish till twelve.

                             STEVE
                I'm a late riser.

     He grins.  She grins.

                             2ND CUSTOMER
                What do you have to do to get
                some service around here?

                             STEVE
                Catch you later.


68   INT.  BAR    DAY

     By contrast, a quiet bar.   Discreet music;  a well-dressed
     clientele.  Several couples occupy booths.  Other solitary
     drinkers are at the bar.

     Amongst them:   JULIA.

     Now we see her more closely, we realize she's gone to some
     considerable effort to make herself ravishing.  There's
     nothing crude about the change;  it's a subtle transformation
     which shows off her considerable beauty.  She drinks soda
     water.

     She has an admirer.   Sitting alone at one of the tables
     is a middle-aged man by the name of PRUDHOE, a nervous,
     slightly paunchy individual.  She glances over at him. His
     eyes don't leave her for a moment.  He's trying his best
     to get the courage to approach her.

     She looks away, and concentrates on her drink.  Now she
     takes out a cigarette, fumbling for it. Her hands are
     trembling slightly.  She lights the cigarette, draws on
     it, and as she does so she seems to make up her mind that
     she's not the equal of it.  She stubs the cigarette out,
     puts cash on the bar for her drinks, and gets up to leave.

     Suddenly, PRUDHOE's at her side.

                             PRUDHOE
                Not much fun, is it?

                             JULIA
                What?

                             PRUDHOE
                Drinking alone.

                             JULIA
                Not much.

                             PRUDHOE
                I wonder, maybe ...

     He's so nervous he can barely speak.

                ... as we're both on our own ...
                we could have one drink together?

     JULIA looks at him.  He seems to almost be offering
     himself to her.   There's a long pause, while she tries
     to make up her mind. Then:

                             JULIA
                Why not?

     She smiles.   The smile works wonders.  PRUDHOE's nerves
     diminish somewhat.  JULIA's simply increase, now that
     she's committed herself.  Again, she opens the pack of
     cigarettes, as PRUDHOE calls the BARMAN over.

                             PRUDHOE
                       (to Julia)
                What are you drinking?

                             JULIA
                Just soda.

                             PRUDHOE
                Plain soda?

                             JULIA
                Please.

                             PRUDHOE
                I try not to drink at lunch-
                time.  Makes me sleepy in the
                afternoon.  You like to keep
                a clear head, eh?
                       (to Barman)
                One soda, one whisky.
                       (to Julia)
                I do it anyway.  No will-power.
                Got a busy afternoon?

                             JULIA
                       (looking straight
                        at him)
                That depends.

                             PRUDHOE
                Oh?

     He stares at her, not certain he interprets her correctly.
     She stares back.  Then: the tiniest of smiles, which he
     - scarcely believing his luck - returns.


69   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     The CAMERA moves across the room. We can hear FRANK's
     ragged breathing, and as we move in we see, on the floor
     beside him, the box - the Lament Configuration - its
     sides gleaming.  FRANK, still squatting on the floor,
     taps a tattoo on the bare boards with his skeletal fingers.

     Then, voices outside:  JULIA laughs.

     He raises his head.


70   EXT.  DOORSTEP   DAY

     JULIA opens the front door.  She is still very nervous,
     fumbling with the keys.  PRUDHOE stands a pace behind her.


71   INT.  HALLWAY   DAY

     They step inside.   JULIA closes the door

                             PRUDHOE
                You know it's not often I ...
                you know ...

                             JULIA
                There's a first time for every-
                thing.

                             PRUDHOE
                I suppose that's right.

                             JULIA
                You want something to drink?

                             PRUDHOE
                I'm already way over my usual
                limit.  You know, it's funny.
                I feel like I've known you for
                years.

     He approaches her:  his gestures made slightly clumsy by
     the alcohol he's drunk.  He kisses her.  She presses him off
     her.

                             PRUDHOE
                Oh, come on.
                       (he takes hold of
                        her breast)
                It's what you brought me here
                for, isn't it?

                             JULIA
                Yes.  I just think we'd be
                better off upstairs.

                             PRUDHOE
                Oh.  Oh fine.


72   INT.  TORTUPE ROOM    DAY

     FRANK's view, from the corner of the room.  We hear the
     sound of JULIA and PRUDHOE's approach up the stairs.

                             PRUDHOE
                This your place?

                             JULIA
                Let's not talk about it.

                             PRUDHOE
                No personal details, right?

                             JULIA
                Right.

                             PRUDHOE
                You know, you're incredible -

     JULIA opens the door.

                             JULIA
                Come on in.  Make yourself at
                home.

     She steps inside.  PRUDHOE does as he's instructed.  He
     stares at the bare floor, as JULIA closes the door behind
     him.

                             PRUDHOE
                There's no bed.

                             JULIA
                That's right.

                             PRUDHOE
                Huh?

                             JULIA
                I prefer the floor.

                             PRUDHOE
                First time for everything, right?

                             JULIA
                Right.

     JULIA moves towards him

                             JULIA
                Why don't you take off your jacket?
                You're warm.

                             PRUDHOE
                Yeah, why don't I?

     She slips the knot of his tie.  We can hear her pulse on
     the soundtrack.  She glances over PRUDHOE's shoulder.  He
     follows her gaze, but she diverts him with a peck on the
     cheek.

                             PRUDHOE
                       (takes over his
                       undressing)
                Why don't you do the same?

                             JULIA
                Maybe I will.

     PRUDHOE, now starts to shed his jacket and trousers, trying
     not to take his eyes off JULIA for an instant.

     We watch from FRANK'S P.O.V. as he drops his underwear.
     He still wears his shirt, which he starts to unbutton.
     We move back into a tighter shot.

                             PRUDHOE
                       (voice slightly slurred)
                You know, you're very beautiful.

                             JULIA
                Am I?

                             PRUDHOE
                You know you are.  Loveliest
                woman I ever set eyes on.

     JULIA smiles.

     PRUDHOE stops unbuttoning his shirt.

                             PRUDHOE
                Oh Christ.

                             JULIA
                What's wrong?

                             PRUDHOE
                Too much drink.  Better empty
                my bladder.

     She steps out of the way so that he can cross to the door.

                             PRUDHOE
                I'll be a moment.

     As he moves to the door, she throws a piece of cloth off
     a hammer, which lies beside the wall.  PRUDHOE takes
     hold of the door handle.  Turns it:  it's stuck.

                             PRUDHOE
                The door's stuck.

     Before he can turn she hits him on the back of the head.
     He doesn't fall, but the blow sends blood down the back
     of his shirt.   To avoid the following blow he stumbles
     blindly towards the wall but JULIA's not going to be
     stopped now.  He holds the back of his head - dazed,
     apologetic, pitiful - while she moves towards him.

                             PRUDHOE
                Don't ... I ... please ...
                I'm sorry ...

     She eclipses him.

                ... I'm so sorry ...

     She raises the hammer.

                ... I don't understand ...

     She strikes him.  He slides down the wall, his jaw
     broken, blood pouring from his face.   He twitches.  Then
     the twitches stop.

     She drops the hammer, and stares down at the corpse.

                             JULIA
                Enough?

     The room sighs.   In the corner, FRANK's shadowy form
     leans forward.

                             FRANK
                Don't look at me.

     JULIA backs towards the door, as the broken, skeletal
     form crawls out of darkness to claim its sustenance.


73   INT.  UPPER LANDING    DAY

     JULIA steps out onto the landing and leans against the
     wall, waves of sheer relief breaking over her.

     In the room behind her, terrible sounds of feeding.


74   INT.  BATHROOM    DAY

     JULIA steps into the bathroom, and looks at herself in
     the mirror.   Blood is spattered on her face;  her hands
     are similarly stained.  She is trembling from head to
     foot.

     Stripping off her blouse, and flinging it over the side
     of the bath, she douses her face, neck and breasts with
     cold water.  Then she stares up at her face again,
     examining it.  She can scarcely believe what she's done.


75   INT.  LOWER LANDING    DAY

     She crosses the landing and climbs the stairs to the
     Torture Room.


76   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     She opens the door.

     As she does so FRANK retreats into the shadows.  We are
     granted a fleeting glimpse of him, his body fuller than
     before, but still horribly vulnerable.

     JULIA looks at PRUDHOE's corpse.  A trail of blood leads
     away from it into the darkness.  The body itself is a
     grotesquely misshapen husk now, the muscle and fat
     withered, the eyes sunk into the skull, the lips drawn
     back to expose the gums. A ghostly sight.

                             JULIA
                Jesus Christ.

     JULIA looks across at FRANK, who is no longer sitting,
     but standing in the shadows.

                             FRANK
                       (his voice stronger)
                Do I disgust you?

     She doesn't reply.

     He stretches his arm into a passage of light.  His flesh
     glistens and pulses.

                             FRANK
                See?   It's making me whole
                again.

     He turns his arm over for her appreciation.

                Every drop of blood you spill
                puts more flesh on my bones.
                And we both want that don't
                we?

     She nods.

                Good.  Come here.

     She stares, unable to move.

                Come here, damn you.  I want
                to touch you ...

     Still she doesn't move.

                             FRANK
                       (more softly)
                Come to Daddy.  I only want to
                touch ...

     She takes a step towards his outstretched arm.   His
     fingers touch her face.  She steels herself against them.
     Now, he starts to trace the line of her jaw, stroking
     her.  Now her lips, caressingly.

     Suddenly, a sound from downstairs.  The front door is
     opened.

                             LARRY
                       (from below)
                Sweetheart?

     JULIA withdraws from his touch

                             LARRY
                       (from below)
                Where are you?


77   INT.  HALLWAY    DAY

     Shot from the stairs of LARRY.  He looks up the flight.
     He takes a step towards the stairs.


78   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     JULIA takes a step backwards, her foot hitting PRUDHOE's
     corpse.


79   INT.  HALLWAY   DAY

     LARRY is still at the bottom of the stairs.

                             LARRY
                Are you there?

     For a moment it looks as though he's going to climb the
     stairs, then he thinks better of it, and goes through
     to the back of the house.


80   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     JULIA has wrapped the corpse of PRUDHOE up in its clothes
     and is now lifting it.  The body is lighter now, having
     been drained of nourishment.  Its head lolls back and its
     dentures drop out, hitting the floor loudly.  She freezes.
     No sound from below.  She backs out of the room with her
     burden.

     FRANK's arm reaches for the fallen dentures and peers at
     them.

                             FRANK
                Who's a pretty boy then?

     Soft laughter from the darkness.


81   INT.  JUNK ROOM    DAY

     JULIA pushes the door of the Junk Room, which is on the
     upper landing, open.  Inside, a chaos of tea-chests and
     bric-a-brac.  She lays the body down.


82   INT.  KITCHEN    DAY

     LARRY has come through to look for JULIA.  He hears a
     noise above.   He looks up.

                             LARRY
                       (quietly)
                Julia?

     He leaves the kitchen.


83   INT.  HALLWAY     DAY

     Again, LARRY Steps into the hallway, and gazes up the
     stairs.

                             LARRY
                Are you there?

     He starts up.


84   INT.  LOWER LANDING    DAY

     JULIA steps into the bathroom, and then locks the door
     behind her.

     LARRY ascends to the top of the stairs.

                             LARRY
                Julia?

                             JULIA
                       (from bathroom)
                I'm here.

                             LARRY
                       (at the door)
                Sweetheart ... I've been
                calling you.

     He tries the door.  It's locked.

                Are you all right?

                             JULIA
                Just feeling a bit sick.

                             LARRY
                Oh, babe ...


85   INT.  BATHROOM    DAY

     JULIA, still trembling, sits on the edge of the bath.

                             JULIA
                I'll be O.K.  Just leave me
                be a while.

                             LARRY
                Can I get you anything?

                             JULIA
                Maybe a brandy.

                             LARRY
                Sure.

                             JULIA
                I'll be down in a minute

                             LARRY
                O.K.

     She listens as his footsteps recede down the landing and
     stairs.    Then she crosses to the mirror and tries to
     erase the signs of panic.  She puts a comb through her
     hair, and adjusts her blouse.  That done, she unbolts the
     door and steps out into the landing.  She doesn't go down
     however, but UP,  back to the Torture Room.


86   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     She opens the door.

                             JULIA
                       (very softly)
                Frank?

     A crunching sound in the shadows.  FRANK's hand opens,
     dropping the pieces of PRUDHOE's dentures, which he has
     crushed, onto the floor, in a rain of plastic teeth.

                             FRANK
                I'm hurting

                             JULIA
                Hurting.

                             FRANK
                My nerves ... are beginning
                to work again.

                             JULIA
                Good.

                             FRANK
                One more.  Maybe two -

     JULIA's face registers no horrer at this.

                - to heal me completely.   Then
                we can be away from here, before
                they come looking.

                             JULIA
                Who?

                             FRANK
                The Cenobites.  It's only a matter
                of time before they find I've
                slipped them. I have to get away
                from here.

     From downstairs, LARRY.

                             LARRY
                Julia?   Are you all right?

     JULIA crosses to the door and calls down.

                             JULIA
                Just a moment.  Put on some
                music will you babe?

                             LARRY
                O.K.

     She returns to her conversation with FRANK.

                             FRANK
                Poor Larry.  Obedient as ever.

                             JULIA
                Keep your voice down.

     She crosses to close the door.   When she turns round,
     he's in front of her, silhouetted against the window,
     his half-formed face terrifying in the gloom.  Suddenly
     he reaches out and catches hold of her arm.  She gasps
     in pain.

                             FRANK
                Ssh. Don't want babe to hear.

                             JULIA
                You're hurting.

                             FRANK
                You won't cheat me will you?
                You'll stay with me.  Help me.
                Then we can be together, the
                way we were before.  We belong
                to each other now, for better
                or worse ...

     He lets go of her.

                ... like love.  Only real.

     She goes to the door, and leaves him, locking it behind
     her.

     We move close to FRANK's face.   He licks his skinned
     lips with a bloody tongue.  Thunder rolls.


87   KIRSTY'S DREAM

     The thunder carries over to a dream.

     We are in the Dining Room of Number 55, except that
     everything is once more shrounded in sheets.

     We CUT to KIRSTY, moving through the room, her face pale,
     her hair glued to her forehead with sweat.

     Somewhere, a bell is ringing.  Flies buzz.  On the
     dinner table, a form is covered in a sheet.  It's clear
     that the shape is human.  She reaches the table, and
     looks at the body.

     Suddenly, blood begins to seep through the shroud, beginning
     at the head - eyes and mouth - then spreading across the
     body.  There are sobs beneath the shroud.

     She reaches for it, to snatch it off the body.

     The blood has almost turned the sheet scarlet.

     She pulls.

     We glimpse only a moment of what'd beneath: a naked
     body, scarlet and shining with blood from head to foot.

     She screams.

     Her scream becomes louder, as we

                                               CUT TO

88   INT.  KIRSTY'S ROOM    NIGHT

     STEVE sits bolt upright in bed, while KIRSTY yells.

     The sheet is snatched off him.  He looks across the room
     to see KIRSTY at the end of the bed, with the sheet in
     her hand.

                             STEVE
                What are you doing?

     KIRSTY's eyes are still closed.

                Kirsty!

     Her eyes open.  She looks down at the sheet she's snatched
     from the bed, and drops it in horror.

                             STEVE
                Christ.  What was that about?

     KIRSTY, weak with fear, just shakes her head.


89   INT.  HALLWAY, NUMBER 55    NIGHT

     A phone is ringing.

     LARRY crosses the hallway, bleary-eyed, and disappears
     from sight.   The phone is picked up.

                             LARRY'S VOICE
                Hello?


90   INT.  BEDROOM    NIGHT

     JULIA lies in bed, the pillow empty beside her.   She's
     wide awake, staring at the ceiling.   Downstairs, the
     murmur of LARRY's voice.


91   INT.  TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

     FRANK stands in the corner of the room, breathing softly
     in the shadows.


92   INT.  TELEPHONE ROOM   NIGHT

     LARRY is on the phone.

                             LARRY
                I'm O.K., honey.  It's all
                right ...


93   INT.  KIRSTY'S ROOM    NIGHT

     KIRSTY is on the phone.   STEVE sits up in bed, having
     reclaimed the sheet.

                             KIRSTY
                I just wanted to be sure you
                were O.K.


94   INT.  TELEPHONE ROOM    NIGHT

                             LARRY
                Never better.  You sleep well.

                             KIRSTY (on phone)
                Yeah.

                             LARRY
                I love you, honey.

                             KIRSTY (on phone)
                I love you too.

     LARRY puts down the phone.


95   INT.  LOWER LANDING    DAY

     LARRY returns to the bedroom.

                             JULIA (O.S.)
                Who was it?

                             LARRY
                Kirsty.

     He goes into the bedroom.

     We PAN up the second flight of stairs.

     FRANK is sitting at the top, in the shadows.

                             FRANK
                       (soft as a breath)
                Kirsty.


96   INT.  HALLWAY    DAY

     The front door is closed by JULIA.   A man stands in
     the hallway:  another VICTIM.   He is as nervous as
     PRUDHOE.

                             VICTIM
                You're sure we're not going to
                be interrupted -

                             JULIA
                Quite sure.

                             VICTIM
                Only I like to be careful.


97   INT.  TORTURE ROOM    DAY

     A shock CUT to the naked VICTIM, thrown back against
     the wall from JULIA's hammer blow.  Before he can even
     slide down the wall, FRANK is upon him.

     We don't linger, but CUT away to:


98   INT.  LANDING    DAY

     As JULIA closes the door, her face devoid of emotion,
     we see the VICTIM's body on the floor, with FRANK's
     hands oh its head, draining out its energies.


99   INT.  DINING ROOM    DAY

     JULIA sits, sipping a drink, her face still unreadable.


100  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     FRANK is standing in the shadows.  The VICTIM's body
     is in the middle of the room.

     JULIA enters.

                             JULIA
                Well?

                             FRANK
                Better.  Much better.  I'd
                like some clothes.  And maybe
                a cigarette.

                             JULIA
                Then you tell me ... you
                explain what happened to you?

                             FRANK
                Of course.


101  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     We pan across the walls as FRANK speaks.

                             FRANK (O.S.)
                I wanted access to experiences ...
                pleasures ... that only they
                could offer ...

                             JULIA (O.S.)
                The Cenobites.

                             FRANK
                That's what they call themselves.
                They're not human.  Maybe they
                were once, but they're not now.
                They rearrange their own flesh
                for pleasure.

     We've moved across to FRANK now.  He is dressed,
     in loose fitting jacket and trousers, through which
     his blood is seeping.  He smokes, taking great
     pleasure in the experience.

                             JULIA
                And the box?

     FRANK picks up the box.  Vague, tantalizing forms
     move over the surface, like ghosts.

                             FRANK
                It cost me a fortune.  All I
                had.  It's a puzzle you see.
                You solve it, and the Cenobites
                come through ...

                             JULIA
                Where from?

                             FRANK
                God knows.  Sometimes I think
                they're just behind the walls ...

     He turns the box over.  The lacquer catches the light.

                             JULIA
                So they cheated you

     In the lacquer we see oiled bodies moving.  It's
     difficult to be sure what the forms signify.  Is
     this torture, or some elaborate pleasure?

                             FRANK
                Oh no.  They kept to their
                bargain.  They gave me
                experiences I'd never forget ...

     The images in the lacquer are becoming clearer, and
     they are APPALLING.  Flesh torn open; blood running
     across sweating flesh; hooks, and terrible machines.

                             FRANK
                But their pleasure was my pain.

     His voice has begun to tremble.  The images in the
     box are more horrific by the moment.  And flowing
     between them, highly distorted, the CENOBITE's
     faces, and that of FRANK, screaming and screaming.

                             FRANK
                Terrible pain.  Appalling ...

     He can't speak for a moment.  After a pause, he goes
     on, his voice heavy.

                My body was forfeit.  But my
                spirit ... they left that here.
                In the boards.  In the walls.
                Watching the world, but never
                able to touch it ...

                             JULIA
                And the blood let you out?

                             FRANK
                There are ways to resurrection.
                Blood's one of them.  I won't
                let them take me back, Julia.

     JULIA looks at the horrors in the box, and understands
     his desire.

                             FRANK
                I want to be whole, and then
                get out -

     He lifts the box up.

                I won't let them take me.

                             JULIA
                You won't have to.  We'll be
                gone.  Somewhere they'll
                never find us.

     There's a rumble of thunder.

                Not in the whole wide world.


102  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT

     More thunder, and the sound of heavy rain against the
     windows.

     The television is on.  LARRY and JULIA are sitting on
     the couch.  LARRY is watching a boxing match.  He
     has consumed several beers:  the cans are beside
     his feet; and there's another in his hand.

     JULIA reads a magazine, glancing up at the screen
     to see the match getting more heated.  Blood is
     starting to flow.

                             LARRY
                Is this upsetting you?

                             JULIA
                I've seen worse.

     LARRY looks at her.

                             LARRY
                Are you all right?

                             JULIA
                Fine.

                             LARRY
                Only I'll turn it off -

     There's a sudden raising of shouts from the screen,
     as one of the boxers hits the canvas.  LARRY
     turns his attention back to the match.

                             COMMENTATOR
                And he's down!  He's down!

     The thunder rolls on.


103  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT

     The lightning finds its way through the holes in
     the newspaper.  FRANK is watching through the window,
     his face occasionally washed with light.  His hand,
     on the window frame, taps out the same tattoo he's
     tapped out before.  He turns away from the window,
     and his foot catches the box.  It rolls across the
     floor.


104  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT

     The boxing match is heating up again.

                             COMMENTATOR
                - and now he's in trouble,
                he's really in trouble - 

                             LARRY
                What was that?

     JULIA looks up from her magazine.

                             JULIA
                Thunder.

     The violence on the screen is horrific, as swollen
     faces burst beneath punches.

                             LARRY
                No.  Something else.

     LARRY stands up.

                             JULIA
                Maybe I left a window open -

     She gets up and crosses to the door.

                - I'll go see.

                             LARRY
                No.  I'll do it.

     He opens the door, and steps out into the hallway.


105  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

     In such tight close up we can't sec that FRANK has
     in fact left the Torture Room, we see his features
     register that somebody is coming.


106  INT.   STAIRWAY   NIGHT

     LARRY is climbing the stairs.  JULIA follows.

                             JULIA
                It was nothing.

     LARRY has reached the top of the stairs.  He looks up
     the next flight.

                Larry ...

                             LARRY
                What's wrong with you?

     She's desperate to stop him climbing to the Torture
     Room.

                             JULIA
                I just hate the thunder.

     He crosses to her.

                             LARRY
                I'm here.

     He puts his arms around her.  She responds.

                You're shaking.

     He hugs her tight, kissing her lightly. The thunder
     shakes the house.

                There's nothing to be afraid
                of.

     He kisses her neck, his hands restless on her.

                I'll just go check upstairs ...

     He kisses her again.  She, in order to distract him,
     kisses him back.  Her passion is artificial, but he
     doesn't register that.

                             LARRY
                Oh baby.

                             JULIA
                Don't go upstairs.

                             LARRY
                Come with me then.

     He starts up the stairs.

                             JULIA
                Please ...


107  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

     He reaches the top of the stairs.  First he throws
     open the Junk Room.  Lightning flashes on boxes
     inside.  Then he moves towards the Torture Room.
     The thunder rolls more loudly.

     She follows him along the landing, desperate to stop
     him.

     Too late.  He throws open the door.

                             JULIA
                Don't.

     Lightning floods the room.  It's empty.  She stands
     beside him at the door.

                             LARRY
                We must have rats.

     She looks back down the stairs.  Where's FRANK gone?
     LARRY turns to her, holding her again, on the
     threshold of the Torture Room.

                             LARRY
                See?  Quite safe.

     He kisses her, much harder this time; a sexual kiss.

                Let's go  down.  I'll make it
                better.

     He kisses her again.


108  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

     A shadow moves across the screen as the door opens,
     and LARRY puts on the light. He has hold of JULIA's
     hand.  He leads her inside.  She sits on the bed,
     illuminated by the light from the landing, and the
     occasional flicker from the window.  LARRY kneels
     between her legs, and kisses her breasts, his eyes
     closed.

     JULIA glances into the shadows of the room.  She
     senses FRANK's presence.

                             LARRY
                ... oh babe ...

     He starts to unbutton her dress.  She's distracted
     by her suspicions; he has his hands against her
     almost before she realizes what's happening.

     We have her P.O.V. as she looks around the room.  The
     dressing table; the wardrobe; the curtains at the
     window.  Does something move in the shadows?

     A flash of lightning.  No.  There's nothing.

     LARRY gets onto the bed and draws her against him,
     kissing her.  This is not the intense, slightly
     dangerous love-making she experienced with FRANK,
     but a fumbling, slightly foolish exchange.  LARRY is
     so wrapped in attempting to make the right moves he
     doesn't register the fact that JULIA's attention is
     elsewhere.

     Now we have a P.O.V. from the far side of the room, of
     the two figures on the bed, the only sound the thunder
     and LARRY's murmured words of seduction, which we
     can barely make out.

                             LARRY
                ...I love you, honey ... let
                me ... oh God ... I love you ...

     Neither of them have undressed fully; there's just a
     tangle of clothes around them which removes any trace
     of eroticism from the scene.

     A CLOSE UP of JULIA's head, laid on the pillow, shows
     just how uninvolved she is - while LARRY works, eyes
     closed.  JULIA looks down the length of her husband's
     body.  The door of the wardrobe swings open.  FRANK
     is watching.  She registers horror.  LARRY is oblivious
     to all of this, of course.

     We have a CLOSE UP of FRANK watching the love-making.
     Now he steps out of the wardrobe.  JULIA makes a moan
     of horror, which LARRY takes as enthusiasm.

                             LARRY
                Oh baby ... I love you ...

     From JULIA'S P.O.V., we see the form of FRANK shamble
     towards the lovers.

     From FRANK'S P.O.V. we see the lovers on the bed,
     LARRY's back vunerable.  JULIA seems to realize what
     he intends.

                             JULIA
                ... no ...

     LARRY barely hears her.

     FRANK is at the very end of the bed now, and JULIA
     becomes highly agitated.

                             JULIA
                No.  No, you mustn't.  PLEASE.
                No.

     LARRY stops his love-making.

                             LARRY
                       (looks at her)
                Huh?

                             JULIA
                Please ...

                             LARRY
                What's wrong with you?

                             JULIA
                       (almost sobbing)
                Please.  I can't bear it ...

     LARRY is angered and utterly perplexed at this.  He
     disengages his arms from around her.

     JULIA'S P.O.V., as FRANK retreats.

     LARRY rolls off JULIA.

     The wardrobe door closes.  Click.

                             LARRY
                I don't understand you.  One
                moment you're all over me, the
                next it's:  Don't touch me.

     He sits on the edge of the bed.

                I just don't understand.

     He gets up and leaves the bedroom.  JULIA remains where
     she is.  We have a shot of the bed, and her upon it,
     from FRANK's end of the room.  She stares at the
     wardrobe.  Through the crack of the open door, FRANK
     stares back.  A flicker of lightning illuminates his
     face; his skeletal grin.

     Softly, beneath the assault of the rain on the roof,
     we hear laughter.


109  INT.   A SMALL RESTAURANT   EVENING

     KIRSTY and LARRY are sitting eating a meal together,
     in an intimate restaurant.  LARRY has little appetite,
     to judge by his plate.  He looks as if he hasn't slept
     for several nights.  KIRSTY, by contrast, is sparkling

                             LARRY
                ... maybe we should never
                have come back.

                             KIRSTY
                Maybe you should give it some
                time.

                             LARRY
                I guess.

                             KIRSTY
                       (skirting her real
                       feelings)
                She's not like Mom.  She's ...
                I don't know ... moody.  I thought
                that was what you liked about her.

                             LARRY
                You don't like her at all do you?

     The straight-forward question silences KIRSTY for a
     moment.  She wants to be delicate with her father's
     feelings, but honest at the same time.

                             KIRSTY
                I don't know her.  She's so ...
                sealed up.

     LARRY's face is full of the desire for reassurance.
     KIRSTY tries to offer it.

                If YOU love her she must be
                worth loving.  Just give me
                some time.

     LARRY nods, a weak smile on his face

                             LARRY
                She doesn't even want to leave
                the house.

                             KIRSTY
                Really?

                             LARRY
                It's like she's waiting for
                something.

                             KIRSTY
                What?

                             LARRY
                I don't know.  I don't know.
                It's beyond me.

     A silence.

                             LARRY
                       (hesitant)
                Would you ... maybe call round
                sometime?  Try to make friends.

                             KIRSTY
                Sure.

                             LARRY
                Maybe all she needs is some
                company.


110  INT.   STAIRCASE   DAY

     FRANK is standing at the top of the stairs, dressed in
     his stained suit.  JULIA is a few steps down, staring
     up at him.

                             FRANK
                You can't love him.

                             JULIA
                I don't.

                             FRANK
                So where's the harm?

                             JULIA
                I said no.

                             FRANK
                Then find me somebody else, 
                before they come looking.

     JULIA nods.

                Tomorrow?

     She looks at him.


111  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET - DAY

     A wind blows, carrying autumn leaves before it.  And
     on the wind, the distant pealing of bells.


112  EXT.   DOORSTEP OF NUMBER 55   DAY

     JULIA is at the door, turning the key in the lock.
     Beside her, a third sacrificial lamb, balding and
     excitable.  His name is SYKES.

     JULIA opens the door.


113  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   DAY

     At the corner of the street now:  KIRSTY.  She watches,
     puzzled.


114   EXT.   DOORSTEP OF NUMBER 55   DAY

     A long shot of the house, from KIRSTY'S P.O.V.  The
     man on the step seems to having second thoughts.
     JULIA speaks with him.  We can hear none of this
     exchange, but JULIA manages to coax him inside.  She
     closes the door behind them.


115  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   DAY

     KIRSTY stands, bewildered by what she's seen.


116  INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     From the top of the stairs we watch JULIA lead SYKES
     upstairs.

                             SYKES
                I get lonely sometimes.

                             JULIA
                Everybody does.


117  EXT.   STREET   DAY

     KIRSTY starts towards the house.


118  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     In the corner of the room FRANK stands, tapping out
     the rhythm with his fingers.  It's 'Colonel Bogey',
     and now he hums it too.  Outside the door, a footfall.

                             JULIA
                Come in.

     The humming stops.

     JULIA opens the door.


119  EXT.   FRONT OF HOUSE   DAY

     KIRSTY starts down the path.


120  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     SYKES is looking at JULIA.

                             SYKES
                What is this?  A game?

     FRANK moves in the corner.  SYKES catches the motion
     from the corner of his eye.  He turns.

                What ?

     FRANK steps from the shadows.

                Jesus Christ.

     JULIA hits him with the hammer.


121  EXT.   DOORSTEP   DAY

     KIRSTY hears SYKES scream.  She freezes.  Then steps
     back from the doorstep and looks up at the house.


122  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     In the Room, pandemonium.  SYKES, blood pouring down
     his face, flails out at JULIA.  The hammer flies from
     her hand.  He lunges for the door, but she manages
     to kick it closed.

                             SYKES
                Christ help me!


123  EXT.   HOUSE   DAY

     KIRSTY makes her way around the back of the house.


124  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     SYKES has taken hold of JULIA, and is using her as
     a shield against FRANK, whos is bearing down upon
     him.  For the first time we see FRANK's true colours
     where JULIA's concerned -

                             SYKES
                       (to Frank)
                Don't!

     Casually, FRANK throws JULIA aside.  She falls, sobbing.

     FRANK descends on SYKES.

                             SYKES
                No!


125  INT.   KITCHEN   DAY

     SYKES' scream covers the sound of KIRSTY forcing the
     back door open.  She steps inside.


126  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     FRANK has SYKES face to the wall.  SYKES is sobbing now.
     The room is covered in blood.

                             FRANK
                       (to Julia)
                Get out of here.

     She picks herself up.

                             SYKES
                       (to Julia)
                Please ... don't let him kill
                me ... please ...

     JULIA leaves, closing the door.

     FRANK seizes hold of SYKE's neck, his fingers entering
     the flesh either side of his neck vertebrae.  SYKES screams.


127  INT.   KITCHEN/DINGING ROOM/HALLWAY   DAY

     KIRSTY moves through the house, and starts to climb the
     stairs.


128  INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     Half way up the stairs, the scream stops.  She climbs
     the rest of the way surrounded by a graveyard hush.


129  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     A soundless, slowed shot, as SYKES, his face wasted
     by FRANK's feeding, breaks from FRANK's hold and
     lunges for the door.


130  INT.   LOWER LANDING   DAY

     KIRSTY starts up the second flight of stairs.


131  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     The same slowed, soundless horror, as SYKES reaches
     the door.  FRANK is a pace behind him.


132  INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY

     KIRSTY reaches the top as -


133  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     The door from inside the room.  SYKES pulls it open -


134  INT.   TORTURE ROOM FROM LANDING   DAY

     In real time, and accompanied by the most horrific
     shriek, SYKES flings himself from the Torture Room.
     The flesh is hanging off his face; his eyes bulge
     in terror.

     Seeing KIRSTY he starts towards her.  Behind him,
     FRANK, his body glistening.  He catches hold of SYKES
     by the neck. SYKES'  shrieks stop.  The eyes glaze
     over.  The body judders as death claims it.  Then
     FRANK drops the corpse, and looks up at KIRSTY.

                             KIRSTY
                Oh my God.

     She starts to back away down the stairs.

                             KIRSTY
                       (shouts)
                Julia!

                             FRANK
                Kirsty?

     He takes a step towards her.

                             KIRSTY
                Keep your fucking distance.
                Julia!  Where's Julia?  Christ,
                what have you done with her.

     She's still backing away. He's still advancing.

                             FRANK
                Kirsty.  It's Frank.  It's
                Uncle Frank.

                             KIRSTY
                No.

                             FRANK
                You remember.

                             KIRSTY
                No.

                             FRANK
                Come to Daddy.

     Her puzzlement, however, has slowed her retreat, 
     and now FRANK reaches for her.  At the last moment
     she backs away again, but he's after her in a beat,
     and seizes hold of her.

                             KIRSTY
                No.  Get the fuck off me.

     He drags her back up the stairs.


135  INT.   TORTURE ROOM   DAY

     He pushes her ahead of him, into the Torture Room.  He
     closes the door.

                             FRANK
                You've grown.  You're beautiful.

     She has retreated as far from him as she can get.  He
     advances on her.

                             KIRSTY
                Don't touch me.  Or so help
                me -

                             FRANK
                What?  What will you do?  What
                can you do?
                       (pause)
                There's nothing to be frightened
                of.

     FRANK has closed in on her by now.  He Lakes hold
     of her face.

                             FRANK
                I bet you make your Daddy proud,
                don't you?  Beautiful.

                             KIRSTY
                This isn't happening.

                             FRANK
                I used to tell myself that.
                Used to try and pretend I was
                dreaming all the pain.  But why
                kid yourself?  Some things have
                to be endured.  Take it from me.
                And that makes the pleasures so
                much sweeter ...

     As he leans in to kiss her she snatches hold of the
     pus and bloodstained shirt that's glued to his
     abdomen, and PULLS.  There's a flow of fluids.
     FRANK's head is thrown back, and he screams.
     She slips from beneath his grasp.  But he's after
     her in a moment, his hand catching her blouse.  It
     tears.  His fingers rake her bare skin.

     She stumbles, reaches out for the wall, which is
     slick with SYKES' blood.  Her hand slides over
     it.  She falls, heavily.

     Roaring, FRANK comes in pursuit of her.

     On the floor in front of KIRSTY:  the box.  It's a
     poor weapon, but it's all she's got.  As he comes
     after her again, she stands up and delivers a blow
     to his head with the box.  He howls.  She races for
     the door.  But he's after her.  He strikes her.
     She's thrown against the wall.  He's FURIOUS now.
     Strikes her again.  She cannot survive much more.

     She raises the box to retaliate.   FRANK sees what
     she's holding.  His  attack stops.

                             FRANK
                Give that to me.

     She dimly realizes that she has a bargaining tool.

                             KIRSTY
                       (breathless)
                No.

                             FRANK
                One last time.  Give me the
                box.

                             KIRSTY
                You want it?

     The monster's eyes glitter.

                Fucking have it!

     She throws the box.  It sails past FRANK and smashes
     through the window.

                             FRANK
                NO!

     He goes to the window.  She takes her chance.  She's
     out of the door in a moment.

                NO!


136  INT.   UPPER LANDING   DAY

     KIRSTY propels herself out of the Room, and down the
     stairs, while FRANK vents his anger above her.


137  INT.   HALLWAY   DAY

     She flings open the front door, and pitches herself -
     bleeding and bruised - into the daylight beyond.


138  EXT.   NUMBER 55   DAY

     As she stumbles away down the path, she sees the box
     at her feet, in a litter of broken glass.  She picks
     it up, and continues to run.


139  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   DAY

     A series of shots from KIRSTY'S P.O.V., as she staggers
     along the street.  The sound-track whines; the image
     threatens to be eclipsed by darkness.  People stare
     at her as she runs.  A child points.

     Finally, the CAMERA slows.  She stands still.

     A voice, off camera:

                             VOICE (O.S.)
                Are you all right?

     The CAMERA swings giddily around in the direction of
     the speaker.  A WOMAN comes into view.

                             WOMAN
                Do you need any help?

     As she speaks, the picture fades to white.


140  KIRSTY'S DREAM  (PART TWO)

     The whiteness continues to fill the screen.  Distant,
     incoherent voices are heard, and the thump of blood
     in the inner ear.

     Then darkness seeps into the whiteness, patterns like
     Rorschach inkblots: ambiguous, yet interpretable as
     sexual or horrific imagery.  With the darkness,
     soaking over the scene like blood through the sheet
     in her first dream, fragments of FRANK's previous
     dialogue.

                             FRANK
                Come to Daddy.

                             KIRSTY
                This isn't happening.

                             FRANK
                Some things have to be endured ...

     The darkness is filling the screen

                ... take it from me ...

     Now, total darkness.

                ... Come to Daddy ...

     And suddenly, she wakes.


141  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

     KIRSTY is lying in a bed in a private room.  A NURSE
     is at her bedside, monitoring her condition.

                             NURSE
                You're awake.

     She goes to the door.

                I'll get the doctor.

     She exits.

     KIRSTY tries to sit up.  Her head hurts, badly.  As she
     achieves a sitting position, the door opens.  The
     NURSE returns, with a DOCTOR.

                             DOCTOR
                       (approaching the bed)
                So ... you're back with us.

                             KIRSTY
                I think so.

                             DOCTOR
                How are you feeling?

                             KIRSTY
                Tender.

                             DOCTOR
                You took quite a beating.  Do
                you remember what happened?

     She looks at him, uncertain of where to start.

                             KIRSTY
                I want to speak to my father ...

                             DOCTOR
                       (nods)
                Of course.  We'll bring you a
                telephone.

     The NURSE exits.  The DOCTOR brings the box from his
     pocket.

                Maybe this'll jog your memory.

     He lays it on the bed.  She stares at it, her expression
     betraying nothing.

                I had the Devil's own job
                getting it out of your hand.
                Does it ring any bells?

     She shakes her head.

                Do you want it left?

                             KIRSTY
                Why not?

     He offers her a reassuring smile.

                             DOCTOR
                Chin up.  There's no serious
                damage.  And you're safe here.

                             KIRSTY
                Um.

     He leaves the room.

     KIRSTY picks up the box, tentatively.  She turns it
     over in her hand, examining it.


142  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

     FRANK is standing in the shadows.  He is wearing a
     fresh shirt.  He smirks.   JULIA watches him.

     Downstairs, the telephone rings.  JULIA is very
     nervous now; desperate even.

                             JULIA
                She'll tell them everything ...

                             FRANK
                I don't think so.  She'll want
                Larry first.

                             JULIA
                That's probably her now.  Or
                the police.

                             FRANK
                Maybe.

                             JULIA
                Don't you care?

                             FRANK
                There's very little I can do
                about it.

                             JULIA
                Maybe we should just leave -

                             FRANK
                Like this?  Look at me! LIKE
                THIS?

                             JULIA
                Well we can't just stay here -

                             FRANK
                I need a skin.  Then we leave -


143  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

     KIRSTY is sitting up in bed.  On the bedside table,
     a telephone.  She is now thoroughly engrossed in the
     problems of the box.  Her fingers speed over the
     surfaces, looking for some way in, testing its
     strength.

     Suddenly, a click.  Her face lights up with pleasure,
     as she slides a part of the box open, revealing new
     intricacies.  And to accompany the revelation, a
     tinkling tune.

     She smiles.  It's a musical box.

     The light beside the bed flickers, but she doesn't
     notice.

     The door opens.  It's the NURSE.

                             NURSE
                Comfortable?

                             KIRSTY
                       (smiles)
                Sure.

                             NURSE
                Any luck with your father?

                             KIRSTY
                       (shakes her head)
                He's probably got a meeting.
                I called a friend of mine.  He's
                coming; is that O.K.?

                             NURSE
                Of course.

     The NURSE exits.  As she does go the light flickers again.
     The box clicks.  A new facet is revealed ...

     KIRSTY smiles.


144  EXT.   NUMBER 55   NIGHT

     The front door closes.

                             LARRY
                       (inside)
                Julia?


145  INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT

     LARRY stands in the hall.  JULIA comes down the stairs.
     She looks pale; even ill.

                             LARRY
                What's wrong?

                             JULIA
                I don't know where to begin ...

                             LARRY
                What are you talking about?

                             JULIA
                It's better you see for your-
                self -

     She turns and starts up the stairs.  He follows.


146  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

     KIRSTY has opened more of the box.  The tune is more
     complex now.

     Somewhere a bell has started to ring.  Now, she works
     the final mechanism of the box.  The bedside light
     flickers and goes out.

     The bell rings.  Light pours out of the box.  She
     drops it, shocked.

     The bedside light comes on again.

     She looks up.

     In the wall opposite the end of her bed, a very narrow
     doorway has simply opened in the wall.

     Leaving the box on the bed, she gets up and goes to
     the gap.  As she approaches she hears the distant,
     rhythmical sob of a baby.  She stands at the doorway.


147  INT.   CORRIDOR TO HELL   NIGHT

     We look back at her, a diminutive figure framed against
     a shot of light, from way, way down the corridor.


148  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

     The sobbing goes on.  KIRSTY stares down the corridor -
     which is lit brightly in some places, and is absolutely
     dark in others - not certain of whether to venture down
     it or not.

     She glances towards the door of her room, from the other
     side of which comes the reassuring sound of the hospital
     going about its business.  What's to fear?


149  INT.   CORRIDOR TO HELL   NIGHT

     She steps into the corridor.    The walls rise into
     darkness on either side of her, their surfaces like
     the interior of a pyramid, pitted with age, and
     rotting away.

     She starts towards the sobbing child, bare feet on
     the impacted earth of the passageway.

     The sobbing gets louder as she advances, her form
     disappearing entirely as she passes through the
     intermittent darkness.

     Once, she glances back towards the Hospital Room, to
     reassure herself that it's still there.  It is,
     though it's no more than a sliver of light at the
     far end of the passageway.

     She advances a few more paces.  The atmosphere is
     growing denser; smoke thickens the air.

     Then, a light glows at the other end of the corridor.

     The sound of the sobbing child ceases.

     She stops walking.

     Ahead, the smoke clears and the light brightens, and we
     see a creature - THE ENGINEER - hanging in the space
     between the walls.  It is in silhouette against the
     light, but we can see enough to know that it resembles
     no earthly animal.  Its vast black limbs hold it
     suspended above the corridor, clinging to the stone.
     Its front limbs, vestigial by comparison, hang down
     from beneath its vast head.  Its tail is curled over
     its back.

     KIRSTY's expression registers this horror.  THE ENGINEER
     moves into the light.  Its irises narrow to slits.
     From the tail a vast sting, oozing pus - like venom,
     glides into view.

     And then -

     - it comes at her, advancing along the corridor by
     bracing its legs against the walls.  Its breath is a
     growl in its belly, until it moves into darkness, when
     all sound from it ceases, only to erupt  again as it
     finds the light.

     KIRSTY turns, and starts to run.

     It comes after her at speed.   Darkness, light, darkness,
     light; roars and silence -

     Its jaws spill its thick saliva; its eyes gleam.

     KIRSTY runs blindly down the corridor, back towards the
     safety of the Hospital Room.   But it's very close on her
     heels, lingering -

     As she comes within a few yards of the Room it closes
     on her.


150  INT.   HOSPITAL ROOM   NIGHT

     She flings herself through the door with THE ENGINEER's
     breath on her back, and turns -

     The doorway has gone.  The wall is sealed.  She approaches
     the wall.   THE ENGINEER scratches on the other side ...

     Then, she realises that the bell is still ringing.  And
     there's a foul smell in the air.

     She looks around.

     She's not alone.

     Standing across the room from her, lit by a strange
     phosphorescence that has no visible source, are four
     extraordinary figures.

     They are CENOBITES.   Each of them is horribly mutilated
     by systems of hooks and pins.  The garments they wear
     are elaborately constructed to marry with their flesh,
     laced through skin in places, hooked into bone.

     The leader of this quartet has pins driven into his head
     at inch intervals.  At his side, a woman whose neck is
     pinned open like a vivisection specimen.  Accompanying
     them is a creature whose mouth is wired into a gaping
     rectangle - the exposed teeth sharpened to points, and
     a fat sweating monster whose eyes are covered by dark
     glasses.

     When the lead CENOBITE speaks, we recognise the voice as
     that of the creature from the beginning of the film.

     KIRSTY stares in amazement.

                             KIRSTY
                Where the hell did you come from?

     The CENOBITE gestures.  The box is lying on the bed.

                             CENOBITE
                The box ... you opened it.
                We came.

                             KIRSTY
                It's just a puzzle box.

                             CENOBITE
                It's a means to summon us -
                it's called the Lament Con-
                figuration.

                             KIRSTY
                Who are you?

                             CENOBITE
                Cenobites.  Explorers in the
                further regions of experience.
                Demons to some.  Angels to
                others.

                             KIRSTY
                Well, I didn't mean to open
                that thing.  You can go back
                wherever you came from.

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                We can't.   Not alone.

     At this, the creature with the wired open jaw chatters
     like a mad monkey.

                             KIRSTY
                This isn't for real.

                             CENOBITE
                You solved the box.  We came.
                Now you must come with us.
                Taste our pleasures.

     The chattering CENOBITE steps towards her.

                             KIRSTY
                Don't touch me!

     The door opens.  It's STEVE.

     KIRSTY's face floods with relief.  STEVE does not
     register the CENOBITES' presence however.

                             KIRSTY
                Steve.  Thank God you came.

                             STEVE
                What happened to you?

     He steps between the CENOBITES.

                             KIRSTY
                These THINGS ... they want to
                take me -

                             STEVE
                What things?

                             CENOBITE
                       (to Kirsty)
                He doesn't see us, or hear us.
                We belong to you, Kirsty.  And
                you to us.

                             KIRSTY
                No!

                             STEVE
                What's wrong?

                             KIRSTY
                Don't let them take me, Steve -

                             STEVE
                I won't let anybody take you.

     He starts to walk towards her, but the creature in the
     dark glasses takes a hooked rod from its back and puts
     the hook to STEVE's neck.   STEVE's hand moves to the
     place; he makes a small sound of pain. The CENOBITE
     takes off its glasses, to see its trick better.  The eyes
     beneath are sewn shut.  It pulls a little more on the hook.
     STEVE winces.

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                If he takes another step, we
                open his throat.

                             KIRSTY
                       (to Steve)
                Please go, Steve.

                             STEVE
                What?

                             KIRSTY
                Just go.  PLEASE.  I'll be O.K.
                I'm going to go see Dad.  He'll
                look after me -

                             STEVE
                       (protesting)
                What did I say?

                             KIRSTY
                Will you GO, damn you?

     Mystified, STEVE retreats a step.

                             STEVE
                I'll come back later, huh?

                             KIRSTY
                Sure.  Why not?

     Still puzzled, STEVE crosses to the door.

                             STEVE
                'Bye.

                             KIRSTY
                'Bye.

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                Good.

                             CENOBITE
                It's time we were away.

                             KIRSTY
                       (almost crying)
                Let me alone, will you?

                             CENOBITE
                No tears please.  It's a waste
                of good suffering.

     The chatterer comes for her.  As it does so desperation
     brings a plan to KIRSTY's head.

                             KIRSTY
                Wait!

     He stops.

                             CENOBITE
                No time for argument.

                             KIRSTY
                You did this before, right?

                             CENOBITE
                Many times.

                             KIRSTY
                To a man called Frank Cotton?

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                Oh yes.

                             KIRSTY
                But he escaped you.

                             CENOBITE
                Nobody escapes us.

                             KIRSTY
                HE did.  I've seen him.  He's
                alive.

                             CENOBITE
                Is that so?   And what are you
                proposing?

                             KIRSTY
                I'll take you to him.  Then you
                take him instead of me.  Back
                wherever you come from.

     The CENOBITE stares at her unblinking.

                             CENOBITE
                Perhaps ...

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                But if you cheat us ...

     The sound of THE ENGINEER, scratching on the other side
     of the wall.  The plaster cracks, violently.

                             CENOBITE
                We'll tear your soul apart!

     We cut back to the cracking plaster, which cracks further.
     We hear STEVE's voice, and pan back into the room.

     The door opens.   KIRSTY and the CENOBITES have gone.

     STEVE is there, with the NURSE.

                             STEVE
                She was trembling all over.

                             NURSE
                I'd better go look for her.

     The NURSE heads for the door.

                             STEVE
                Maybe she's gone back to her -

     He looks round. The NURSE has gone.

                             STEVE
                - father.

     His eyes have alighted on the box, which is lying on
     the bed.

     He picks it up.


151  EXT.   NUMBER 55   NIGHT

     Lights burn in the house, upstairs and down.


152  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

     JULIA sits in front of the dressing table mirror.
     She has a glass of whisky in front of her.  She sips
     from it, studying her face in the mirror.  We've seen
     her in many moods through the story:  now we see a
     mingling of fear and exhilaration on her face.  She gets
     up.  Laid out on the bed is,of all things, her wedding
     gown.


153  INT.   STEVE'S CAR   NIGHT

     STEVE drives towards Lodovico Street, scanning the streets
     for sign of KIRSTY.


154  EXT.   STREET   NIGHT

     As his car drives past, KIRSTY turns a corner.  He does
     not see her.   KIRSTY hurries along the street.  The
     wind is chilly.   Sometimes she hears a bell in it.


155  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT

     STEVE drives up to the house.  The lights are still
     burning.  He gets out of the car, and hurries down the
     path.


156  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT

     He knocks on the door.  There's no reply.


157  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

     Two shadowy, naked figures stand face to face in the
     bedroom.  We can see no detail of their features.  We
     move down their bodies.  They are standing in a shining
     pool of blood.


158  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT

     STEVE starts round the back of the house.


159  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

     The male of the couple pads towards  the bedroom door,
     leaving a trail of blood behind him.  We can still see
     very little of the man.


160  EXT.   LODOVICO STREET   NIGHT

     KIRSTY turns the corner of the street, and starts down
     it.  The wind is strong now.  It is full of sibilant
     whispers, hurrying her along.


161  INT.   BEDROOM   NIGHT

     JULIA dresses.


162  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT

     KIRSTY reaches the doorstep.  As she does so the whispers
     die away completely.   She beats on the door.   No reply.
     She beats again, more urgently.

                             KIRSTY
                Please!   Dad!   It's me!
                It's Kirsty!


163  INT.   LANDING   NIGHT

     JULIA steps onto the landing.  We can hear KIRSTY shouting
     on the step.

                             JULIA
                Damn her.

     We hear a voice, off-screen.  Is it FRANK or LARRY?
     Impossible to be sure.

                             VOICE
                Answer it.


164  EXT.   DOORSTEP   NIGHT

     KIRSTY still beats on the door.

                             KIRSTY
                Please, answer me!  Please -

     The door is suddenly opened.  JULIA is standing there.

                             JULIA
                Kirsty?   It's very late.

                             KIRSTY
                Where's Daddy?

                             JULIA
                What's the problem?

                             KIRSTY
                       (stepping inside)
                I have to see my father.

                             JULIA
                Of course.  There's no need to
                shout.


165  INT.   DINING ROOM   NIGHT

     We pan across the table.  At the end of the table sits
     LARRY.  The light is behind him.  His features are
     shadowy.  But we can see that he is badly bruised.

     We hear the womens' voices, off-screen.

                             JULIA
                You look terrible.  Have you had
                an accident?

                             KIRSTY
                I was here this afternoon.

                             JULIA
                This afternoon.

                             KIRSTY
                I saw everything.

                             JULIA
                I'm sorry, I don't follow.
                What was there to see?

     KIRSTY doesn't answer, but walks through into the Dining
     Room.  KIRSTY sees LARRY at the table.

                             KIRSTY
                Oh God.  Thank God.
                       (she starts to sob)
                I thought something might have ...

     She glances round at JULIA, who has also entered.
                       (to Larry)
                I have to talk to you.

                             LARRY
                Of course.

     LARRY leans forward, and into the pool of light over
     the table.  He looks much the worse for wear.  His
     flesh is raw and bruised.  There is blood at his neck
     and hairline.

                             LARRY
                It's all right, sweetheart.
                Julia's told me everything;
                and it's all right ...

                             KIRSTY
                No.  You don't understand. Your
                brother - Frank - he's here in
                the house.  And he's -

                             LARRY
                Whatever Frank did was his error.
                And it's finished with now.

                             KIRSTY
                Finished?

                             LARRY
                       (smiles)
                He's gone.

                             KIRSTY
                Gone?

                             JULIA
                Dead.

                             LARRY
                He was insane, baby:  a mad dog.
                I put him out of his misery -

     KIRSTY stares at LARRY, while in her head she hears the
     CENOBITE's voice.

                             CENOBITE
                ... we'll tear your soul apart ...

                             LARRY
                I'll go to the police, when I'm
                feeling stronger.  Try and find
                some way to make them understand,
                though God knows I don't really
                understand myself.  Did he hurt
                you?

     KIRSTY is dumb with horror at her situation.

                             LARRY
                       (leans back)
                Poor Frank.  He's better off
                dead.

                             KIRSTY
                I don't believe it.

                             LARRY
                I'm afraid it's true.

                             KIRSTY
                       (tears in her eyes)
                I want to see.

                             LARRY
                No you don't.

                             KIRSTY
                Yes!

                             LARRY
                       (to Julia)
                Show her.

     KIRSTY turns away from LARRY.  JULIA leads her out into
     the Hallway.

                                            CUT TO

     LARRY, still sitting at the table.  His fingers drum a
     familiar tattoo.   Beneath his breath, he hums 'Colonel
     Bogey'.


166  INT.   UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

     JULIA pushes open the door of the Torture Room.  It
     creaks wide.  Lying on the floor inthe middle of the
     room is a skinned corpse, in a tangle of torn clothing.
     It steams.  There is blood everywhere.  That too, steams.

     KIRSTY is revolted.  She steps away from the door, back
     down the landing.

     The bell has begun to ring again, distantly, and there
     is the sound of wings in the air - thousands of birds -
     beating on the other side of the wall.

     KIRSTY starts down the stairs again.

                             JULIA
                Where are you going?

     KIRSTY doesn't reply.  She merely hurries away.

                             JULIA
                       (calling after
                        her)
                You leave this to us, you
                hear me?   We'll deal with
                the police -


167  INT.   HALLWAY   NIGHT

     KIRSTY descends the stairs.  LARRY has stepped out of
     the Dining Room and is moving to intercept her as she
     makes her way to the front door.

     The sound of wings, and bells - and a terrible slow
     thunder which underpins it all - mounts in volume.

     LARRY snatches at her arm.

                             LARRY
                Where are you going?

                             KIRSTY
                I have to get out.

     She shrugs off his arm.   The thunder is increasing.

                             LARRY
                Stay with me -

     JULIA is on the stairs, watching this exchange.

                             LARRY
                - it's all right.   Really it
                is ...

     He touches her face, fondly.
                             KIRSTY
                I can't stay.

     She goes to the door.

                             LARRY
                Come to Daddy.

     She hesitates at the door, and turns.


168  INT.  HALLWAY   NIGHT   (KIRSTY'S P.O.V.)

     The thunder fills KIRSTY's head, as she stares at LARRY,
     who has opened his arms to her.

                             LARRY
                Come to Daddy.

     Her gaze moves up to JULIA, who is on the stairs.

                             JULIA
                No, damn you -


169  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT

                             KIRSTY
                       (mouths)
                Oh my God.

     Everything is slowing down.  The bells and the thunder
     fill the soundtrack.

     LARRY smiles, as KIRSTY moves towards him.  Tears have
     begun to fill her eyes.   She searches for him.  His
     smile decays as he realizes her objective.   Her nails
     rake his cheek.   The flesh puckers, and tears along the
     brow.   Blood flows.   The mask of stolen flesh he wears
     slips a little, and FRANK's twisted features come into
     view.

                             JULIA
                Frank!

     KIRSTY screams, as FRANK lunges for her.  The lights in
     the hallway flicker, and threaten to go out.

     KIRSTY avoids FRANK's blow, but in doing so allows him
     to get between her and the front door.  She's trapped.
     His torn face flapping, he opens his jacket (the interior
     of which is blood-stained) and pulls a knife from the
     lining.

     Suddenly, JULIA is behind her, gripping hold of her hair.

     FRANK advances on KIRSTY, but in the last moment before
     the fatal stab KIRSTY twists, avoiding the blow.  JULIA
     shrieks and stumbles forward, the knife gleaming as
     it's buried to the hilt in her side.

     KIRSTY slips from between them.  JULIA collapses into
     FRANK's arms.   He holds her up.

     KIRSTY makes a dive for the front door, but FRANK lets
     JULIA slip and intercepts KIRSTY.  JULIA falls back
     against the wall, dying.  KIRSTY retreats to the bottom
     of the stairs.  FRANK follows.

                             FRANK
                You're not leaving now -

     As he follows, JULIA reaches out and takes hold of his
     sleeve.

     KIRSTY flees the only route she can, upstairs.  The
     house is creaking in every board and rafter now.

     FRANK turns on JULIA, trapping her against the wall.,

                             JULIA
                Help me, Frank. For God's
                sake.

     He puts his hands around her neck, and leans towards
     her.  At the last moment she seems to understand that
     he intends not to kiss her but to steal what little
     life she has left.

                             JULIA
                No, Frank -

     From the stairs KIRSTY glimpses him battering upon
     her.

     Then she looks away, and runs up the stairs.

     When we look back JULIA is withering in FRANK's arms.


170  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT

     The landing is smoky.  The lights have taken on a
     yellowish tinge.  The air is full of moans.

     KIRSTY is desperate for a hiding place.   She tries one
     of the doors, but it's locked.   She opens another, and
     the din of birds' wings gets louder.


171  INT.  BIRD ROOM    NIGHT

     A P.O.V. shot, lunging towards KIRSTY in the doorway.
     She slams the door in the face of whatever's coming
     for her.


172  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT

     FRANK hears the door slam.   He drops JULIA to the
     ground.  She's dead, her flesh rotting on her face.

     FRANK starts to climb the stairs, his eyes burning
     with hunger.


173  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT

     KIRSTY is cornered.   From below, FRANK's voice.

                             FRANK
                Where are you, beautiful?

     KIRSTY starts up the second flight of stairs, as FRANK's
     shadow is thrown up on the wall below.


174  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT

     KIRSTY is faced with a choice.  The Torture Room door
     is open, but the skinned body is in there, so instead
     she heads for the Junk Room, and opens the door.


175  INT.  JUNK ROOM    NIGHT

     Moonlight falls through the window, illuminating a
     chaos of furniture and boxes.  She crosses to the window,
     and tries to get it open.   It won't budge.

                             FRANK
                       (somewhere below)
                Where are you, honey?

     She looks around for a lever to open the window with -


176  INT.  LOWER LANDING    NIGHT

     FRANK reaches the landing and opens the bedroom door,
     calling for her. Then he starts up the last flight of
     stairs.

                             FRANK
                Come to Daddy.


177  INT.  JUNK ROOM   NIGHT

     KIRSTY lifts a cloth off one of the boxes.

     Staring up from the box is the corpse of PRUDHOE, his
     eyes and mouth open in a silent shriek.

     She reels back from the box, terrified, backing into the
     shadows.

     An arm reaches for her, taking hold of her and dragging
     her back into darkness as the door opens.  FRANK stands
     on the theshold.   His breath is thick.  He shambles
     forward, but he doesn't see her.

     We CUT back to the shadows.  KIRSTY's eyes are wild
     with terror.

     Back to the door, which clicks closed.

     KIRSTY breaks cover, and so does her saviour.  It's
     STEVE.  He is sweating with terror.

                             KIRSTY
                       (a whisper)
                What are you doing here?

                             STEVE
                Got in downstairs.  Looking
                for you.  What's going on?

     She shakes her head.   STEVE brings the box from his
     jacket.

                             STEVE
                You forgot something -

     She doesn't see what he's produced.  She's already
     moving to the door.  She listens.


178  INT.  UPPER LANDING   NIGHT

     The landing is empty.   The door of the Junk Room opens.

     KIRSTY steps out.

     The house is strangely still.  The lights swing a little;
     but otherwise ... nothing.  She advances along the
     passageway.  STEVE follows.  They reach the top of the
     stairs in safety.

                             STEVE
                       (signalled more than
                       spoken)
                I'll go first -

     As he speaks, FRANK steps out of the Torture Room,
     knife in hand.

     Roaring, he comes at them both.  KIRSTY flings herself
     out of the path of the knife.  FRANK swipes at STEVE,
     who falls backwards down the stairs.   He cries out,
     head hitting the stairs as he descends.

     The box falls from his unconscious hand.

     FRANK turns on KIRSTY, who avoids one slice of the knife,
     and another, but is driven back into the Torture Room.


179  INT.  TORTURE ROOM    NIGHT

     He's after her in a flash.

     She falls beside her father's body, her eyes meeting
     its skinned face.

                             KIRSTY
                God -

                             FRANK
                Don't cry for him.  He's dead.
                He always was.

     KIRSTY has been pushed to the limits of her endurance.
     She can be terrorized and pursued no longer.  Death
     looks an easy option by comparison with more of FRANK's
     horrors.

                             KIRSTY
                Go on.   Kill me.  I don't care.

                             FRANK
                Poor baby.

                             KIRSTY
                You bastard

                             FRANK
                Hush now.   It's all right.
                Frank's here.

                             KIRSTY
                Frank.

                             FRANK
                That's right.  Are you losing
                your mind, baby?  This is Frank
                you're talking to.  FRANK.

     As he speaks the bell begins tolling again.  FRANK looks
     puzzled.

                             FRANK
                What's going on?

     Light begins to pour through the walls of the room.

                No.

     He starts towards the door.  But he's too late.  The
     CENOBITES are standing in his way.  He backs off from
     them.

                             CENOBITE
                Frank -

                             KIRSTY
                       (to Cenobite)
                What took you so long?

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                We had to hear it from his own
                lips -

     FRANK turns on KIRSTY.

                             FRANK
                You set me up!   You bitch.
                You set me up!

     The pattern of light in the room has become more elaborate,
     and the CENOBITES move through it towards FRANK.

                             CENOBITE
                       (to Kirsty)
                This isn't for your eyes.

     KIRSTY crosses towards the door.  As she reaches for the
     handle she hears FRANK roar behind her.  She turns.   He
     breaks between the CENOBITES, knife in hand, but as he
     comes within striking distance the air is full of whining
     sounds and he stops dead.

     They have their hooks in him, we see.  In his arms and
     legs;  in his back and sides;  in his scalp and neck and
     temples.   Hooks attached to countless chains, which
     arrest his progress.  They plough through his flesh as
     he strives to reach her.  But at a gesture from the leader
     of the CENOBITES, the chains are hauled in.  He flings
     back his head, yelling.   The knife drops from his hand.

                             CENOBITE
                       (to Kirsty)
                Out!

     She turns back to the door and opens it.  FRANK is hauled
     back towards the centre of the room.

                             FRANK
                Bitch!

     The house is growling  from basement to eaves now, as
     KIRSTY steps onto the landing.


180  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT

     Behind her, FRANK howls.

     She looks back.

     They have him IN EXTREMIS,    his body spread-eagled;
     hooks in a hundred places, pulling at his flesh.  He
     fights like a wild animal, snarling and cursing.  They
     pull the chains tighter.


181  INT.  TORTURE ROOM    NIGHT

     A close up of FRANK's face.   He suddenly stops fighting.
     He raises his head, his eyes staring up at KIRSTY from
     beneath a bleeding, sweating brow.  He flicks his
     tongue over his bloodied lips.

     Then -

     - he comes apart.


182  INT.  UPPER LANDING    NIGHT

     The door slams as FRANK's body is torn apart in a welter
     of blood and flesh fragments.

     Something heavy thuds against the door.

     KIRSTY turns and starts down the stairs.


183  INT.  STAIRS    NIGHT

     As she reaches the place where STEVE is half-sitting, half-
     lying, the house starts to growl as though its foundations
     are about to give way.  STEVE's nose is bleeding, and
     his face is bruised, but he's conscious.

                             KIRSTY
                We have to get out of here.
                They'll kill us for the fun of
                it.

     STEVE staggers to his feet.   KIRSTY picks up the box,
     which is on the lower landing. As she picks it up,
     the FEMALE CENOBITE steps from the shadows.

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                Don't leave us yet -

     KIRSTY starts to try and manipulate the box in her hands.

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                We've got such sights to show
                you -

     KIRSTY manages to slot one of the pieces of the box back
     into place.

                             FEMALE CENOBITE
                ... don't ...

     Her voice becomes a howl, and she's sucked away into
     darkness.

                             STEVE
                       (behind Kirsty)
                Jesus Christ.

     They start down to the half-landing.  There stands the
     CENOBITE in the dark-glasses, carrying the hooked rod
     he threatened STEVE with in the hospital.  Again,
     KIRSTY manipulates the box.  Again, the CENOBITE howls
     and is claimed by the darkness.


184  INT.  HALLWAY    NIGHT

     They hurry down to the hallway, half expecting another
     creature to step into their path.  Dust is falling from
     the ceiling, and there are cracks opening up  in the
     walls.  Any moment, surely, the whole place will be
     destroyed.

     JULIA's body has gone from the hallway;  a trail of blood
     leads into the dining room.

     As KIRSTY and STEVE stumble across the hallway, they hear
     JULIA's voice, off-screen, an eerie, ghostly voice.

                             JULIA
                Kirsty ...

     KIRSTY hesitates, and looks towards the door of the
     dining room.

     There stands the bride, her white dress soaked in blood,
     her veil covering her face.

                             KIRSTY
                Julia?

     KIRSTY takes a step towards her, but as she does so the
     veil rises of its own accord, and the chattering CENOBITE
     is beneath.

     KIRSTY slams the box closed.

     The CENOBITE howls, and disappears.

     STEVE heads for the door.  Turns the handle.

     As he does so, KIRSTY realizes there's one piece of the
     box unfinished.

                             KIRSTY
                Don't!

     Too late.  He turns the handle.   The door is flung
     open, and THE ENGINEER, clinging to the sides of the
     door, swings down into the hallway.

     STEVE is flung backwards against KIRSTY.    The box
     falls from KIRSTY's hand.  The beast moves to bite at
     STEVE, who scrambles out of the way, leaving KIRSTY
     in the front line.

     The box lies between KIRSTY and THE ENGINEER, which now
     uses its forelegs to crawl over the hallway towards her,
     its legs still bracing it in the door.

     She snatches for the box.  THE ENGINEER, its mouth
     oozing fluids, almost catches her arm.

     Again, she tries.   This time one of its arms seizes hold
     of KIRSTY and drags her towards its jaws.

     Behind KIRSTY, STEVE snatches up a piece of plaster and
     flings it in THE ENGINEER's face.  It momentarily
     relaxes its grip on KIRSTY, who slides her hand from its
     hold and claims the box.  She now has slime on her fingers.
     The box defies her manipulations.

                             STEVE
                Come on!   Come on!

     THE ENGINEER crawls towards them.  Up above, the din
     of the roof collapsing.  Timbers and dust hurtle down
     the stairs.

                             KIRSTY
                Shit.  Shit.  Shit.

     THE ENGINEER is almost upon her.  It rears up, its saliva
     dropping on her.

     And then, miraculously, the last piece of the box slots into
     place.
 
     The same vortex that seized the other CENOBITE seizes
     THE ENGINEER.   Howling its complaint, it is drawn out
     into the darkness beyond the door, and disappears.

     Its voice grows thin, and fades.

     Finally, silence.

     The house is still.

     KIRSTY gets to her feet.  STEVE does the same.

     Together, they move to the door, and out onto the
     step.


185  EXT.  DOORSTEP   NIGHT

     The door slams behind them, of its own accord.

     KIRSTY turns the sealed box over in her hand.

     There is a slit in it which has not quite closed.  Light
     suddenly pours from it, up into KIRSTY's face.  Her
     features are momentarily distorted, as if sucked towards
     the box.  From within:  shrieks, bells, music.

     Between the screams, FRANK's voice.

                             FRANK
                Come to Daddy!

     She slams the panel shut.  The distortions cease. So
     does the din.

                             KIRSTY
                       (quietly)
                Not tonight.

     A smile crosses her face, and she leaves the doorstep,
     making her way towards the street.  STEVE gazes at her,
     then follows.

     Their figures are erased by the darkness.

     Somewhere, a bell rings as ...

          EXT.   DERELICT STREET   TWILIGHT
          
          Night is falling in a forgotten part of the city.
          
          The street-lights are a joke - three out of four are dead.
          Only a large moon and some cloud-streaked stars illuminate this
          dark and derelict street.
          
          Once the hub of an industrial area, now the buildings are
          abandoned, the sidewalks choked with litter and debris.  Stores
          are boarded-up, windows are glassless, walls are graffitied.
          
          At various points, several BUMS warm their hands at trash-can
          fires.
          
          ANGLE ON TWO BUMS
          
           - as their eyes move, following something moving down the
          street.  Heard OFF is the sound of a smooth and powerful
          engine.
          
          ANGLE ON STREET
          
          Down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an
          incongruously expensive car - a Range Rover. A rich kid is
          going shopping.
          
          The car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only
          open store on the block.
          
          ANGLE ON STORE
          
          A dim light bulb shines within - the only indicator that the
          store is still trading.  Its windows are grimy, its door
          defaced.  Above the door - barely legible through the accrued
          dirt of city years - a sign; CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES AND CURIOS.
          
          ANGLE ON CAR
          
          The side door opens - helped on its way by the kick of an
          expensive leather boot - and JP MONROE steps out.
          
          JP is 24, rich, handsome, and spoiled. His hair is slick with
          designer-grease, his slim frame is wrapped in a $600 leather
          jacket.
          
          For a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous
          glances up and down the ruined street.  He shows no anxiety at
          being in this twilight part of town.  Cocooned in the
          confidence of wealth, he's never felt threatened in his life.
          Satisfied he's in the right place, he walks confidently through
          the doorway.
          
          
          
                                                                      2
          
          INT.   CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES   NIGHT
          
          The store itself looks like an antique - old wood panelling and
          shelving, Victorian display cases, and faded wallpaper.  It is
          grimy, dusty, and dimly-lit - and apparently unattended.
          
          It is packed with merchandise - shelves and aisles overflow
          onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through.
          
          The stock is a strange surreal mix.  Discarded items from 50's
          America (Norge fridges, toasters, Frankie Lymon albums) share
          space with older items; framed pictures, Victorian automata,
          wax dolls, and (a specialty of the store?) items of punishment;
          stocks, iron boots, chastity belts, whips. Could that really
          be an Electric Chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room?
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
          He wanders through the merchandise, casting appraising glances
          at some items.  Some he even runs his hands over - grimacing at
          the dust and grime they leave on his fingers.  But his manner
          suggests he is looking for something specific.
          
          Near the room's center is an old hoarding from the dead days of
          vaudeville and travelling shows.  It is tall and broad and is
          leaning against something behind it.
          
          ANGLE ON HOARDING
          
           - which is colorfully and garishly decorated and full of
          hyperbolic come-ons to long-dead punters:
          
          YOU WILL BE AMAZED! THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE! FREAKS OF NATURE!
          AN EDUCATIONAL SHOW FOR ALL THE FAMILY PRESENTED UNDER THE
          AUSPICES OF PROFESSOR EMMANUEL BOCKLIN, TRAGEDIAN AND
          MENAGERIST.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
           - as he moves the hoarding aside.
          
                                     JP
                        Wow ...
          
          REVEALED is a six-foot tall black rectangular pillar, covered
          in beautifully detailed 3-D carvings all in the same matt-black
          finish as the pillar itself.  The pillar is extremely bizarre,
          as if a New York avant-garde sculptor has interpreted a Totem
          Pole for jaded modern tastes.  The carvings are of dead rats,
          copulating skeletons,  filigree-patterned boxes, and faces.
          
          One of these faces - recognizable to the audience but not to JP
          - is the ossified visage of PINHEAD, the demon from the first
          two HELLRAISER pictures.
          
                                                                      3
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
           - as he leans in to study this face, already fascinated by its
          calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom.
          
          A voice OFF startles him.
          
                                     BUM
                        You want it?
          
          JP whirls round in shock.  A BUM is standing close to him.
          
          ANGLE ON BUM
          
          He has long matted black hair and a similarly greasy beard.
          His eyes are a piercing, excited blue.  Otherwise he is
          indistinguishable from those we saw on the street outside 
          ragged, tatty clothes, features blackened with grime.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
           - as he glances round the store and past the bum to the door
          beyond; has this character just wandered in from the street?
          
                                     JP
                        Is it yours?
          
          ANGLE ON BOTH
          
          The Bum smiles, shaking his head knowingly.
          
                                     BUM
                        No.  Not mine.  Yours.
          
          JP nods, still a little uncertain.
          
                                     JP
                        How much do you want for it?
          
                                     BUM
                        Whatever you think its worth.
          
          JP digs a hand into his back pocket and pulls out a wad of
          cash.  Without counting or checking, he proffers it.
          
          The Bum's hand flies out and siezes JP's, pressing the money
          between their palms, making the exchange into a handclasp.
          
          In the background, OUT OF FOCUS, is Pinhead's face on the
          pillar.
          
                                     BUM (OFF)
                        Enjoy ...
          
          
                                                                      4
          
          The FOCUS switches so that the hands in foreground BLUR and
          Pinhead's frozen face becomes SHARP, as if he is silently
          watching this deal take place.
          
          The Bum's hand moves away with the money as we
          
          FADE TO BLACK
          
          
          INT.   HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM   NIGHT
          
          BLACKNESS.   Voice OVER.
          
                                     JOEY
                        It's a mystery to me ...
          
          SMASH-CUT to full-frame VIDEO IMAGE image of JOANNE
          SUMMERSKILL, standing and looking directly into camera, as if
          we are watching a TV broadcast.  In shot behind her is a quiet
          hospital Emergency Room - no patients, no staff, just beds and
          intensive-care equipment.
          
          Joanne - or JOEY, as she prefers to be called - is 23 years
          old, an attractive and clever brunette, with a quiet sadness in
          her eyes that she usually manages to keep almost hidden.
          
          Dressed in the stylish but sedate garb of a TV newsperson, she
          holds a microphone marked with the logo of her station, W-QQY.
          
          Her direct address to the unseen TV camera continues.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Most nights this inner-city Emergency
                        Room would be a chaos of blood and panic
                        and grace under pressure.  But tonight,
                        as you see, it's like Death took a
                        holiday.  It's a mystery to me ... A
                        mystery how those assholes at
                        Assignments knew it.  This is Joey
                        Summerskill for W-QQY.  Emergency Room.
                        No story.  Really, really pissed off.
          
          Despite the nature of her last few words, Joey has ironically
          kept up the manner and delivery of a newscaster.  Now, she
          breaks mood, looks away from the camera, and, with a dismissive
          wave of the hand, begins to walk out of shot.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Ah, break it down, Doc.  It's a bust.
          
          CUT TO WIDE
          
           - to reveal that we are not watching a broadcast at all but
          are in the ER in real time.  As well as Joey, the room contains
          her cameraman ("DOC" FISHER) and an ER NURSE.
                                                                      5
          
          Doc - a 45 year old with a weight problem, a nicotine
          addiction, and a cynical attitude - lowers a shoulder-mounted
          Video camera and watches Joey walk to a water-cooler against a
          wall. His expression is a mix of exasperation and sympathy.
          
          The Nurse is a middle-aged woman of Asian ancestry.  She has a
          puzzled expression as she addresses Doc.
          
                                     NURSE
                        She can talk like this on television?
                        She can say this thing?  This assholes?
          
          Doc replies but keeps his eyes on Joey as he crosses to her.
          
                                     DOC
                        No sweat, sweetheart.  It's for the
                        European satellite ....  Joey; rein it
                        in, kid.  They couldn't've known.
          
          Joey sucks angrily at water from a paper-cup and then crushes
          and bins the cup like an act of revenge.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I know.  I know.  But it's just so ...
                        neat, isn't it?  The first gig that
                        isn't cute kids or diet gurus and it's
                        taken away from me.
          
                                     DOC
                        Yeah, well like you said - it's a
                        mystery.  But that's all it is.
                        Mystery.  Not malice.  What, you think
                        the station paid off every accident
                        victim in the city to ... ?
          
          Doc is interrupted by the RINGING of a cell-phone he has
          holstered at his waist.  He picks it up.

          The line goes dead.  Doc looks at Joey.  She heard it all.  He
          shrugs apologetically.
          
                                                                      6

          With a rueful smile, Joey watches Doc leave.
          
          Joey and the Nurse exchange glances - Joey's impassive but
          vaguely friendly, the Nurse's a little disapproving; if the
          camera's gone, what the hell are YOU still doing here?
          
          
          INT.   HOSPITAL CORRIDOR   NIGHT
          
          Joey makes her solitary way along a medium-length corridor
          that has two sets of double swing doors at either end, one set
          giving on to the ER, the other toward an exit.  Joey is heading
          for the latter, her mood sad and defeated.
          
          ANGLE ON EXIT DOORS
          
          Suddenly - SMASH! - the doors burst open from the other side.
          
          ANGLE ON CORRIDOR
          
          The mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled
          rapidly through the doors.
          
          Two PARAMEDICS, both male, both about Joey's age, are pushing
          the gurney at a run and talking rapidly to each other.  They
          completely ignore Joey and also ignore the TEENAGE GIRL who is
          running beside the gurney.
          
          The girl - TERRI - is 18 or 19.  She is a pale-faced blonde
          dressed as if for a Desperately-Seeking-Susan party and is
          keeping up a stream of chatter as if rehearsing excuses.
          
          
          
                                                                      7
          
          As Joey flattens herself against the corridor wall to let them
          pass, it is neither the paramedics nor Terri that get her
          attention.  It is the BOY on the gurney.
          
          ANGLE ON GURNEY/BOY
          
          The teenage boy lies flat on his back semi-conscious, his
          eyelids fluttering, his breathing shallow.
          
          Horribly, shockingly, dangling from his face and body are long,
          heavy chains that drag and rattle along the corridor floor.
          There are at least sixteen of them and they seem firmly buried
          in his skin.
          
          ANGLE ON CORRIDOR
          
          The DIALOGUE as the gurney is rushed to the ER doors is RAPID-
          FIRE and OVERLAPPED, the Paramedics responding only to each
          other and ignoring the two girls comments and questions.
          
                                     TERRI
                        It wasn't my fault.  It wasn't my fault.
          
                                     PARAMEDIC 1
                        10 milligram IV Valium stat.  How the
                        fuck did this happen ... ?!
          
                                     TERRI
                        It was outside.  I wasn't even with him.
          
                                     PARAMEDIC 2
                        You ever see anything like this before?
          
                                     TERRI
                        He must have stolen it.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What's going on?
          
                                     PARAMEDIC 1
                        Yeah, sure.  Five times a fucking day.
                        Just push!
          
          Once the gurney has passed her, Joey runs along behind it.
          
                                     TERRI
                        It was off the statue.  In the club.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What happened to him?
          
                                     PARAMEDIC 2
                        Think they'll get him back?
          
          
                                                                      8
          
                                     TERRI
                        It's nothing to do with me.
          
                                      PARAMEDIC 1
                        Worst case of status I've seen.  Even
                        money at best.
          
          The foot of the gurney slams into the ER doors and the
          Paramedics slide it rapidly through.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Wait!  I'm a reporter!  Tell me where he
                        was ...
          
          ANGLE ON ER THROUGH DOORS
          
          The Nurse and a middle-aged DOCTOR are seen through the doors
          preparing emergency equipment.  The Doctor already has
          fibrillator pads in his hands.
          
          The Paramedics follow the gurney through and, turning rapidly,
          push the doors closed from the inside.
          
          ANGLE ON CORRIDOR
          
          Joey and Terri are alone, excluded from the ER activity. Joey
          turns to speak but Terri is already halfway to the other doors.
          
          Joey runs after her.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need
                        talk to you.
          
                                     TERRI
                               (over her shoulder)
                        It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't
                        even with him.
          
          Joey catches up with her a couple of yards short of the doors.
          She grabs at her arm to slow her down.
          
          Terri turns, snatching her arm away in a sudden moment of fierce
          anger.  She backs toward the doors, making gestures of
          dismissal and denial with her hands.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my
                        problem!  I was just there!
          
                                     JOEY
                        Where?
          
          
          
                                                                      9
          
                                     TERRI
                        Under The Underground.  Can I like GO
                        now?!
          
                                     JOEY
                        Under the Underground?  What's that?
                        Where is ...
          
          Suddenly, the conversation is interrupted by a shatteringly
          loud SCREAM, agonized and terrified, coming from the ER.
          
          Both girls freeze but then their reactions are very different:
          Joey turns instantly and runs back toward the ER.  Terri
          watches her for a beat and then heads through the other doors.
          
          The SCREAM continues, a howling horrible sound.
          
          Joey reaches the ER doors and throws them open.  And freezes in
          terrified shock.
          
          
          INT.  EMERGENCY ROOM   NIGHT
          
          THE DOCTOR
          
           - is on the floor, as if flung there by some powerful force.
          The fibrillator pads are still in his hands and his expression
          is awe-struck and disbelieving.
          
          THE NURSE
          
           - is cowering behind a mobile tray of surgical instruments,
          muttering to herself and making the gesture of the cross.
          
          THE TWO PARAMEDICS
          
           - are flattened against the far wall, terror on their faces.
          
          ANGLE ON TABLE
          
          The Boy is on the emergency table.  It's him that's screaming.
          His body is arched tight in shock, eyes and mouth wide open.
          
          He's wired up to an ECG and the MONITOR shows a heartbeat that
          should be measured on the Richter scale.
          
          The chains - all still connected to his face and his body  are
          rigid and tight, being pulled straight up into the air as if
          tugged taut by invisible hands.
          
          The boy's skin is stretched and pulled at those points where
          the chains are connected to him and it seems horribly possible
          that his flesh will burst if the pressure continues.
          
          
                                                                      10
          
          The scene is held for a terrible frozen moment.  Then suddenly
          the chains drop, the scream stops, and the boy's body slumps.
          
          There is a massive ELECTRICAL SURGE.  The ECG flat-lines before
          it and the other monitors go haywire, sparking and spluttering.
          
          CUT TO WIDE
          
          The lights in the room flicker and strobe.
          
          The fibrillator pads arc angrily. The Doctor flings them away.
          
          ELECTRIC ENERGY seems to run along the slumped chains and they
          disappear as if dissolved in some impossible electric meltdown.
          
          Lighting and machinery return to normal (ECG still flat-lining)
          and the medical staff stare thunder-struck at the dead boy.
          
          For the first time, the other people in the ER become aware of
          Joey's presence in the doorway.
          
                                     DOCTOR
                        Who's that?  Get her out of here!
          
          The Nurse heads for the doors.  Joey is already backing away.
          
          ANGLE THROUGH DOORS INTO CORRIDOR
          
           - as Joey backs away, an expression of numbed shock on her
          face.  The doors close over, blocking her out.
          
          ANGLE ON FIBRILLATOR PADS
          
           - still arcing.
          
          CROSS-FADE TO
          
          
          INT.   CROSS-TOWN BUS    NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on flickering neon light in the bus cabin.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - glancing at the light from her seat.
          
          JOEY'S POV - VARIOUS ANGLES
          
          The bus is almost deserted.  Three other passengers - A PUNK, A
          BAG LADY, and A WINO - are spread out around the interior.  All
          seem lost in worlds of their own but their vacant alienated
          stares highlight Joey's isolation and tension.  Fear has
          entered her life.
          
          
                                                                      11
          
          The bus moves through the neon-lit loneliness of downtown
          streets.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - her face, lit by reflected store-signs and street-lights, is
          lost and distant, as if she is submerged in some dream-sea of
          memory and sadness.
          
          INT.   TV STATION, EDITING SUITE   DAY
          
          A wall of TV monitors, each monitor showing Joey sitting on a
          couch with a painfully thin older woman - BRITTANY VERTUE.
          
          Brittany's probably 50 but her face is as tight and smooth as
          surgery can make it.  She is dressed in the standard uniform of
          the health-avatar; brightly-colored leotard over black tights.
          
          Joey has a big paperback book - BEYOND HUNGER; THE BRITTANY
          VERTUE GUIDE TO HOLISTIC DIETING - which she holds to camera.
          She smiles and, turning to face Brittany, crosses her legs.
          
          The image freezes.  And replays.  Joey crosses her legs again.
          And again.  And again.
          
                                     BRAD
                                    (over)
                        See?  This is what I mean.  Your
                        technique is all wrong.
          
          CUT TO WIDE
          
          Joey (in real time) is sitting in an easy chair in the editing
          suite looking at the wall of monitors.
          
          BRAD, a techie in his late-twenties, and DOC FISHER are in
          swivel chairs immediately in front of the video console.
          
          All three are drinking coffee.  Doc is smoking a cigarette.
          
                                     JOEY
                                  (guardedly)
                        What do you mean?
          
                                     BRAD
                        I mean hardly any thigh.  I'm telling
                        you, Joey; shorter skirt, more lift on
                        the leg-cross ... and you're made.
          
          Doc chuckles in a half-friendly, half-sleazy way.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Fuck you.
          
          
                                                                      12 
          
                                     BRAD
                        What, you think I'm kidding?  I
                        guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys
                        upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an
                        anchor-woman.
          
                                     JOEY
                                 (to herself)
                        Jesus Christ ...
          
                                     DOC
                        Ah, give her a break.
          
          Doc leans over and stops the tape.
          
                                     BRAD
                                   (to Doc)
                        What's with you?
          
          He swivels his chair round to face Joey.
          
                                     BRAD
                        C'mon, Joey.  I'm just trying to help
                        you hit a home run here.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It
                        may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I
                        want to do it the right way.  Not tight
                        skirts.  Tight stories.
          
                                     BRAD
                        Right.  Like last night's doozie.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I know what I saw.
          
                                     BRAD
                        And I believe what you say.  But this is
                        TV.  No pictures, no story.
          
                                     DOC
                        Yeah, too bad I had to go and ...
          
                                     BRAD
                        ... and cover something on Planet Earth.
                        See, you gotta remember, Joey; this is a
                        LOCAL station.  As in local to this
                        galaxy.
          
          Joey slams her coffee mug down and stands up.
          
                                     JOEY
                        There's a story out there.
          
                                                                      13
          
                                     BRAD
                               (jumping in warningly)
                        Not on station time.
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My
                        time.
          
          Joey exits.  Brad watches her leave with a half-smile on his
          face then turns to Doc.
          
                                     BRAD
                        Lot of attitude there, Doc ...
          
          He starts up the video tape again and, on the monitors, Joey
          once again crosses her legs on the couch.
          
                                     BRAD
                        ... but great legs.
          
          
          INT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on a screaming male face, twisted as in pain or fury.
          
          PULL BACK rapidly to REVEAL the face belongs to the lead singer
          of THANATOS.  He is on a nightclub stage with the rest of the
          band, all of them dressed in that shit-poor-white-trash-on-dope
          look favored by all such rich young businessmen with guitars.
          
          A tatty banner across the back of the stage proclaims: UNDER
          THE UNDERGROUND PRESENTS THANATOS.
          
          The SCREAM ends, replaced with the roaring thunder of drums and
          guitars as Thanatos kick into some thrash-metal.
          
          The dance-floor of the club is packed with KIDS dancing to the
          incredibly fast, incredibly loud music.
          
          Many of the kids favor the same look as the band but it's not
          exclusive; college types are there too, along with some  male
          and female - sporting the glitz-meets-sleaze look of Terri.
          
          The club itself is of course dimly-lit and the basic decor is
          black.  Where it is distinguished from hundreds of others is in
          the bizarre sculptures and pieces of artwork that hang from the
          ceiling and walls, all in tones of black, silver and gray:
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES ON SCULPTURES
          
          A headless, armless torso wrapped in barbed wire.
          
          A pair of male and female heads.  Bonsai-like trees grow out of
          every orifice - eye-sockets, nostrils, ears, and mouths.
          
                                                                      14
          
          A human arm with the skin and flesh of its upper half peeled
          open and pinned out to reveal inside - instead of bone and
          sinew - an entire miniature metropolis, beautifully detailed.
          
          A black bird cage containing a fetal skeleton.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES ON CLUB
          
          Kids also crowd the bar and the tables on the outskirts of the
          dance floor.  It is a hot, sweaty, faintly aggressive
          atmosphere - people jostling for position, shouting to be
          heard, etc etc.
          
          The camera finds Joey - incongruous by dress and demeanor 
          pushing her way among the crowd.
          
          The music is too loud and overpowering to hear Joey's voice but
          it is clear as she moves through the confines of the club that
          she is approaching various people and enquiring after Terri.
          
          FOUR KIDS AT A TABLE
          
          - shake their heads and shrug.
          
          A PUNK
          
          - stares blankly and blinks.
          
          TWO BIMBOS
          
          - giggle, purse their lips, shake their heads.
          
          JOEY
          
           - catches sight of a blonde figure moving across the dance
          floor and pushes through the crowd to follow.  She taps the
          figure's arm but, as it turns, she realizes it is a man  some
          70's revivalist GLITTER-ROCKER.  He looks quizzically at her.
          
          Joey's mouth moves and this time she seems to get some
          response.  The Glitter-Rocker mouths a name.
          
          Joey can't hear him.  She hands him a business card and a pen.
          
          He scrawls a name on the back of the card and Joey nods her
          thanks as he moves on.
          
          CLOSE ANGLE ON CARD
          
           - as Joey reads the name "Terri" on it.  She flips the card to
          reveal her name and number and writes "Terri - Please call!".
          
          ANGLE ON BAR
          
          
                                                                      15
          
           - as Joey pushes to the counter and hands the card to a BARMAN
          who looks at it, nods, and puts it beneath the counter.
          
          ANGLE ON EXIT
          
           - as Joey makes her way out.
          
          ANGLE ON DANCE FLOOR
          
          Camera moves into the tightly-packed throng on the dance floor,
          making its way slowly toward the previously unseen center.
          
          The crowd parts slightly to reveal, in the direct center of the
          floor, the tall black pillar from the opening sequence.
          
          The pillar is mounted on a plinth and spins as the clientele
          dance around it.  It seems very in keeping with the decor of
          the club but even so it is a strong unsettling presence.
          
          The pillar has been mounted upside down, so that it looks even
          odder than our first glimpse of it.  Near the bottom the
          inverted face of Pinhead, black and frozen, can be seen.
          
          The camera begins to spin around the pillar in contrary motion
          to the pillar's own movement and, as it does so, draws closer
          and closer making for a disorienting, vertiginous image.
          
          As this happens, the raucous sound of the band Thanatos begins
          to fade into a whirl of ECHO and to be replaced by a whirring,
          spinning, sound which we only recognize fully as we
          
          CUT TO
          
          
          EXT.   DENSE JUNGLE   DAY     (JOEY'S DREAM)
          
          The screen is filled with dense jungle foliage.
          
          The chugging spinning sound is now identifiable as the sound of
          Helicopter blades, one element of a SOUND MONTAGE conveying the
          sense and feel of a Jungle War; Helicopters in flight, machine
          gun fire, distant explosions, confused shouts and cries.
          
          A POV camera pushes its way through the lush, humid greenery.
          
          The camera seems to be searching for something, glancing this
          way and that, shoving leaves and tall grass aside.
          
          Voices begin to emerge clearly from the SOUND MASS off-screen
          as if the unseen seeker is getting nearer to his or her goal.
          
                                     SOLDIER 1
                                   (off)
                        Call for a Medi-Vac!
          
                                                                      16
          
                                     SOLDIER 2
                                   (off)
                        Don't die, man!  Don't fucking die!
          
          The dialogue prompts a more furious effort on the part of the
          POV camera.  Pushing frantically through the obscuring foliage,
          it finally gains a clearer view and stops, looking ahead.
          
          In a tiny clearing, ten feet from the camera, still partially
          obscured by the jungle, two camouflage-clad SOLDIERS lean over
          the prone body of a third.  It is unclear due to distance but
          there is a lot of blood on the Soldier's body and uniform.
          
          A new sound joins the SOUND MONTAGE - a persistent, rhythmic,
          ringing sound.  The other elements die away until only this is
          left and we recognize it as the sound of a telephone as we
          
          CUT TO
          
          
          INT.   BEDROOM, JOEY'S APARTMENT   NIGHT
          
          Joey jerks upright in bed as the ringing continues.  Confused
          and disoriented, her eyes fly around her darkened bedroom as if
          she's trying to understand where she is and what is happening.
          
          Finally, she registers the phone and leans toward her bedside
          table to pick it up.
          
          ANGLE ON BEDSIDE TABLE
          
           - favoring the luminous display of an alarm clock next to the
          phone.  Its warm green figures show the time is 2:35.
          
                                     JOEY
                               (off. Sleepily)
                        God.  This better be birth, marriage, or
                        death ...
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - as she picks up the handset and puts it to her ear.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Uh-huh?
          
                                     TERRI
                               (on phone)
                        Uh ... Hi!  Is this ... er ... Joanne
                        Summerskill?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Joey.  Yeah, who is this?
          
          
                                                                      17
          
                                     TERRI
                        You like ... left me a card?  At the
                        club?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Right.  Right!
          
          Joey swings out of bed to sit on the edge, much more alert now.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Right ... So ... Well, what do you want?
          
                                     JOEY
                        I want to talk to you.  We met ... now,
                        listen, don't hang up, OK? ... We met at
                        the hospital last night.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... Look, I'll
                        make a deal with you ... My boyfriend
                        threw me out, right?  I'll trade you.
                        You give me couch-space.  I'll give you
                        talk.  OK?
          
          Joey can't resist another glance at the clock.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
          
                                     TERRI
                               (Surprised at Joey's surprise.
                                Bit of a culture clash here)
                        Of course tonight.  Is that a problem?
                        Like, if you've got a guy there or
                        something ...
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was
                        having bad dreams anyway.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.    NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on the front door of the apartment as it opens to reveal
          Terri leaning against the doorframe.
          
          Clad identically to how we last saw her, Terri clutches a well-
          stuffed leather bag, containing all her worldly possessions.

                        Hi.  How're you doing?
          
          Not waiting for either reply or invitation, she moves forward.
          
          CUT TO WIDE
                                                                      18
          
           - as Terri walks past the dressing-gowned Joey and heads
          straight for Joey's sofa and sprawls on it, laying her bag on
          the floor beside her.
          
                                     TERRI
                        You got anything to drink?
          
          Joey closes the door, raised eyebrows registering her slight
          disapproval at Terri's cavalier attitude.  Her voice, however,
          is polite.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I put some decaf on.  Er ... make
                        yourself comfortable.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Right.
          
          Joey walks past Terri and through to her kitchen, from where we
          hear the sound of COFFEE BEING POURED.
          
          Terri looks around at Joey's room.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES ON ROOM
          
          The large and spacious room suggests that even if Joey is
          dissatisfied with her job she's at least being paid enough to
          make it bearable.  The room is very ordered, very neat, but
          stops short of being prissy.
          
          A very large picture window takes up all of one wall.  At the
          moment of course the drapes are closed.  Another wall is taken
          up by a huge shelf unit packed with books, videos, and CDs.
          Joey's obsession with "getting the whole story" seems to be
          true of her personal life as well as her professional.
          
          ANGLE ON TERRI
          
           - having finished her quick examination, she calls out.
          
                                     TERRI
                        So ... what was your bad dream?
          
          Joey re-enters, carrying two mugs of coffee.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Your dream.  You said you were having a
                        bad dream.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Oh yeah ...
          
                                                                      19
          
          She hands one coffee to Terri and sits opposite her.
          
                                     JOEY
                        ... well, I've been having it for years.
                        It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's
                        ... well, I know what it is.
          
                                     TERRI
                        What is it?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Why are you so interested?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Sorry.
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
          
                                     TERRI
                               (sympathetic, knowing)
                        Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
          
                                     JOEY
                        God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he
                        died before I was born.  He died in
                        Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met
                        him.  We don't even know the details.  I
                        dream of battlefields.  Of searching.
                        Of trying to find out.
          
                                     TERRI
                        That's great.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What?
          
                                     TERRI
                        No ... I mean, it's not like great about
                        your dad or anything.  It's just I don't
                        dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help
                        if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ...
                        No, so it's always neat for me to hear
                        about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like
                        everybody has another world except me.
                        You know what I mean?
          
                                     JOEY
                        I know what you're saying but ... Never?
                        You've never had a dream?  No, you know,
                        you do.  You must.  What you mean is you
                        don't remember them.
          
          
          
                                                                      20
          
                                     TERRI
                        Whatever.  All I know is - this is it
                        for me.  Just me, my bag, and a series
                        of shithead boyfriends.  It'd be good to
                        see something else.  Have a nighttime
                        life.  Be somebody different.
          
          Terri pauses, then smiles like she's just realized something.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Hey ... this is great, isn't it?  Just
                        girls talking.  Like having a
                        conversation?  Good coffee.  You got a
                        cigarette?
          
          Joey waits, letting herself catch up with Terri's good-natured
          but marginally strung-out personality.  She looks around the
          room as if trying to remember where there are cigarettes.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Uh ...  yeah.  Yeah, somewhere.  Wait a
                        minute.
          
          Joey crosses to the big shelf-unit and pulls out a concealed
          pack of cigarettes, a Zippo lighter, and an ashtray from behind
          a shelf of videos.  We notice that the videos are THE WORLD AT
          WAR, volumes 1 thru 26.  She brings the smokes to Terri.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?
          
                                     JOEY
                        I'm trying to quit.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You
                        think you're going to live forever?
          
          She smiles and proffers the pack to Joey who shrugs, smiles,
          and takes one.  Terri picks up the Zippo and sparks it. A huge
          FLAME leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror
          from Terri.  Joey pulls the lighter back from Terri and closes
          the lid extinguishing the flame.  Terri draws a book of matches
          from her pocket shakily attempts to light her cigarette.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's
                        temperamental.
          
                                     TERRI
                        It's okay.  It's just someone burned me
                        once.
          
          
          
                                                                      21
          
          Joey takes the book of matches from Terri's hands and lights
          both cigarettes.  Terri takes a long, fearful look at the
          burning flame and then takes a deep, calming drag of her
          cigarette.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Wanna know how I look at it?  Way I see
                        it is ... you give up, right?  Three
                        days later, you get hit by a fucking
                        truck and you know - you just KNOW 
                        that your last thought as you go under
                        those wheels'd be "Jesus H. Christ, I
                        coulda smoked another three packs!"
          
          She lays the book of matches down.  Joey's eyes go to them.

          Black letters on the dark-grey cover: UNDER THE UNDERGROUND.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY AND TERRI
          
          Terri's eyes flick to the match-book and her mood changes,
          becoming subdued and a little sullen.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Oh.  You wanna talk about that stuff.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Yes I do.  Terri, something awful
                        happened to that boy.  I have to find
                        out what it was.
          
                                     TERRI
                        But I don't know anything!  Really.  I
                        just came out of the club and the kid
                        was already in the street.  He ...
          
                                     JOEY
                        Did you know him?
          
                                     TERRI
                        No.  I'd seen him in there a few times
                        before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never
                        like danced with him or anything.
                        Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've
                        taken it from the statue.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Taken what?
          
                                     TERRI
                        The thing!  He was lying there in the
                        street, moaning.  But he pointed at it
                        ...
                                                                      22
          
                                     JOEY
                        Wait a minute.  He was already ...
                        wounded ... when you found him?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Yeah!  That's what I'm saying!  And it
                        was lying next to him.  And he pointed
                        at it before he passed out and ...
          
                                     JOEY
                        Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the
                        chains come from?
          
                                     TERRI
                        That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
          
          Terri rummages in her bag, getting hold of something.
          
                                     TERRI
                        He said they came out of this.
          
          She holds her hand out and the camera TRACKS in to meet it.
          
          ANGLE ON TERRI'S HAND/BOX
          
          Resting on her palm is a black cube about 4 inches square.  It
          has the same matt-black carbonized look as the pillar and is
          recognizable as one of the "carvings" we saw on it.
          
          There is fine filigree pattern-work over each of its surfaces
          and, to audiences familiar with the HELLRAISER movies, the box
          is recognizable despite its black coating; it is the Lament
          Configuration, the puzzle box that opens the doors to Hell.
          
          There is a stubby shard of material protruding from one side of
          the box - presumably where the boy from ER had broken it off
          the pillar.  Camera favors this jagged shard as we

          ANGLE ON PILLAR
          
          VERY CLOSE on its upper left section.  We are looking at a hole
          in the pillar that matches the pattern of the shard on the Box.
          
          CUT TO WIDE
          
          The club is empty.  The dim lighting of working hours has been
          replaced with the sickly gleam of one or two fluorescent tubes
          and the club has that eerie not-quite-right look that all night
          places have when subjected to a harsher light.
          
                                                                      23
          
          Two WORKERS are in the final stages of clearing the night's
          debris - emptying trash into big black plastic bags, wiping
          down tables and bars etc.
          
          Work completed, they head to the main exit.
          
          One of them hits the light switches so that the fluorescent
          clarity is again replaced by the more appropriate dim lighting.
          The other shouts across the apparently deserted club.
          
                                     WORKER
                        All done, Mr. Monroe.
          
          They stand a second but no response comes.  The first turns to
          the second and shrugs.
          
                                     WORKER
                               (mouthing silently)
                        Ass hole.
          
          His co-worker grins and they let themselves out.
          
          A beat.  Another door opens into the club and JP Monroe  the
          club's owner and the man we saw buy the pillar -  walks into
          the main room of the club from his private room at the back.
          
          JP walks out into the shadowed darkness of his small kingdom.
          He describes a circle around the dance floor, throwing glances
          at his odd sculptures, and finally walks into the center of the
          room to stand before the pride of his collection, the pillar.
          
          The pillar of course is stationary at this time, though it is
          still mounted upside down.
          
          JP smiles possessively at the pillar - and then registers the
          mutilation where the Box has been ripped away.
          
                                     JP
                        What the ... ?
          
          He leans in closer to stare at the hole.
          
          Suddenly, jarringly, there is a quiet but distinct SQUEAK that
          seems to come from within the hole.
          
          JP starts back a little, a small expression of anxiety on his
          normally supercilious face.  He glances to right and left, gets
          a grip, and leans forward again.
          
          ANGLE ON PILLAR/HOLE
          
           - as, again, the noise comes.  Is it a squeak - or is it the
          creaking shifting of hidden machinery, hidden chains?
          
          
                                                                      24
          
          JP's hand moves tentatively into shot, approaching the hole.
          Slowly, slowly, it reaches wrist-deep into the blackness.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
          VERY CLOSE on JP's face - quizzical, enquiring ... and suddenly
          contorted in pain!
          
                                     JP
                        Aaaaaahh!!
          
          ANGLE ON PILLAR/HOLE
          
           - as JP's hand whips out of the hole, shaking in shock and
          pain.  A rat is hanging on to one of JP's fingers, its sharp
          teeth buried in the flesh!
          
          JP swings his arm violently through the air, dislodging the rat
          with the force of his swing.  A spray of blood is seen to come
          from JP's wounded finger.
          
          ANGLE ON RAT
          
           - as it lands heavily in a shadowed corner of the club and
          scurries away deeper into the darkness, squeaking furiously.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
           - as he looks down at his finger, face snarling.
          
                                     JP
                        Son of a ...
          
          ANGLE ON FINGER
          
          VERY CLOSE.  Blood seeps from the tiny teeth marks.
          
                                     JP
                                   (off)
                        ... bi ...
          
          JP's voice is cut off by a strange SIZZLING NOISE heard OFF.
          
          JP's face moves up to look at the pillar.  A look of awe and
          shock crosses his face.
          
          ANGLE ON PILLAR
          
          Some small drops of blood stand out bright red on the blackness
          of the pillar.  The sizzling noise is coming from them.
          
          Suddenly the drops draw together magically into one large ruby
          of blood - already larger than possibility would allow.  Then
          it gets wierder; the blood suddenly dissipates into six or
          seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar.
                                                                      25
          
          The streams of blood don't simply fall straight.  They seem to
          follow some pre-gouged pattern, running down the pillar tracing
          the blackened organic contours of the carvings.
          
          They all culminate at the point of Pinhead's chin - and then
          separate again, running over his frozen black face along the
          carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features.
          
          When every canal line on the demon's face is filled neatly with
          blood, a BLUE LIGHT seems to glow from within the pillar
          through Pinhead's face, giving it temporarily the blue tone he
          had enjoyed in (un)life.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
          CLOSE on his awe-struck face - bathed in reflected blue light.
          
          ANGLE ON PINHEAD
          
           - as gradually the blueness subsides again, the visible blood
          vanishing with it, leaving the same frozen implacable blackness
          as before but charged now with a waiting power.

          CLOSE ON STOVE TOP
          
          A frying pan sits atop a burner.  it contains the ugliest mess
          of scrambled eggs you have ever seen ... or perhaps it's an
          omelette.  There are other ingredients in there but they're
          burnt so black they're unrecognizable.  At least half of the
          mixture lies all over the stove top instead of in the pan.

          VARIOUS ANGLES
          
           - showing the chaos all around the kitchen: Spilled flour on
          work surfaces; Egg-shells on the linoleum; A knocked-over glass
          of orange juice, the juice soaking into a piece of kitchen
          roll; Coffee as black and thick as a mix of Indian ink and
          molasses.

          Joey, in her dressing-gown, stands in the doorway with a
          shocked expression on her face.
          
          Terri, in an oversized man's shirt, stands by the stove holding
          a fish-slice and smiling nervously.
          
                                     TERRI
                        I figured I'd make breakfast.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice
                        of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always
                        this ... exploratory?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time.
                        Kitchen virgin, that's me.
          
          Joey nods slowly, crossing to a cabinet and taking out some
          instant coffee.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I'll boil some water.

                        I'll do it!
          
                                     JOEY
                        No!  No, that's OK.  I like to.  I love
                        boiling water.  It's a specialty of
                        mine.  Why don't you go watch cartoons?
          
          Joey watches Terri walk out of the kitchen, sighs in relief,
          and grabs the kettle.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S AP'T.
          
          Joey sits, drinking her coffee, as Terri walks round the room
          with hers.
          
                                     TERRI
                        This is great.  And it's yours?  You
                        like own it?
          
                                     JOEY
                        The bank owns it.  But I'm working on
                        it.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I
                        haven't even had a room of my own since
                        I was fifteen years old.
          
          
                                                                      27

                        Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
          
          Terri walks past Joey's TV set (sound down, cartoons playing).
          
          ANGLE ON TV
          
          The Box is on top of the TV.  In the warm light of morning it
          seems innocuous and harmless, like just another ornament.
          
          DIFFERENT ANGLE
          
           - as Terri walks on, pausing by the shelves of books.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of
                        course I've read them.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like
                        all these people discovering who they
                        used to be.  You know, like
                        reincarnation?  It was really good.  You
                        ever read that?
          
                                     JOEY
                        I don't think so.  But it's a
                        fascinating subject.  Did you ...
          
          But Terri has already moved on.  She is by the big picture
          window.  The drapes are now open.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Great view!  Great view!  Look at this!
          
          Joey stands and walks to join Terri.
          
                                     JOEY

                        view ...
          
          GIRLS' POV - THROUGH WINDOW
          
          Joey's apartment is on a high floor and her window overlooks
          many lower buildings, giving a view of the city beyond.

                                    (off)
                        ... but it is good.  You know, over to
                        the left, you can ...
          
                                     TERRI
                               (looking to right and pointing)
                        Who's that?
          
          On the flat roof of a nearby building, a RETARDED TEENAGE BOY
          sits motionless in an old rusty deck chair next to a small
          Jerry-built pigeon coop.  Its door is open and it is empty.
          
          The boy is some distance from the girls but his solitude, his
          stillness, and the empty coop beside him lend the scene an
          atmosphere of sadness and loss.
          
          As Joey tells his story, we INTERCUT between the POV of the
          roof and the girls at the window.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I don't know his name ...  I saw the
                        whole story.  A wounded bird was on his
                        roof.  I could hear its cries from here.
                        He went straight to it.  I couldn't've.
                        I'd be frozen between pity and fear.
                        But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly
                        to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it.
                        Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday
                        he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the
                        pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn.
                        Learn that there was one more thing he
                        had to do to make the rescue complete.
                        And one day, just as afternoon became
                        evening, he leaned over, opened the
                        cage, and walked away.  Didn't look
                        back.  But he heard the sound of its
                        wings.

                                     TERRI
                        Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  He knows it won't.  It was his
                        final act of love and part of him knows
                        that and part of him doesn't yet.

                        Bullshit!  He should've kept it.  It'd
                        live longer!  It's dangerous out there!
                        People get hurt!

          Terri shrugs, gives a nervous smile.
          
          Joey crosses to the TV, picks up the Box and weighs it in her

                        OK.  OK.  It's a done deal.  But look 
                        you have to help me.  I've got to solve
                        this thing.  I've got to know what's
                        going on.
          
          Terri follows across the room and sits on the sofa.
          
                                     TERRI
                        But I don't know what's going on.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Maybe not.  But you know more than I do.
                        You know something about this box.
                        Something about a statue?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it
                        and I figured ...
          
                                     JOEY
                        Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
          
                                     TERRI
                        No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like
                        owns the club.  You know?  You were
                        there?  He bought the statue.
          
                                     JOEY
                        That you found.  What do you mean you
                        found it?
          
          
          
          
          
                                                                      30

                        I was downtown looking for a ... a
                        friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there
                        was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa
                        weird shit in there.  I saw this statue.
                        Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it.
                        You've seen the club.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Would you know this store again?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Sure.  Why?
          
                                     JOEY
                        It's Saturday morning.  Let's go
                        shopping.
          
          
          EXT.   DERELICT STREET   DAY
          
          Joey's Mazda 323 drives down the street.
          
          The daylight street is still creepy but in a different way; No
          bums, no trash-can fires, nothing.  It has the feel of a ghost
          town, as if nothing has breathed here for years.
          
          ANGLE IN CAR
          
          Joey, at the wheel, has a disbelieving look on her face.
          
          Terri, smoking, flicks ash through her wound-down window.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
          
                                     JOEY
                        What on earth were you doing down here?
          
          An evasive silence.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Terri?
          
                                     TERRI
                        Buying some drugs, alright?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Oh, Terri ...
          
          
          
                                                                      31
          
                                     TERRI
                        For somebody else, alright?  Not for me.
                        I don't do that shit anymore.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Then you shouldn't even be around it.
                        You know, it's ...
          
                                     TERRI
                        Here!  Here!  Pull over!
          
          Joey brings the car to a halt outside the antique store.
          
          Terri scrambles out of the passenger door.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Yeah.  See.  I told you it was here.
          
          CLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - as she looks at Terri from behind, her face worried for her
          new and screwed-up friend.
          
          
          INT.   CARDUCCIS ANTIQUES   DAY
          
          Joey and Terri enter the store.
          
          The store is different, its selection of merchandise reduced.
          The 50's and 60's junk hardware is still there, along with some
          of the more mundane Victoriana, but it seems more "normal" 
          none of the odd items of punishment memorabilia are there.
          
          Also, because it is daylight, the store seems merely old,
          interesting, and musty, not creepy or odd.
          
          There seems to be no-one in attendance.
          
          ANGLE ON GIRLS
          
           - as they walk through the store.
          
                                     MAMA
                                    (off)
                        Can I help?
          
          The voice startles the girls and they jump around to face the
          counter as MAMA CARDUCCI moves into view from beneath it.
          
          Mama, an ancient and slightly eccentric Italian-American woman
          eyes the girls with the suspicion of somebody who hasn't had a
          customer in decades.  Not aggressive, just surprised.
          
          
          
                                                                      32
          
                                     JOEY
                        Yes.  Thank you.  We were wondering ...
                        Terri, show her the box.
          
          Terri removes the box from her purse and holds it up.
          
                                     MAMA
                        No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my
                        customers.  Have you tried ...
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  No, you don't understand.  We're
                        not selling it.  It came from here.  We
                        want ...
          
                                     MAMA
                        Everything sold as is.  No guarantees.
                        No returns.
          
                                     JOEY
                        No.  We want ...
          
                                     MAMA
                        I took back everything bought on a whim,
                        I'd have no business.  I ...
          
                                     TERRI
                        Lady, will you shut the fuck up and give
                        her a break.
          
          A sudden silence.  Both Mama and Joey stare at Terri in
          surprise.
          
          Mama looks back at Joey.
          
                                     MAMA
                        Quite a mouth.  So what's the problem?
                        You tell me.  You I like.
          
          Joey smiles.  Terri raises her eyes to heaven.  Mama waits.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Thank you.  This came off a ... statue?
                        A pillar.  We wondered if you knew
                        anything about the piece.  About where
                        it came from.
          
          Mama squints at the box, as if trying to recognize it.
          
                                     MAMA
                        Oh ... yeah.  Yeah.  That thing.  Ugly.
                        Real ugly.  I sold that?
          
          Mama's eyes scan the store.
          
                                                                      33
          
                                     MAMA
                        Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made
                        the store feel strange.  Who'd make such
                        a thing?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us
                        anything about it?
          
                                     MAMA
                        It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony-
                        bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What else came with it?  Anything still
                        here?
          
                                     MAMA
                        Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff
                        nobody'd ever want.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Can we see?
          
                                     MAMA
                        You gonna buy?
          
                                     JOEY
                        I don't know.  Maybe.
          
                                     MAMA
                        Right at the back there.  Middle
                        shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff.
                        I'd do you a good price.
          
          CUT TO:
          
          ANGLE ON REAR OF STORE
          
          Joey and Terri approach an old shelf unit along the rear wall.
          
          A shaft of sunlight throws a square of light on the wooden
          floor a few yards in front of the shelves.
          
          Joey takes up a big bulging manilla folder from the shelves and
          begins to look through it.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Terri, check out the other folder.
          
          Terri, still holding her purse and the box, looks around for
          somewhere to put them.  All the shelves are full.  She lays
          them on the floor in the square of sunlight and joins Joey at
          the shelves, grabbing up the second folder.
          
                                                                      34
          
                                     TERRI
                        What am I looking for?
          
                                     JOEY
                        God knows.  Anything.  Contacts.  Clues.
          
          Terri opens up the folder and begins to pace the floor as she
          flicks through the contents.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Jesus.  You're gonna pay her for this
                        shit?  It's like fucking business papers
                        for God's sake!
          
          Bored, Terri wanders off to lean against another shelf-unit.
          
          ANGLE OVER JOEY'S SHOULDER ON FOLDER
          
           - as she flicks through the contents.
          
          Terri's dismissive summary seems justified.  All Joey sees are
          obscure and meaningless case-notes and paperwork.  Each item is
          letter-headed THE CHANNARD INSTITUTE.
          
          Joey's hand reaches a large envelope.  Scrawled in hand across
          it is the phrase DR. CHANNARD - PERSONAL PAPERS.  Joey draws
          the contents out and begins to sift through them.
          
          The first item is a dusty, black-and-white photograph of an
          officer in English Army uniform, circa 1920.  Joey blows the
          dust from the photo.
          
          LOW ANGLE - ON BOX
          
           - which sits on the floor in the shaft of sunlight, the dust
          from the photo settling next to it.
          
          ON JOEY
          
          The next photo is that of a beautiful young woman.  Joey flips
          it over.  Gummed on the back is a type-written slip that says
          COTTON, KIRSTY  CASE NO.  5719.
          
          ON BOX
          
          The sounds of the girls flicking through papers is heard OFF
          and then FADES as something strange begins to happen.
          
          Suddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by
          an invisible wind.  It is drawn up so that it forms an
          impossible spiral in the air.  Spinning like a miniature
          hurricane, it hovers over the box.  The sunlight seems to grow
          brighter.  Is it just reflections on the metalwork designs or
          is the box itself glowing and shining?
          
                                                                      35
          
          CLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY'S FACE
          
           - as her eyes flick back and forth as she scans ...
          
          Joey turns another item and her face registers surprise at what
          she is seeing ...
          
          The next item in the folder is a Xerox sheet, a reproduction of
          what appears to be an ancient document.
          
          It is a diagram, like a designer's drawing or plan.  And it is
          of the box seen from various angles.
          
          CLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY'S FACE
          
           - as she realizes what she is looking at.
          
                                     JOEY
                                  (softly)
                        Alright ...
          
          Joey turns, folder in hand, to look at the box on the floor and
          compare it to the diagram.
          
          Joey gasps.
          
          The miniature tornado of spiralling dust suddenly disappears
          inside the apparently sealed box as if sucked down into it.
          
          As if on cue, the shaft of sunlight disappears behind a cloud
          as the last particle of dust disappears into the box.
          
          Joey, mouth open in shock, lets the folder drop from her hand.
          The sound of its splayed contents hitting the floor alerts
          Terri, who walks back round from the other shelf unit.
          
          Terri looks at the dropped contents and then up at Joey.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Joey ... ?
          
                                     JOEY
                               (still staring at Box)
                        Help me pick 'em up, Terri.  I think
                        the lady just made a sale.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   EARLY EVENING
          
          Joey is sitting behind a desk.  She has a phone in one hand and
          a pen in the other.
          
          Spread out over the desk are various documents - the photo of
          Kirsty, the diagram of the box, type-written transcripts etc -
          and a scratch-pad on which Joey has scrawled several numbers.
                                                                      36
          
          Joey is in mid-conversation on the phone.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Yeah ... yeah ... yeah ... No, it's
                        important that I speak to ... What?  No,
                        don't ...          (a beat)       Put.
                        Me.  On.  Hold.  You.  Stupid.  Bitch.
          
          Joey slams the phone down.
          
          She stares at the papers, at the scratch pad, takes a deep
          breath, and punches out a number on the phone.
          
          This time Joey's voice is different.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Hi.  Now listen.  And listen good.  I'm
                        the Station Manager at W-QQY.  For the
                        last half-hour you've been dicking
                        around with my assistant.  Let me tell
                        you something.  With or without your co-
                        operation we are making this expose.  I
                        assume you're smart enough to guess
                        which version is going to make you look
                        good.  Now, if you can't put one hand on
                        that cassette and the other on a FedEx
                        man's butt within thirty seconds then
                        you damn well better put me through to
                        somebody who can.
          
          A pause while somebody jumps through hoops at the other end.
          
          Joey's voice transmogrifies again; now it's a seductive,
          persuasive purr.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Dr.  Fallon?  How nice of you to take my
                        call.  I understand you're in charge of
                        video archive from the Channard
                        Institute ... ?
          
          
          INT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT
          
          Another night in Under The Underground
          
          Kids dance.
          
          Customers jostle at the bar.
          
          Couples neck in shadowed corners.
          
          Loud Metal music blasts out from speakers next to the various
          sculptures on the walls and ceiling.
          
                                                                      37
          
          The center of the dance-floor is packed.
          
          The pillar is missing.
          
          ANGLE ON BAR
          
          Sitting alone at a bar stool - though surrounded by tightly-
          packed customers - is SANDY, a very pretty teenage girl.  She
          is the same basic type as Terri; blonde, frail, young.  Too
          young, in fact, to be legally in a club like this.
          
          Sandy stares at her empty glass - and stares at it wistfully
          enough to suggest she doesn't have the money to get it
          refilled.  She is trying to keep up a cool impassive face but
          her eyes betray her basically vulnerable character.
          
          REVERSE ANGLE
          
          Sitting at the opposite end of the bar, his eye-line confirming
          he is looking at Sandy, is JP Monroe.
          
          The bar-stool beside JP is occupied by a TEENAGE BOY who has
          his back to the bar and is talking to a GROUP of his FRIENDS.
          
          JP has a speculative, predatory look on his face.  Without
          shifting his gaze, he raises his hand and within seconds the
          BARMAN is leaning over to hear his request.
          
          CLOSE on Sandy as a full glass is placed in front of her.  Laid
          alongside the glass is a beautiful long-stemmed red rose.
          
          Sandy looks surprised at the drink and then smiles in delight
          at the rose.  She raises her eyes and looks across the bar.
          
          JP returns the smile.
          
          He turns to the Boy beside him and murmurs something unheard.
          
          The boy glances round, as if ready to argue with whoever is
          speaking to him.  On recognizing JP, however, he vacates the
          seat without an argument and stands to join his friends.
          
          JP looks back across the bar at Sandy and gestures at the empty
          stool beside him, an attractive welcoming smile on his face.
          
          Sandy gets up and, carrying the drink and the rose, makes her
          way across to sit beside JP.
          
          ANGLE ON JP AND SANDY
          
          The deafening music playing in the club means that they have to
          lean in close to hear each other speak.
          
                                     JP
                        Welcome.
                                                                      38
          
                                     SANDY
                        You're JP Monroe, right?
          
                                     JP
                        Uh-huh.
          
                                     SANDY
                        And this is your club.  Great club.  I
                        really love it here.  Great club.
          
                                     JP
                        Thank you.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Thank you for the drink.  And the rose.
                        Wow.  That's ... really nice.
          
                                     JP
                        It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
          
                                     SANDY
                        A prize?  For what?
          
                                     JP
                        You see, everyday I have my friend John
                        here bring ...
          
                                     SANDY
                        The barman?  I thought he was called
                        Rick?
          
                                     JP
                        He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind
                        if I continue?
          
                                     SANDY
                        I'm sorry.
          
                                     JP
                        Everyday I have my friend Rick here
                        bring a newly-cut red rose in with him
                        and keep it behind the bar.  And I award
                        it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here
                        who look better than ...
          
                                     JP
                        Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down.
                        If you have a quality, be proud of it...
          
          While talking, and without taking his eyes off Sandy, JP
          gestures at the barman and their glasses.
          
                                                                      39
          
                                     JP
                        ... Let it define you.  Whatever it is.
                        Most of the roses die behind the bar.
                        This is the first I've given out for
                        nearly a month.
          
                                     SANDY
                        No.  Really?
          
          Two full glasses join the still half-full ones on the bar.
          
                                     JP
                        Yes really.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Wow.  Thank you.
          
                                     JP
                        No.  Thank you.
          
          ANGLE ON GLASSES
          
          TIME-FADE
          
          ANGLE ON GLASSES
          
          Now there are six empty glasses on the bar and two half-full
          ones.
          
          ANGLE UP TO JP AND SANDY ...
          
           - except they're not there.  The two bar-stools are empty.
          
          
          INT.  JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT
          
          The music OFF from the club is dull and muffled.
          
          JP1s private room is the size - and shares the general
          appearance of - an expensive studio apartment.
          
          His room looks like an annex to his club - black walls, black
          fittings, artworks of elegant cruelty - show that JP's taste
          for the bizarre is not just professional.
          
          Camera explores the room as the sound of BREATHING grows OFF.
          
          ANGLE ON PILLAR
          
           - now the right way up, it stands in a corner of the room.  As
          usual, it looks jarring and impressive but it doesn't really
          seem out of place in JP's room.
          
          The Breathing OFF becomes mixed with MOANS and SMALL CRIES.
          
                                                                      40
          
          ANGLE ON BED
          
          JP and Sandy, both naked, are on the bed making love.  Well,
          maybe Sandy's making love.  JP's having sex.
          
          It is a selfish, phallocentric scene, concentrating on JP's
          concern only for his own gratification.  It may be an erotic
          sight, but it's not a pretty one.
          
          JP is on top.  He has hold of both Sandy's wrists in one of his
          hands and his body is working away rhythmically.  He is half-
          upright, looking down at her.  No kissing.
          
          CLOSE on JP's face - his eyes open, staring down at Sandy.
          
          CLOSE on Sandy's face - her eyes closed, half in pleasure, half
          in shame.
          
          SMASH-CUT TO PILLAR
          
          CLOSE on Pinhead's face.  Suddenly, horribly, the monster's
          eyes fly open and his frozen face stares down at the lovers.  A
          BLUE LIGHT seems to pulse from within the pillar, lending color
          to Pinhead's face.
          
          Pinhead continues to watch the love-making until it comes to a
          climax.
          
          As JP GROANS out his orgasm and collapses forward onto Sandy's
          body, Pinhead's eyes close.  The BLUE LIGHT disappears and the
          pillar is just the pillar again.
          
          
          INT.  MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON DESK
          
           - FAVORING the telephone/answering machine, its red message
          light blinking in the darkness of the apartment.
          
          Heard OFF is the sound of Joey coming in to her apartment -
          doors opening and closing, bags being put down, footsteps etc.
          
          Joey's hand comes into frame and presses the message button.
          
          WIDER ANGLE
          
           - as Joey waits for her machine and glances around the room
          for Terri.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Terri?
          
          ANGLE ON SOFA - JOEY'S POV
          
                                                                      41
          
          The sofa is empty.
          
          Joey looks puzzled and is about to call again when the machine
          kicks in.
          
                                     FALLON
                                    (on ansafone)
                        Ms.  Summerskill.  Joanne.  Hello.  This
                        is Dr. Fallon.  Martin.  Your reference
                        material is on its way to you.  I very
                        much enjoyed talking to you and I hope
                        that if I'm ever in town you'll do me
                        the honor of (sqwaaaaalk)
          
          Joey has her finger on the fast forward button.

                        In your dreams, pal.
          
          The chipmunk-squeal of Fallon's voice is replaced by the
          warning-beep of a second message.  Joey lets it play.
          
                                     WOMAN
                                 (on ansafone)
                         ... your number from your resume.
                        Which was very impressive, by the way.
                        My name is Sharon Leech and you can
                        reach me here at K-YZY in Monterey, area
                        code 805 ... (sqwaaalk)
          
          Joey stops the tape.
          
                                     JOEY
                                 (to herself)
                        Shit. Why now? Why not last week? Oh ...
          
          She glances round at the empty room again, troubled by Terri's
          absence.  She crosses to her bedroom door.
          
          
          INT.   JOEY'S BEDROOM   NIGHT
          
          Joey enters the darkened room - and then stops a few feet from
          the door.
          
          Terri - lit only by the moonlight through the blinds - is lying
          on one side of Joey's bed fast asleep.  Apart from her shoes,
          which she has kicked off, she is fully dressed.
          
          Joey approaches the bed and watches her sleeping friend, her
          face sympathetic, affectionate, and troubled.
          
          Joey reaches over, takes one of the pillows from the other side
          of the bed, and lays it at the bottom end.
          
                                                                      42
          
          She slips off her shoes, shrugs off her jacket, and -
          delicately, carefully - climbs on to the other side of the bed,
          laying her head on the pillow she had moved.
          
                                     JOEY
                                  (whispered)
                        Goodnight, Terri ...
          
          
          INT.   JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT
          
          JP, on his bed in his shorts enjoying a post-coital cigarette,
          blows smoke-rings at the ceiling and all but ignores Sandy.
          
          Sandy has put some of her clothes back on and is wandering
          around the room, admiring it and chattering.
          
                                     SANDY
                        So cool ...
          
          She approaches the pillar ... leans in close ... closer ... and
          ... nothing happens.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Radical.
          
          She walks on to look at a painting on one of the walls.
          
          ANGLE ON PAINTING
          
          It's a painstakingly rendered but crudely imagined piece.  The
          kind of crap you'd buy in a Melrose gallery.
          
          Perhaps it's called Biker Crucifixion.  Night-time, somewhere
          rural. A Hell's Angel, arms outstretched and stripped to the
          waist, is tied to a tree by cruelly-tight barbed wire wrapped
          around his body.  At the foot of the tree his biker friends
          party, drink, and fuck, Harleys parked in the distance.  The
          crucified Angel's eyes are raised to the Moon.  He's smiling.
          
          WIDER ANGLE ON SANDY AND PAINTING
          
                                     SANDY
                        Wow.  You've got great taste.  This ...
                        well ... this really says it, you know?
                        It's really ... dark.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
          Still staring at the ceiling, JP pulls a pained face - like
          he's heard this embarrassing shit a hundred times.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Don't you think?
          
                                                                      43
          
                                     JP
                        Mmn-hmnn.
          
          Sandy turns to look at JP, troubled by his unresponsiveness.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Do you mind me talking about your stuff?
          
                                     JP
                        Unh-unh.
          
          A beat.  Sandy stares at JP.  JP stares at the ceiling.
          
                                     SANDY
                        If it bothers you, just say so.
          
          JP sighs.
          
                                     JP
                        It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not
                        interested.
          
                                     SANDY
                        Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
          
          JP blows a smoke ring at the ceiling.
          
          Sandy walks back across the room to stand at the foot of the
          bed.  ( And yes, fright fans, this does put her in front of the
          pillar - though hopefully the blossoming argument will distract
          audience attention.)
          
                                     SANDY
                        But you gave me a rose ...
          
                                     JP
                        And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody
                        else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
          
                                     SANDY
                        You shit.  Who do you think you are?
          
                                     JP
                        I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch.
                        Now get the fuck out of my life.
          
                                     SANDY
                        You ... I can't fucking believe you, you
                        bastard!  You get me in here ...
          
                                     JP
                        Right.  Like you were hog-tied or
                        something.
          
          
                                                                      44
          
                                     SANDY
                        Look at you!  You think you're some God
                        damn Prince or something.  With your
                        shitty little Kingdom out there and all
                        this ugly shi ....
          
          Sandy is waving her arms to illustrate her point and, halfway
          through her last line, has turned to indicate the pillar.
          
          Suddenly - BAM! BIG SCARE MOMENT! - two blackened arms fly out
          from the center of the pillar and grab Sandy's gesturing arms.
          
          The BLUE LIGHT burns from within, illuminating Pinhead's face
          as his eyes open, filled with demonic glee and hunger.
          
          An impossible WIND begins to whistle through the room, as if an
          echoed glimpse of a storm in Hell.
          
          Sandy screams in mortal terror.
          
          JP jumps from the bed, cigarette falling to the floor.  He
          backs away to the opposite wall, face shocked, scared shitless.
          
                                     JP
                        Jesus Christ!
          
          Pinhead smiles sardonically.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Not quite.
          
          Pinhead's arms pull Sandy tight against the pillar and his
          face, stifling her scream.
          
          JP flattened against the far wall, watches in horror as Sandy,
          held tight against the pillar, suffers a horrible death:
          
          Sandy's life-force is sucked from her.  Drawn into the pillar.
          Into Pinhead.
          
          It is a matter of seconds only but, in those few seconds -
          
          Her body begins to collapse in on itself, turning grey and
          lifeless.  It is made worse by the fact that until the very end
          Sandy keeps struggling, writhing in the grasp of the monster.
          
          The wind keeps blowing through the room.
          
          Finally, a dry lifeless husk, she is dropped to the floor.
          
          The Blue Light fades from within the pillar. The wind
          disappears.
          
          
          
                                                                      45
          
          The pillar is again black and stationary.  But its contours are
          different, more rounded.  It looks more organic, as if shifting
          its raw material into new alignments, new configurations.  The
          pillar seems to be in a process of becoming.  And the obvious
          suggestion is that what it is becoming is Pinhead.
          
          Pinhead's head, arms, and torso now protrude from the pillar.
          They are not completely free and - now that the "eating" of
          Sandy is concluded - seem incapable of independent movement but
          there is plainly a lot more of him than there was before.
          
          Even though the blue light has faded, Pinhead's face is
          noticeably different.  It is blue-tinged and more fleshy in
          appearance.  Capable of movement.  And speech.
          
          ANGLE ON JP
          
           - who has sunk to the floor, staring at the pillar.
          
                                     JP
                        What ... What ... ?
          
          WIDER ANGLE
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        What did you see?  The same as I.
                        Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You
                        saw the working of the world in
                        miniature.
          
          JP shakes his head in denial.  But he's already a little more
          together than he was: after all, the pillar can't move and he's
          several yards from it.
          
                                     JP
                        That had nothing to do with the world.
                        Not this one, anyway.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        On the contrary.  It has everything to
                        do with the world.  And our dreams of
                        how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed
                        the girl?
          
                                     JP
                        Yes.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
          
                                     JP
                        No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... 
                        No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
          
          Pinhead laughs.
                                                                      46
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        How uncomfortable that word must feel on
                        your lips.  Evil.  Good.  There is no
                        Good, Monroe.  There is no Evil.  There
                        is only the flesh and the patterns to
                        which we can submit it.  You will help
                        me to ...
          
          JP shakes his head in furious denial.
          
                                     JP
                        No.  No no no.  No fuckin' way.  I'm
                        gone ...
          
          Grabbing at his jeans, JP heads out of his room.  Rapidly.
          
          
          EXT.   CITY STREETS, OUTSIDE CLUB   NEXT DAY
          
          The sun is high.  It's about noon.
          
          Like most clubs of its type, Under The Underground's exterior
          is far from prepossessing.  It's set in an old brick warehouse
          in a run-down section of town.
          
          JP's Range Rover pulls up and JP gets out, carrying a long slim
          black bag.  He glances round the all-but-deserted street and
          enters the club.
          
          
          INT.  JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   DAY
          
          CLOSE on Pinhead's face; in repose, back to its statue-like
          state.
          
          The sound of the door OFF opens the monster's eyes.
          
          JP enters, closing the door behind him.
          
          He doesn't look at the pillar.  He stays by the door and keeps
          his eyes on the long black bag he has brought in with him.
          
          He unzips it.  His manner is that of a man who has made a
          decision and is not about to listen to contrary argument.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                               (off)
                        Another offering?
          
          JP doesn't respond.  He draws a double-barrelled shotgun from
          the bag, cocks it, and loads it.
          
          JP turns to face the pillar, drawing a bead on Pinhead.
          
          Pinhead's expression is wearily amused.
                                                                      47
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        I'm touched ... That is the gun you used
                        to kill your parents?
          
          JP visibly staggers as Pinhead lets slip this knowledge.
          
          Pinhead smiles.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        I understand.  Their fortune was so
                        tempting, their affection so
                        conditional.  What else could you do?
          
                                     JP

          He pulls the double trigger.
          
          A massive BLAST resounds around the room but that's about it;
          the 30 ott six is absorbed magically into the pillar.

          INT.   TV STATION, EDITING SUITE   NIGHT
          
          ANGLE ON MONITORS
          
          Many screens fill the frame, all of them crackling with snow.
          
          CUT TO WIDE
          
          Joey is alone at the control desk.  She has a video tape in her
          hand and feeds it into the master machine.
          
          She looks up at the still-ghosting monitors and then presses a
          few buttons on the console.
          
          The snow is replaced by blackness on every monitor with a time
          code ticking away at the bottom of each screen.
          
                                     JOEY
                               (softly)
                        Alright ... Let's see what we got here.
                                                                      49
          
          The blackness on the monitors gives way to multiple images of
          KIRSTY, the girl in the picture in the antique store.
          
          The video image is primitive, shot with a non-professional
          camcorder, and is a simple medium long-shot of Kirsty, dressed
          in a simple white smock, sitting in a hospital room.
          
          Kirsty addresses the camera directly, though occasionally looks
          up to the side as if speaking to an unseen doctor.
          
          INTERCUT through Kirsty's monologue between: A single monitor
          image, the wall of monitors, and the watching and listening
          Joey.

                        I don't know what the Box is.  But I
                        know what it does.  I ...    (looks up
                        to side)     I've said all this before.
                        Do you ...    (blinks, nods, as if
                        listening.  Looks back to camera)  I saw
                        it open.  I opened it.  I saw what came
                        out.  I don't know what else to call
                        them.  Demons.  Demons live in the box.
                        Or come through the box from somewhere
                        else.  It's a gateway to Hell.  Or the
                        South Bronx.     (smiles ruefully at her
                        own joke.  Looks up to side as if
                        chastised for kidding around.  Nods.
                        Continues)     I know you don't believe
                        me.  I know what it sounds like.  But
                        what else ... Jesus, talk to Ronson,
                        talk to the other cops.  They saw the
                        house.  They saw my ... my father ...
          
          Kirsty breaks down into sobs.
          
          QUICK-CUT TO JOEY
          
           - whose expression shows distressed sympathy.  She too has
          lost her father.
          
          ANGLE ON MONITORS
          
          The video image breaks up into white noise and then comes back
          in, as if the camcorder was turned off for a few moments.
          
          When the image returns, Kirsty is smoking a cigarette to help
          calm her.

                        Solving the puzzle means opening the
                        box.  Opening the box means opening
                        doors.  And there are some doors you
                        don't want to open.  And it may be
                        metaphorical to you, Doctor, but you
                        haven't had some blue-faced bastard come
                        at you with hooks and chains.  It isn't
                        delusion, it isn't psychosis.  It's
                        reality.  It's reality.     (Pause.
                        Long drag on the cigarette?)   Maybe not
                        this reality ... but there are others.
                        I've seen them.
          
          Joey's face shows horrified fascination at Kirsty's story.
          There is a conviction in the telling which is working on Joey.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          The room is dimly-lit.
          
          ANGLE ON FLOOR BY TV SET
          
          The floor is littered with video-boxes and tapes.  Other tapes
          are piled on top of the VCR.  It's like somebody has been
          viewing constantly for a week and hasn't put anything away.
          
          ANGLE ON SOFA AND COFFEE TABLE
          
          Many books are lying on the sofa, the table, and the floor.
          Some are lying open, most are closed.
          
          Also on the coffee table are three different soft-drink cans, a
          half- empty cup of coffee, and a very full ash-tray.
          
          ANGLE ON BOOKSHELFS
          
          Terri is standing by the bookshelfs, running her eyes and her
          finger along some titles.
          
          Now we understand the chaos in the room.  Terri's home alone.
          She's bored and trying to find something to hold her interest.
          
          She looks away from the shelves and walks idly over to the TV.
          
          The Box is back on top of the TV.  Terri's hand hovers near the
          on/off switch of the TV.  Then it hesitates and picks up the
          box instead.  Terri holds the box and looks at it.  Her face
          becomes puzzled and she crosses the room to flick on a LIGHT.
          She wanders back to the TV looking at the box.
          
          
          
                                                                      51
          
          It looks different.  Its edges are more sharply defined.  The
          shard where it was broken from the pillar is smaller, smoother.
          The detailed metal-work has some color back and is shining.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Jeez, Joey musta polished you up some.
                        Sometimes I think she's wierder than me.
          
          Terri's voice trails off as she continues to look at the box.
          She turns it in her hands, running her fingers over its
          filigree surfaces.
          
          TRACK in slowly as she cups it in both hands, her eyes moving
          from puzzlement to fascination and concentration.
          
          She rubs her thumbs over the designs.  TRACKING IN continues.
          It's tense.  Is she going to try and work the puzzle?
          
          Suddenly .... BRRRRRRRRR ... the phone rings.
          
          Terri jumps in shock, nearly dropping the box.
          
          She puts the box back on top of the TV and crosses to the
          phone.  She picks it up.

                        That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It
                        really is. You know, I .. are you alone?

                        come over?  You know, nothing heavy,
                        little drink maybe, little talk.  Just
                        see how we both feel?

          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on Terri's face - we can almost see her summon the will-
          power to refuse.
          
                                     TERRI
                        No!  No.  I can't.  I just can't.
          
          She slams the phone down quickly before he can persuade her.
          She takes a couple of deep breaths and walks away from the
          phone.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit.
          
          She looks around.  She looks at the books.  She looks at the
          videos.  She looks at the table.  She looks back at the phone.

                        Hello.  Ms. Summerskill, this is Sharon
                        Leech again from K-YZY in Monterey.
                        Sorry to call so late but I was
                        wondering if you got my other message?
                        Look, I probably shouldn't say this on
                        tape but what the hell ... there's a job
                        here if you want it.  Late-night news
                        reader.  We think you'd be marvelous ..
          
          The machine BEEPS and cuts her off, leaving the message light
          FLASHING.
          
          CLOSE on Terri's face - disappointed and sad.
          
          
          INT.   TV STATION, EDITING SUITE   NIGHT
          
          Joey is still at the desk watching the bank of monitors.
          
          As Kirsty speaks, INTERCUT between Joey and the monitors.
          
                                     KIRSTY
                        (Looks to side)  Again?  (Shrugs. Looks
                        back at camera)  The box.  I don't know
                        where it came from.  I don't know who
                        made it or why.  I only know what it
                        does.  It hurts.  It hurts.   (Looks off
                        to side as if listening.)  How?  (Looks
                        back)  I don't know.  It kind of opens
                        itself.  Your fingers move.  You learn.
                        It wants to open, that's the thing.  And
                        it knows when you want to open it.  And
                        it helps.  And it opens.  And then they
                        come.  The Cenobites.  The demons.
          
          ANGLE ON WALL OF MONITORS
          
          Multiple images of Kirsty speaking those last few lines.
          
          Suddenly, one - and only one - of the monitors suffers a WHITE
          NOISE WIPE-OUT.
          
          Joey glances up at the one ghosting monitor, puzzled - and then
          freezes in shock.
          
          ANGLE ON MONITORS
          
           - as, on the one monitor, a new image suddenly appears:
          
          A hazy, black-and-white image (very grainy, like early
          experimental TV images) of a thirtysomething man in early
          twentieth century military uniform.
          
                                                                      55
          
          The man - ELLIOTT - stares directly out of the monitor screen
          and, just as Kirsty finishes her last line ("The cenobites. The
          demons."), he speaks (in an English accent).
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                                   (on monitor)
                        She's telling the truth, Joey.
          
          Another BURST of WHITE NOISE and the image is gone.
          
          Kirsty is back on that monitor, just like all the others.
          
                                     KIRSTY
                        Look, you can have me tell this ...
          
          Joey remains staring at the haunted monitor, numb with shock.
          What the hell is going on?
          
          Kirsty's voice plays OFF as Joey stares.
          
                                     KIRSTY
                        ...  as often as you want.  There's not
                        going to be any breakthrough.  You might
                        think it's delusion, but it's not.  I
                        saw them.  I looked into their eyes and
                        they looked back at me.  Creatures from
                        Hell.
          
          
          INT.   24-HOUR DINER   NIGHT
          
          A late-night coffee-shop in the early hours of the morning.
          Classic American Diner.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES
          
          Empty booths.
          
          A quiet counter.  A COP perches on a stool drinking coffee.
          
          A TRUCKER in a booth by himself bites methodically on a donut,
          his eyes staring off into the vacancy of the night.
          
          In a corner booth, FOUR KIDS nurse cokes and smoke cigarettes.
          
          ANGLE ON TABLE
          
          A black coffee sits by an ash-tray holding a burning cigarette.

           - sitting at the table staring at the coffee.
          
          She waits.  She takes a drag on the smoke.  She waits.  She
          sips her coffee.  She waits.  She looks up across the diner.
                                                                      56

          She looks back down at her coffee.
          
          The sound of doors opening OFF.  Terri looks up again.
          
          ANGLE FROM DOORS - TERRI IN DISTANCE
          
          A WALKING POV as somebody approaches Terri, whose face breaks
          into a nervous, ambiguous smile of welcome.
          
          REVERSE ANGLE - TERRI'S POV
          
           - as JP walks confidently to her table, smiling.
          
                                     JP
                        Hey, babe.  Thanks for coming.
          
          JP sits down opposite her.  He reaches over and pats her hand.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          Joey enters the unlit main room.  She glances across at the
          sofa.  It's unoccupied.  Joey puts the light on.
          
          She grimaces at the chaos of the room - the piles of videos and
          books - and crosses the room to the bedroom door.  She opens
          the door and looks in.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Terri, we can't bunk up every night!
                        People will ...
          
          The bedroom is empty, nobody on the bed.
          
                                     JOEY
                                    (off)
                        ... talk.  ... Terri?
          
          Joey leaves the door and walks back into the main room.
          
          She looks around and then walks over to the phone.  Something
          has caught her eye.
          
          ANGLE BY PHONE
          
          A hand-scrawled note by the phone reads ENJOY MONTEREY, YOU
          LIAR.
          
          JOEY registers the note.
                                                                      57
          
                                     JOEY
                        Oh shit.
          
          Joey shakes her head sadly.  What can she do?  It's the early
          hours of the morning.  She has no idea where Terri is.  She
          walks back to the bedroom and closes the door behind her.
          
          
          EXT.   DENSE JUNGLE   DAY     (JOEY'S DREAM)
          
          Thick green jungle foliage obscures the view of a POV camera.
          
          The sounds of confused battle are heard OFF; helicopters, gun-
          fire, distant explosions, screams of the dying and the wounded
          
          Leaves and branches SMACK against the frame as the unseen
          dreamer rushes confusedly through the dense forest.
          
          The voices of the Soldiers - distant, echoed, repeated - are
          heard over the roar of battle.
          
                                     SOLDIER 1
                                        (off)
                        He's going.  He's going.  He's going ...
          
                                     SOLDIER 2
                                        (off)
                        We're losing him.  We're losing him.
                        We're losing him ...
          
          The sound of their voices seems to prompt the POV camera to
          more furious endeavor.
          
          It turns rapidly left and right, forcing its way through the
          greenery until suddenly, with one last push through foliage
          thick enough to be a single bush, the view changes completely.
          
          
          EXT.  FLANDERS FIELD (WW I)   DAY      (JOEY'S DREAM)
          
          The POV camera (Joey) walks out into another battlefield, one
          of a different character.
          
          It appears to be early morning.  The skies are grey and
          overcast.  In the distance plumes of black smoke spiral upward
          
          No jungle, no trees or grass.  The ground is baked mud
          disfigured with deep trenches, re-inforced by wooden slats.
          
          The atmosphere is post-conflict; guns are silent, there are no
          cries or sound of machinery.
          
          Scattered around are corpses of many khaki-clad soldiers.
          
          
                                                                      58
          
          Nothing moves.  No birds sing.  It is a horrible, desolate
          image from the bloody pages of history.  The fields of Flanders
          in World War One.
          
          A noise begins to be heard OFF.  A low angry BUZZING.
          
          ANGLE ON DEAD SOLDIER
          
          A cloud of buzzing flies are feeding on the flesh of his poor
          dead face.
          
                                     JOEY
                                     (off)
                        Noooooooooo .......
          
          The buzzing and Joey's anguished cry both CONTINUE OVER as we
          
          CUT TO
          
          
          INT.   JOEY'S BEDROOM   NIGHT
          
          Joey sitting up in bed, eyes wide, still screaming.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Nooooooooooo!
          
          The cry cuts off abruptly as Joey realizes where she is.
          
          She catches her breath and then freezes as she realizes that
          the buzzing sound from her dream is present in her bedroom.
          Are the flies still feeding?  She glances around her room.
          
          ANGLE ON BEDROOM TV - JOEY'S POV
          
          Her TV set is on.  The buzzing sound comes from white noise.
          
          Joey is puzzled and scared.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Is somebody here?  Is somebody here!?
                        Terri ... ?
          
          She half gets out of bed and then stops, transfixed, as the TV
          screen's white noise is replaced by an image.
          
          ANGLE ON TV
          
          As in the editing suite, the image is grainy black-and-white.
          
          The buzzing continues, now joined by HISSING and WHISTLING that
          fades in and out as if unseen hands are trying to tune into an
          impossibly distant station.
          
          
                                                                      59
          
          Somewhere in the sound-montage we can almost hear GHOSTLY
          VOICES whispering; "Joey, Joey, Joey ... "
          
          On the screen, an English Officer - Elliott - is sitting cross-
          legged on the floor of a Quonset hut.
          
          On the floor in front of him is something at which he stares -
          something that the image is not sharp enough to show.
          
          WIDER ANGLE - JOEY AND TV
          
          Fear vies with fascination in Joey's expression.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What ... What's going on?  What's
                        happening?
          
          ANGLE ON TV
          
          The image disappears in a burst of STATIC which in turn is
          replaced by another image, still monochrome and grainy; A head-
          and-shoulders of Elliott, staring directly out of the screen.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        You have to help me, Joey.
          
          A burst of STATIC and the image disappears completely. The TV
          is obviously not turned on.  The room is silent.
          
          Joey stares at her dead TV in numbed silence.
          
          She falls back into bed, pulling the covers protectively around
          her, staring at the ceiling.
          
          
          INT.   JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT
          
          BLACKNESS
          
          A CLICK is heard OFF and the room is lit, REVEALING JP by the
          door, his finger by the light-switch.  He smiles into the room
          and walks in, looking behind as Terri hesitates by the door.
          
                                     JP
                        Come on in.
          
          Terri moves past him.
          
          JP locks the door with a key he draws from his pocket.
          
          Terri registers this.  JP calms her.
          
          
          
          
                                                                      60
          
                                     JP
                        Not a good neighborhood.  People
                        disappear.  (a beat)  Feel like home?
                        It's just like you left it.
          
          Terri moves into the room, glancing around herself cautiously.
          She registers the pillar.
          
          ANGLE ON PILLAR
          
          It's plainly different from the last time Terri saw it but -
          despite what the audience knows about it - it still seems
          inanimate; a black frozen carving, disturbing but harmless.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Not quite.  This wasn't here.
          
                                     JP
                        No.  But, as you can see, I'm having
                        some work done on it.  You found a real
                        treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can
                        show you how grateful I am.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
          
                                     JP
                        Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it
                        up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
          
                                     TERRI
                        A girl?  Anyone I should know?
          
                                     JP
                        Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're
                        here, it's like she doesn't even exist,
                        you know what I mean?
          
          JP has been cruising the room as they speak.  Now he's standing
          close to the pillar.  Terri is still some distance from him.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Yeah right.  Look ...
          
                                     JP
                        Terri, listen.    (a beat)   Why don't
                        you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's
                        probably ticking away in both our minds,
                        right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it
                        going to happen?  Let's get it out of
                        the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can
                        relax.  Talk.  You know.
          
          
          
                                                                      61
          
          A pause - a tense one for the audience who know that JP has
          obviously decided who Pinhead's next meal is.  Terri looks at
          JP, half suspicious, half attracted.
          
                                     TERRI
                        I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not
                        ready yet.
          
                                     JP
                        Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool.
                        I mean, we've got all night.
          
          JP smiles winningly and warmly.  A nice guy.  A nice smile.  A
          smile a girl can trust.
          
          The pillar stands behind him, its dark inhabitant still and
          silent, waiting for the sacrifice.
          
          
          INT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT
          
          Series of shots (maybe all CROSS-FADED) of kids dancing and
          drinking in the club to establish the passing of time - and to
          highlight the tension of the scene in JP's room by its
          proximity to this (relative) normality.
          
          
          INT.   JP'S PRIVATE ROOM   NIGHT    (MINUTES LATER)
          
          JP lounges against his wall, smoking, close to the pillar.
          
          Terri is sitting on the bed.  She's upset.  She's been telling
          JP about Joey and the phone message.
          
                                     JP
                        That's terrible.  What a bitch.  She was
                        obviously just using you, Terri.  Ready
                        to dump you the second she had what she
                        needed, interfering little whore.
          
                                     TERRI
                        No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's
                        like I must have done something wrong,
                        you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked
                        up something good again.
          
                                     JP
                        Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You
                        know that.  It was my fault, babe, it
                        really was.  And you know I'm sorry.
                        And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I
                        hate to see you in pain like this.
          
          Terri looks up at him, her eyes vulnerable, on the verge of
          tears.  She really wants to believe that he's being a nice guy.
                                                                      62
          
                                     TERRI
                        Really?
          
                                     JP
                        Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to
                        hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's
                        alright.
          
          God, the bastard's good at this.  Terri breaks into small sobs
          and holds her arms out for him.
          
                                     JP
                        No.  No, sweetheart, you come to me.
                        It's not fair.  I come over there.  You
                        know.  We're on the bed.  I just ...
                        'cos you know how much you excite me.
                        God, just looking at you.  You're so
                        beautiful.  I come over there and I'd
                        just want to touch you.  Feel you.  Kiss
                        you.  And that isn't what this is about.
                        C'mon, babe, come to daddy.  Let me make
                        it better.
          
          Terri wipes her eyes, gives a small shy smile and stands up.
          
          She's walking toward JP.  And the pillar.
          
          JP puts a hand out.  He smiles.  Re-assuring.  Loving.
          
          Terri walks.  Vulnerable.  So in need of reassurance and love.
          
          WIDER ANGLE -JP, TERRI, PILLAR
          
          She's getting closer ... closer ... closer ...
          
          CLOSE ANGLE ON JP
          
           - as he blows it.  A sidelong glance at the pillar?  A sudden
          naked hunger in the smiling eyes?  A single bead of sweat?
          Some tiny little thing that takes the lid off his game.
          
          Terri stops dead.  She doesn't know what's happening but
          suddenly this doesn't feel right.
          
                                     TERRI
                        No ... Wait a ...
          
          EVERYTHING ERUPTS!
          
          JP, smiling mask wiped off, leaps at Terri.
          
          Terri flings herself backward, screaming in shock and fear.
          
          Pinhead: suddenly animate and furious; eyes wide open, face
          contorted in frustrated rage, black arms clawing at the air.
                                                                      63
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Bring her to me, boy!
          
          A furious, confused scene of tension and struggle.
          
          JP has hold of Terri, trying to drag her to the monster.
          
          Terri fights back, screaming her disbelief and struggling and
          kicking against him.  They are perilously close to the pillar.
          
          Pinhead is furious - roaring, tearing at the pillar with his
          hands as if trying to physically rip himself. free of it.
          
          Slowly, JP's size and strength is telling; Terri is being
          dragged nearer and nearer to the demon.
          
          At the last possible second - when it seems it's all over, when
          Pinhead's snatching fingers are centimeters from Terri's flesh
          - Terri snatches up a heavy ornament from a shelf by the pillar
          and smashes JP right across the head with it.
          
          JP collapses semi-conscious at the foot of the pillar.
          
          Terri throws herself back from the monster's grabbing arms.
          
          Pinhead snarls in frustration, hands clenched in fists of rage.
          
          WIDER ANGLE
          
          Terri - safely feet away from the pillar - stands, shaking and
          breathless, eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this
          creature from nightmare.
          
          And suddenly Pinhead changes tack; he slides from the roaring
          beast of a moment before to his more usual persona - the glib,
          articulate Black Pope of Hell.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Wait!  Why run?  Where to?  Do you know
                        where you are?
          
                                     TERRI
                        I'm ... I'm ...
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        You're at the door of dreams.  And you
                        can open it.
          
                                     TERRI
                        What are you talking about?
          
          
          
          
          
                                                                      64
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        There are two keys in this room.  On is
                        in the pocket of this fool.  You could
                        take it out without me reaching you. (a
                        beat)  Probably.  And you could use it
                        to let yourself back in to the world you
                        know.  The world you've always known;
                        banal, hopeless, dreamless.
          
          Pinhead, as ever, is hitting the right buttons.  Terri, as we
          know, has dreamed of dreaming.
          
                                     TERRI
                        And ... like ... the other?
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        The other is the key to dreams.  To a
                        world of black miracles and dark wonder.
                        Another life of unknown pleasures.  It's
                        yours.  Complete the pattern.  Solve the
                        puzzle.  Turn the key.
          
          ANGLE ON TERRI
          
           - as she looks at the monster.  And smiles.
          
                                     TERRI
                        Where is it?
          
          Pinhead returns the smile.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        It's lying bleeding at your feet.
          
          JP is on the floor, semi-conscious, bleeding from the head.
          
                                     JP
                               (delerious. Ad-lib)
                        Unhhh ... Terri ... what ... no ...
          
          Terri edges around the pillar to grasp one of JP's limp arms.
          
          INTERCUT CLOSE-UPS OF PINHEAD AND TERRI
          
           - as the bond between tempter and tempted is strengthened.
          
          Terri holds JP's arm out ...
          
          Pinhead stretches his own arm forward ...
          
          And JP finally - for one brief second of terrifying clarity -
          realizes what's happening.
          
          
          
                                                                      65
          
                                     JP
                                (screaming)
                        No! Terri! Please! I didn't mean to..!!
          
          Too late.  Pinhead's hand closes around his wrist.
          
          Terri leaps back out of harm's way.
          
          Pinhead - with awesome strength - yanks JP up to his feet and
          pulls him close.  He stares into the terrified face of JP.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        I have such sights to show you.
          
          JP is sucked dry by Pinhead.
          
          And Terri watches, her face perversely excited by this - the
          first of the dark miracles that the monster had promised.
          
          MAJOR F/X SEQUENCE
          
           - as the transformation of pillar into Pinhead is completed.
          
          WIDER ANGLE
          
          Pinhead, fully-fleshed and incarnate, stands in the room.  At
          his feet are the dry husk that was JP and the steaming, hissing
          remnants of the pillar like a pool of black toxic oil.
          
          He turns and looks at Terri.  Slowly, elegantly, he walks
          toward her.
          
          Terri backs away across the room.  But she backs off slowly,
          sensuously, like an eager but nervous virgin bride ready for
          her groom.
          
          Camera moves in CLOSE on her glowing eyes and excited face.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on the Box.  A cloud of dust spirals out into the room in
          a reverse action of the dust in the antiques store.
          
          
          INT.   JOEY'S BEDROOM   NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on Joey's sleeping face.  REM shows beneath her eyelids
          and she murmurs in her sleep.
          
          Very faintly OFF is the sound of distant music.
          
          Joey's eyes snap open and glance from side to side.  She sits
          up in bed and registers the music, which seems to have grown in
          volume on her waking.
                                                                      66
          
          It is strange, old-fashioned music;  A palm-court string
          orchestra playing a sentimental waltz tune reminiscent of the
          1920's or earlier.
          
          Joey looks around the room.
          
          There is no-one in the room.
          
          The TV set is still dead.
          
          But ... the bedroom door is open a crack and a very strange DIM
          ORANGE LIGHT is creeping in from the main room.  And that seems
          to be from where the music is coming.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - as she gets out of bed.
          
          She's cautious and careful, moving slowly and quietly as she
          wraps a robe around herself and moves to the door.
          
          The music continues to play.
          
          She opens the door slowly and walks through.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          This room too is empty.
          
          The music is louder and the soft warm pulse of the orange light
          is more distinct, bathing the walls and the furniture.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES - JOEY'S POV
          
           - as Joey tries to locate the source of the music and the
          light;
          
          The sofa.
          
          The bookshelfs.
          
          The TV - with the still and inactive Box.
          
          The closed drapes over the big picture window.
          
          Finally -
          
          ANGLE ON CLOSET DOOR
          
          Both the music and the light seem to be centered on the closet
          door across the room.  They're both coming from behind it.
          
          Joey approaches the closet, still tense, still careful.  She
          opens the closet door and looks in.
                                                                      67
          
          The closet is where Joey has stored her past.  But she's stored
          it neatly.
          
          Boxed and piled on shelves are old magazines, old greetings
          cards, old photographs, old soft-toys, college diplomas,
          clippings from small-town newspapers ("Death of a Local Hero:
          Tommy Summerskill lost in Vietnam", "Joanne Summerskill Class
          Valedictorian: looks to career in Media") etc etc.
          
          Also in there, stuffed away at the top of the closet, is an old
          radio - a big old wood-and-wire-grille valve driven beauty from
          which the lilting music is coming.
          
          At some stage in its life, part of its casing was smashed away
          and the pulsing orange light is its flickering vacuum tubes.
          
          It's an old mains-powered model and its mains cord dangles off
          the shelf of the closet.  This radio isn't plugged into
          anything except the paranormal.
          
          CLOSE on Joey; staring at this broadcast from the beyond.
          
                                     JOEY
                        How .... ?
          
          Joey reaches up and brings the radio down from the shelf and
          out into the main room.  She sets it down on the coffee table
          in front of the sofa.
          
          DIFFERENT ANGLE
          
          Formal, classical framing from a low angle - Joey and radio in
          foreground, big picture window and its closed drapes in the
          background.
          
          Joey kneels up in front of the table.
          
          She stares at the radio with the same kind of trapped
          fascination with which we have seen characters in the previous
          HELLRAISER movies stare at the Box.
          
          Her fingers are drawn to the tuning dial as if to a puzzle.
          She plays with the dial, moving through various "stations".
          
          Joey's face is open with expectation as she moves through them,
          as if she is waiting for clues.  Or instructions.
          
          The music gives way to various VOICES;
          
          An Indian voice giving some kind of commentary.  The English
          words "BBC" and "World Service" are heard amidst the punjabi.
          
          (Joey turns the dial)
          
          A tired sad English voice;
                                                                      68
          
                                     ENGLISH VOICE
                               ... and the King has sent a
                        personal message of sympathy to the
                        parents of those brave men who ...
          
          (Joey turns the dial)
          
          A resonant French voice;
          
                                     FRENCH VOICE
                        L'Oiseau chante avec ses doigts.  Deux
                        fois.
          
          (Joey turns the dial)
          
          Another burst of music, this time more raucous and syncopated.
          A ragtime tune from the birth of Jazz.
          
          (Joey turns the dial)
          
          Dead Air.  An ominous pause.  And Elliott's voice.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Joey.  Look out your window.
          
          Joey shrinks back in nervous shock at this direct address.
          
          The radio goes dead.  The tubes stop glowing.  The room is now
          a dimly-lit place of shadow and suspense.
          
          Joey glances back over her shoulder at her closed drapes and
          then at the silent radio.
          
          She stands up slowly and crosses to the drapes.  The camera
          rises and TRACKS in as she walks, framing those drapes like
          curtains in a theater.
          
          With one strong gesture, Joey sweeps the drapes open.  And
          gasps.
          
          Instead of neighboring roof-tops and a view of the city, Joey
          is looking directly into the interior of a Quonset hut.
          
          It is the image from her TV set though full-size, full-color,
          and apparently real.
          
          At the far end, Elliott sits cross-legged on the floor.  In
          front of him on the floor is the puzzle box.
          
          Elsewhere in the hut; A camp-bed on which lie a gun-belt and an
          Officer's peaked cap.  And an old-fashioned radio - the same
          radio that is still in Joey's room.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
                                                                      69
          
           - as she stares beyond her window into this impossible scene.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Tell me ... Tell me ... Hello?
          
          CLOSER on the elements in the hut, as we (and Joey) realize
          that everything in there is frozen in time.  There is no
          movement, no sound.
          
          Wonderingly (but carefully) Joey stretches her arm out before
          her.  When her arm reaches the threshold of the Quonset hut, it
          disappears into the space once occupied by window glass.
          
          She pulls her arm back sharply with an intake of breath.  Maybe
          she even takes a half-step backward.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I'm seven floors up ... I'm seven floors
                        up! I can't ...
          
          But she can.
          
          She summons her courage, steps over the sill, and walks into
          the impossible.
          
          
          INT.   QUONSET HUT
          
          We are looking at a solid wall.  Then, through the wall, Joey
          walks into the Hut, still bewilderment by the sights around
          her.
          
          Still the image does not move.  Everything is very real, very
          present.  But frozen.
          
          Joey approaches the immobile Elliott and looks from him to the
          box and back again.
          
          (NB: Joey's speeches to the frozen Elliott are bravado; her
          face and body language betray her awed nervousness at the
          bizarre situation in which she finds herself.)
          
                                     JOEY
                        Now what?  I'm here.  Now what?  I just
                        walked into madness for you.  Talk!
          
          Joey looks back behind her.
          
          ANGLE ON HUT WALL - JOEY'S POV
          
          There is no window back into the apartment, just a fourth wall.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY AND ELLIOTT
          
          
                                                                      70
          
                                     JOEY
                        Great.  That's just great!  You bring me
                        here.  You freeze up on me.  And now
                        there's no way out.  I've had dates like
                        you before.  I ...
          
          A CREAK is heard OFF.  Joey looks up.
          
          JOEY'S POV
          
          At the far end of the Quonset Hut, behind Elliott, a door has
          creaked open an inch or two.
          
          Joey looks from the door back to the frozen Elliott.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Thanks.  I think.
          
          Joey crosses to the door and opens it.  She walks through.
          
          
          EXT.   FLANDERS FIELD   DAY
          
          Joey walks out onto the World War One battlefield of her most
          recent dream.  She stands there - an incongruous vulnerable
          figure in her nightdress and robe - amidst the corpses, the
          trenches, and the distant plumes of smoke.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What's going on?  Is this a dream?
          
          She glances back at the door of the hut she has just left.
          
          JOEY'S POV - THROUGH HUT DOOR
          
          Within the hut, the frozen Elliott still sits.
          
          ANGLE ON JOEY
          
           - as she turns from looking into the hut and gasps, her eyes
          wide in shock.
          
          Standing on a hillock, framed against the grey battlefield
          skies, is Elliott.
          
          Joey walks toward him.
          
          Elliott stands calmly and smiles at Joey.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Joey.  How kind of you to come.
          
          A beat.  Joey (and the audience) take in Elliott's impossible
          presence, as she and he stand amidst the corpse-strewn field.
          
                                                                      71
          
                                     JOEY
                        Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help
                        me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming
                        this?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        You have to help me.  You will
                        understand.  And no, you're not
                        dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
          
                                     JOEY
                        It's ... I don't know.  First World War,
                        right?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Correct.  The fields of France.  And
                        many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me.
                        My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser.
                        Captain.
          
          He extends his hand.
          
          Joey - slowly and nervously - puts her hand out to shake his.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Joey Summerskill.
          
          Elliott smiles understandingly as he releases her hand.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably
                        never shaken hands with a ghost before,
                        am I right?
          
                                     JOEY
                        Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What
                        the Hell is going on?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Hell is precisely what is going on,
                        Joey.  And we have to stop it.  I
                        because of a special obligation, you
                        because you're the only person who can
                        help. And because you know what is
                        right, and just, and true.  Will you
                        walk with me a while?
          
          He gestures with his hand and they begin to walk.
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
                                                                      72
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        There were days in this war, days right
                        on top of each other, when the newly
                        dead were numbered in the tens of
                        thousands.  They called it the war to
                        end all wars.  Though it didn't.  You
                        know that.  There were more wars.  More
                        dead.  Your father's war.  Your dream
                        search for your father led you here.  To
                        me.  Joey, we need to talk.
          
          Elliott does nothing dramatic - he doesn't clap his hands or
          snap his fingers - but somehow, magically, he and Joey, without
          moving or changing position are back in the Quonset hut.
          
          
          INT.   QUONSET HUT
          
          The frozen Elliott is still sitting on the floor before the
          box.  The mobile Elliott gestures at his frozen self as he
          speaks to the bemused Joey.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        The war pulled poetry out of some of us.
                        Others it affected differently.  This is
                        me a few years later.  We're in India,
                        by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like
                        many survivors. Lost souls with nothing
                        left to believe in but gratification.
                        We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many
                        dead.  For us God, too, fell at
                        Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And
                        if we mourned, we mourned in silence.
                        Thousands drank themselves to death.
                        Others went further.  I went further.  I
                        thought I was a lost soul.  But, until
                        this frozen moment, I didn't even know
                        what the phrase meant.
          
                                     JOEY
                        And what is ... this frozen moment?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I
                        am, what I will be ... past, present,
                        future, all bound here at this timeless
                        moment of decision.  I was an explorer
                        of forbidden vices and pleasures.
                        Opening the Box was my final act of
                        exploration, of discovery.
          
                                     JOEY
                        And what did you discover?
          
          
                                                                      73
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Something bad.
          
                                     JOEY
                        And why are you back?  Why are we here?
          
          Again, no signal from Elliott but the background changes
          magically once more;
          
          
          EXT.   FLANDERS FIELD   DAY
          
          Elliott is once again framed dramatically on the hillock, Joey
          standing close.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Because something worse is coming.
          
                                     (a beat)
          
                        I opened the Box, Joey.  I found the
                        monster within it.  And it found the
                        monster within me.  For decades I served
                        Hell with no memory of my former life
                        until a friend released me.  You saw
                        her.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your
                        soul was freed, why are you back?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Because - monster as I was - I was bound
                        by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box
                        had to be opened to let me out.  The
                        truly innocent were safe.  That's no
                        longer true.  The shell of the beast has
                        been fleshed.  What I was is out there,
                        Joey.  In your world.  Unbound.
                        Unstoppable.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What will he do?  What does he want?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        He'll do what he does best.  But he'll
                        do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the
                        Earth forever, indulging his taste for
                        all the myriad subtleties of human
                        suffering.
          
                                     JOEY
                        What can we do?
          
          
                                                                      74
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right
                        questions.  There is something we can do
                        but it will require great courage.
          
                                     JOEY
                        I don't know ...
          
          Elliott reaches out and strokes her cheek.  Gently.  Lovingly.
          We see in Joey's eyes that there is a response there.  A
          response beyond the comradely.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Joey, you walked through your window
                        from one reality to another.  You're
                        stronger than you think.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Then tell me what to do.
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        This is his first night on Earth.  He
                        wants to close the door behind him.
                        Like all Lieutenants, he covets command.
                        There's a gateway to Hell through which
                        he can be taken back.  He has to destroy
                        it.
          
                                     JOEY
                        So where is it?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Your apartment.
          
          Joey gasps.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Wha .... ?
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
          
          
          INT.   UNDER THE UNDERGROUND   NIGHT
          
          Lights flash.  Music pounds.  Kids dance.  It's a wild night at
          Under The Underground and it's about to get wilder.
          
          The source music (thrash metal) builds and builds, as if
          heading for a climax.  And then the climax comes.
          
          ANGLE ON DOOR TO JP'S ROOM
          
          
          
                                                                      75
          
          The door BLASTS open explosively from within.  The pieces of
          the shattered door FLY across the dance-floor, accompanied by
          chunks of plaster and brick from the door-surround.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES (QUICK CUTS)
          
          Flying wood and masonry hit people.
          
          One chunk SMASHES into the DJ console, bringing the music to a
          scratching, screeching end.
          
          Various SCREAMS are heard OFF through the ensuing silence.
          
          In the confusion, kids scramble for the main doorway.  Is it a
          bomb?  Is it a street-gang attack?
          
          The Main Doorway SLAMS supernaturally shut, bolts flying into
          place untouched by human (or inhuman) hand.
          
          Confused and frightened faces turn back to look at the source
          of the explosion.
          
          ANGLE ON DOORWAY TO JP'S ROOM
          
          Lit from behind by blinding beams of BLUE LIGHT, Pinhead
          emerges through the doorway.  Slow.  Elegant.  Terrifying.
          
          Pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and awe-
          struck crowd look back at him.
          
          For the most part, the crowd are stunned into silence but there
          are a few murmurs from them;
          
                                     CROWD
                               (ad-lib)
                        Oh My God ...
          
                        Jesus Christ!
          
                        What the FUCK ... ?!
          
                        No no no no no no no ....
          
          Pinhead scans the club.
          
          He looks at the terrified humans.  The cruelly beautiful
          artworks.  The humans.  The artworks.  The humans.  The
          artworks.
          
          A small smile forms on his face.  He's just had an entertaining
          idea.
          
          
          
          
                                                                      76
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          The view through the big picture window is entirely normal
          again; the cityscape by night.
          
          Suddenly, Joey seems to appear behind the glass - translucent,
          like a reflection - and comes through the window into her
          apartment, "solidifying" as she steps in.
          
          Her hands are at her head and she staggers forward a few steps.
          It's as if the enormity of her trip thru realities has just hit
          her.  She falls forward onto the floor of her room, unconscious.
          
          FADE OUT
          
          FADE IN
          
           - as the ringing of a phone grows in volume.
          
          Joey raises her head, bleary-eyed, and glances round the room
          trying to locate the source of the noise that has woken her.
          
          She crawls the few feet to the phone and snatches at it.  The
          hand-set falls and she has to gather it up from the floor.
          Maneuvering herself into a sitting position, she speaks.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Hello?

                        Doc?  ...  Doc ... Hello?
          
          She puts the phone down and rushes across to turn on the TV.
          
          
          TV IMAGE/DOC'S SHOULDERCAM:
          
          
          EXT.   CITY STREETS, OUTSIDE CLUB   NIGHT
          
          The images are confusing, with the rapid pans and temporary
          loss of focus or light that characterise raw news footage.
          
          Doc's Camera weaves amongst a mass of uniformed people, trying
          to catch clear pictures of-what's been happening.
          
          Sirens howl, red emergency lights flash.
          
          
                                                                      77
          
          It becomes clear we are looking at the aftermath of a disaster.
          Or a massacre.
          
          The club building looks like a bomb hit it.  Smoke and debris
          litter the street.  So do corpses.
          
          Some of the dead bodies are simply dead bodies.  Others -
          glimpsed fleetingly and tantalizingly as Doc is jostled and
          bustled - seem to be mutilated decoratively.  In fact they bear
          hideous similarities to the artworks that used to grace the
          club: armless torsos wrapped in barbed wire; flayed limbs with
          machinery inside instead of muscle.

          Suddenly, the images are blocked by a very BURLY COP pushing at
          the camera and talking directly into it.

          seeing.    (INTERCUT with Doc's footage)

          BACK ON TV SCREEN
          
          Doc's camera pans around the area, past rubbernecking crowds,
          past shadowed alleys, past Police cars and ambulances vehicles
          ... and then whips back to an alley in the distance.

                        I thought ... what's ... I think there's
                        something up there ...
          
          Joey's eyes widen in horror as she speaks uselessly to the
          screen.
          
          
                                                                      78

          EXT.   ALLEYWAY   NIGHT    BACK ON TV SCREEN
          
          The hubbub and noise has died away.  Doc's camera is advancing
          up a very dimly-lit alley.  Hardly any detail can be seen.  The
          camera creeps forward ... forward ... forward ...
          
          Then suddenly a barely-glimpsed movement very close to the side
          and the camera swings wildly toward it.

                        Shit!  What was ...
          
          The face of Pinhead, almost lost to the darkness of the alley,
          is glimpsed on the screen as it looms toward the lens.
          
          The image disappears to darkness, over which Doc's SCREAM of
          mortal terror and agony can be heard before the blackness is
          suddenly replaced by a station identification card and then a
          very harried anchorperson at a studio desk.

                        Well, we've ... er ... yes, we've
                        temporarily lost our pictures there and
                        ... and ...
          
          Joey has her hands at her mouth in horror.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Doc!  DOC!!
          
          Joey leaps to her feet, grabs the box from the TV, and stares
          at it in her hand.

          Joey's hands grip her steering-wheel tightly.  Her face is
          drawn and grim.  The Box is on the seat beside her. She is
          driving very fast.
          
          She has to slam on the brakes at a red light.  She pounds at
          the dashboard in frustration.

          EXT.   THE STREETS OF THE CITY   NIGHT
          
          CLOSE on a terrified face.
          
          The face belongs to EDDIE, a 20 year old runner for a drug
          gang.  His head is pressed tight against a brick wall.  His
          nose is bleeding and his eye is red and ready to bruise.
          
                                     EDDIE
                        I'll get it!  I promise!  I'll ...
          
          A fist slams into Eddie's face.
          
          WIDER ANGLE REVEALS -
          
          An alley.  Eddie is being held against the wall by two
          uniformed COPS, one in his 40's, one in his 20's.  The elder
          cop has just punched Eddie in the face.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                        Don't promise me shit, you little fuck!
                        You know what your promise is worth to
                        me?  Huh?  Fifty per cent of fuck-all!
          
                                     YOUNGER COP
                        Give him the money, Eddie.
          
                                     EDDIE
                        I don't ...
          
          A big back-handed slap from the Elder Cop.
          
                                     YOUNGER COP
                        Give him the money, Eddie.
          
                                     EDDIE
                        Just listen to me, Please!  I ...
          
          The Elder Cop gut-punches him and Eddie doubles up.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                        I'm done listening, shit-brain!  Where
                        you been all day?  They shut the school?
                        Kindergarten closed?  No customers?
                        Huh?  Huh?
          
                                     YOUNGER COP
                        Give him the money, Eddie.  Tell ya, I'm
                        gonna puke if he beats on you any more.
                        Just give him the ...
          
          The Younger Cop pauses, looking beyond them down the alley as a
          long black shadow falls over them.
          
          
                                                                      80
          
                                     YOUNGER COP
                        ... money.  What the ... ?
          
          The Elder Cop, at the change in his partner's tone, looks up.
          
          Standing in the center of the alley at its far end, light
          coming from behind him so that he is unclear, is Pinhead.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                               (Calm. Expecting obedience)
                        You, fuckoff.
          
          He turns back to Eddie.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                        Get your head outta your stinkin' ass
                        and look at me, boy.
          
                                     YOUNGER COP
                               (still looking down alley)
                        Hey ...
          
          Pinhead is moving up the alley towards the action.
          
          Elder Cop shoves Eddie away.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                               (to Eddie)
                        Get lost.
          
          Eddie doesn't waste time with questions.  He's gone.
          
          The Cops straighten up and start walking to meet Pinhead.
          
          Pinhead advances- still in the shadows, still just a black
          shape moving forward.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                        I have the distinct impression I told
                        you to fuckoff.  Unless I miss my guess,
                        you've just disobeyed an officer of the
                        law.
          
          Pinhead emerges into the (dim) light in the alley.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        I am the Law.
          
          Cops halt in shock at this awesome presence, both of them
          instinctively drawing their guns.  And both instinctively
          beginning to back up.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                        You're one butt-ugly son of a bitch and
                        you're about to dead meat.
                                                                      81
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        I am the son of eternal night and you
                        are about to discover pain has no
                        ending.
          
          Well, that's enough of a direct threat for any officer of the
          law.  Both cops fire their guns.  Once.  Twice.  Three times.
          
          Pinhead keeps walking.  He spits out the bullets that his body
          has absorbed.
          
                                     YOUNGER COP
                        Oh shh ...
          
          They empty their guns - useless - and then they turn and run
          down the alley.  And then stop short.  There is a sudden wall
          of impenetrable blackness in front of them as if the world
          simply comes to a stop four yards from their feet.
          
          The cops turn, terrified, to look back.  Instinctively, they
          spread apart - each walking near to opposite walls.
          
          The younger cop is standing beneath a fire escape.  He glances
          up as if he might be able to jump up to safety.  No.  Too high.
          
          Pinhead's head flicks upward as if in a gesture of command.
          
          Suddenly, the Fire escape ladder zooms downward with impossible
          speed and force.
          
          The Younger Cop doesn't even have time to scream.  The ladder
          smashes right through his body, impaling him.
          
          His corpse stands there twitching and shuddering, wrapped
          around the ladder.
          
          Elder Cop stares in terror at his partner's fate.
          
                                     ELDER COP
                        No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.
          
          Pinhead stands very still and speaks very calmly.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Curb your tongue.
          
          The Elder Cop's body starts to move involuntarily.  His
          movements are jerky and spasmodic as if his mind is trying to
          fight what his body is trying to do.
          
          Pinhead's head moves through various positions.  His face is
          calm, showing no particular pleasure at what he is doing but
          only a fascinated concentration as if experimenting with new-
          found skills.
          
                                                                      82
          
          The Elder Copts shaking puppet-like hands draw his handcuffs
          from his belt.
          
          His eyes show terror.  Everything else is beyond his control.
          
          He raises the cuffs to head level and springs one of them open.
          
          His mouth suddenly jerks open and his tongue protrudes.
          
          The fear in his eyes increases.
          
          He moves the open cuff over his tongue.  He's making panicked
          moaning noises as if trying to scream.
          
          SLAM!  He drives the cuff closed right through his tongue!
          
          And SCREAMS (as best he can).
          
          Pinhead looks beyond the Cop to the wall of blackness and makes
          another commanding gesture with his head.
          
          A Chain flies from the darkness and wraps itself around the
          other cuff.
          
          The chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the
          darkness, hauling the Cop off his feet and dragging him along
          the alley into the blackness.
          
          The Cop screams and moans all the way until he is enveloped
          into the darkness and then the sounds suddenly stop dead.
          
          
          EXT.   CITY STREETS, NEAR CLUB   NIGHT
          
          A Paramedic is attempting to hold Joey back.  In the distance
          behind them is the wreckage of the club.  They are standing
          near the alley into which Doc's camera disappeared.
          
                                     JOEY
                        But I have to see him!  I'm his friend!
          
                                     PARAMEDIC
                        Lady, trust me!  You really don't want
                        to go ...
          
          But Joey has slipped past his obstructing arm and runs on into
          the alley.
          
          And pulls to a horrified stop.
          
                                     JOEY
                        No!  NO!!
          
          REVERSE ANGLE - JOEY'S POV

          The scene is well-lit by Police emergency lights.  It is taped
          off by yellow DO NOT CROSS banners.  Paramedics and cops stand
          around in various states of shock or disgust.
          
          In the middle of it all is Doc.  Quite dead.
          
          The body is kneeling up, its cold hands resting on its lap and
          holding its severed head which stares up at its shoulders.  The
          camera has been shoved deep between the corpse's shoulder
          blades and is angled down as if filming its dead face.
          
          CLOSE on Joey's devastated face.
          
          
          EXT.   INNER-CITY CHURCH   NIGHT
          
          An establishing shot of a church at the top of a small hill.
          
          
          INT.   INNER-CITY CHURCH   NIGHT
          
          The Church is in semi-darkness.  Some candles at an offertory,
          some others on an altar, provide the only light.
          
          On the very front pew a PRIEST sits, head bent low in prayer.
          
          The Priest is a young man.  Probably a good man.  We're not
          really going to have the time to find out.
          
          A shadow seems to pass over the Priest's bowed head.
          
          At first, it seems he hasn't noticed.  Then he looks up, a
          little puzzled.  He looks to his right, his left, then shifts
          in the pew to look back along the central aisle.
          
          There are rows and rows of empty pews and, in the distance, the
          Church door ... which is ajar.
          
          The Priest stands, walks to the start of the aisle, and looks
          back along it again.
          
                                     PRIEST
                               (calling down aisle)
                        Is there anyone there?  Hello?
          
          Silence.  A beat.
          
          The Priest looks puzzled.  We see his mind work.  He's looked
          right, looked left, looked down ... How about ...?
          
          He turns right round to face the altar.
          
          PRIEST'S POV
          
          
                                                                      84
          
          To the Priest, it's an image of nightmarish blasphemy.  Even to
          us heathens, it's pretty shocking;
          
          Pinhead in all his dark glory is standing behind the altar.
          
                                     PRIEST
                        How dare you!
          
          It gets worse.  Pinhead, staring at the Priest all the while,
          reaches his hand to the back of his head and begins to extract
          one of the pins from his skull.
          
          The pin is horribly long and, sickeningly, the last few inches
          aren't metal at all but some kind of infernal worm - dark,
          slimy, and befanged.
          
          Pinhead presses the worm against his palm and it instantly
          burrows through his flesh pulling its pin-tail behind it.  He
          repeats the operation with the other palm.
          
          He turns his palms out to show the Priest in a blasphemous
          parody of Christ's stigmata.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        I am the Way.
          
          The Priest rushes up to the altar to Pinhead.
          
                                     PRIEST
                        You'll burn in Hell for this!
          
          The Priest reaches him.  Pinhead's hand is on his throat
          instantly, squeezing silence from him.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Burn?  What a limited imagination.
          
          The choking Priest kicks and struggles as Pinhead forces him to
          his knees before him.
          
          Pinhead towers over the Priest.  He smiles.
          
          With his free hand he gouges out a piece of his own flesh from
          the decorative wounds on his chest.  He holds the bloody piece
          of meat up.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        This is my body.  This is my blood.
                        Happy are they who come to my supper.
          
          Pinhead shoves the disgusting lump of blue and bloody flesh
          into the Priest's aghast mouth.
          
          Pinhead flings the priest away from him.
          
                                                                      85
          
          The Priest lands heavily on the floor.
          
          Pinhead walks forward, smashing the altar aside.
          
          All the candles flicker as if an unheard wind is blowing
          through the Church.
          
          Pinhead walks up the aisle toward the semi-conscious Priest.
          
          And all the candles go out.
          
          BLACKNESS
          
          
          INT/EXT   JOEY'S CAR/CITY STREETS   NIGHT
          
          Joey is driving again.  And this time she's not even stopping
          at red lights.  She steams across junctions, leaving cars
          swerving and horns honking in her wake.
          
          Something catches her eye and she throws a glance to her side.
          
                                     JOEY
                               (appalled)
                        Oh God ...
          
          JOEY'S (MOVING) POV
          
          Up a side street, atop a hill, is the Inner-city Church.  It's
          on fire.
          
          Joey swings the car up the hill.
          
          SMASH-CUT TO:
          
          Joey getting out of the car nearer the burning church.  Off to
          her side is a smaller building, the Church Hall.
          
          Joey shakes her head at the desecration.  She has no doubt
          who's responsible.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Having fun en route, you bastard.
          
          Suddenly, a CREAKING noise from behind her.
          
          Joey freezes in terror then slowly - very slowly - turns round.
          
          JOEY'S POV - SHOCK REVEAL
          
          The Priest - now mercifully dead - is crucified against the
          side wall of the smaller building.  Pinhead's nails protrude
          from his palms and his ankles.
          
          
                                                                      86
          
          EXT   CITY STREETS   NIGHT
          
          A SERIES of QUICK CUTS of Joey's car tearing through the
          darkness heading back to her apartment.
          
          
          INT.   CORRIDOR, JOEY'S APT. BLDG.   NIGHT
          
          Joey rushes down the corridor to her apartment door, hurriedly
          turns the lock and rushes in.
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          Joey closes her door and switches on the light.  The mood is
          suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town.  It's
          very still, very slow, very quiet.
          
          Perhaps it's too quiet:  Joey moves into the room slowly,
          clutching the Box in her hands and glancing round.  Her manner
          makes the mood suddenly creepy.  Is the monster already in the
          house?
          
          Very slowly, very carefully, Joey begins to move round her
          apartment.  Hardly breathing, making no sudden movements, she
          checks her doors.  The kitchen ... empty.  The bedroom ...
          empty.  The bathroom ... empty.
          
          Joey stands back in the center of her main room, facing out to
          her big picture window.  Slowly, she lets out a big breath and
          then draws an equally slow one in.  Maybe it's alright ...
          maybe the monster isn't here ... maybe ...
          
          Magically, eerily, slowly, the Box begins to rise from Joey's
          hand.  Her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Oh shit ...
          
          Maybe there's one place she hasn't checked.  Swallowing
          nervously, Joey tilts her head up and back, her eyes rising up
          in their sockets.
          
          The camera tilts low ... low ... lower ... taking in a wider
          view of the room and its ceiling and the ascending Box ...
          
          And the audience screams!
          
          Like a spider or a lizard, Pinhead is flat against the ceiling,
          arms stretched out for balance, his face staring down at Joey.
          
          Joey throws her hands to her mouth and screams.
          
          
          
                                                                      87
          
          Pinhead, angling down feet first, floats elegantly to the floor
          to stand facing Joey.  The Box lands in one of his outstretched
          hands.  He holds it out to show Joey ... and then suddenly
          closes his powerful hand on it, apparently crushing it.
          
          He flings the remnants from him and they land on Joey's floor -
          Chunks and splinters of wood, whirring and spinning machinery
          of gold and silver, and scores of tiny writhing worms.
          
                                     JOEY
                        No!
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Watch.
          
          Thanks to the miracles of trick photography, the remnants
          suddenly come back together and reassemble themselves into the
          Box which sits there intact on the floor.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        The Box can't be destroyed.  Like pain
                        or the poor, it is always with us.  But
                        as long as I have it, no-one can open
                        it.  Now come here and die.  You have
                        friends in Hell waiting to greet you.
          
          Joey begins to back across the room toward her window.
          
                                     JOEY
                        You'll have to come and get me, you ugly
                        bastard.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Spirited.  Good.  I'll enjoy making you
                        bleed.  I'll enjoy making you enjoy it.
          
          Pinhead starts across the room.
          
          Joey looks at her window.  It's the normal view ... with the
          normal seven-story drop.
          
          Pinhead closes.
          
          She bites her lip, goes for it: in a literal and metaphorical
          leap of faith she runs headlong at the window and jumps at it.
          
          The window shatters.
          
          Pinhead's arm reaches out after Joey as if to grab her and pull
          her back.
          
          SIDELONG ANGLE
          
          
          
                                                                      88
          
           - shows his arm entering the shattered window and also shows
          the night-time cityscape beyond the window.  What it doesn't
          show is the front of the monster's arm.  That's somewhere else.
          
          CUT TO
          
          
          INT.   QUONSET HUT
          
          CLOSE on Pinhead's arm, still clutching at the air.
          
          Suddenly, a khaki-uniformed arm moves into shot and grasps
          Pinhead's hand, arm-wrestling style.
          
          WIDER ANGLE (WITH OPTICAL F/X)
          
          Elliott literally pulls Pinhead through from one reality to
          another - we see parts of the monster appearing and
          disappearing in front of the Hut wall as if glimpsed through
          tears in reality.  It's like a tug-of-war which Elliott wins -
          Suddenly Pinhead's there on the floor of the Quonset hut.
          
          And his other self - Elliott - still has hold of his hand.
          
          Pinhead throws a glance around the Hut.  He recognizes it ...
          and the frozen figure at the top end perched before the Box.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                               (furious rage)
                        Aahhhh!!!
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Joey!  Back to the wall, quickly!
          
          Joey runs around then to the far wall - just in time because
          now the pyrotechnics start.
          
          Elliott tightens his grip and (with a nice series of INTERCUT
          CLOSE-UPS of these two alternative selves) the life-forces of
          Elliott and Pinhead begin to erupt.
          
          ELECTRIC BLUE LIGHT begins to play over both their bodies.
          It's apparently agonizing, both figures arching with the pain,
          both faces grimacing.
          
          Joey watches, wincing in sympathetic agony.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Elliott!  No!  What about you?!  Where
                        will you be?!
          
          Elliott grunts his answer through the agony.
          
          
          
                                                                      89
          
                                     ELLIOTT
                        Back with the damned.  No more hope of
                        heaven.  But I drag this monster back
                        with me!
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        You stupid interfering foo ... AAAAAH!
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES ON THE THREE SELVES - PINHEAD, ELLIOTT, AND THE
          SEATED OFFICER
          
          The essences of Pinhead and Elliott - drawn from their bodies
          as sweeping, glowing, spitting arcs of BLUE LIGHT - crackle in
          the air of the Hut like a miniature electrical storm ...
          
          Until they suddenly lock together in one more powerful arc
          which flies at the body of the seated Officer and disappears
          inside him in a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.
          
          And suddenly, as vision returns, there is only the seated
          officer   (and, at the far end of the room, Joey).
          
          And, almost as suddenly, the frozen scene comes to life;
          
          The radio near the camp bed is playing.
          
          A bead of sweat falls down the Officer's face as he reaches
          forward to pick up the Box.
          
          The Officer, apparently completely unaware of Joey's presence,
          begins to work the Box.
          
          As the process works through, we INTERCUT CONSTANTLY BETWEEN
          
          1)  The Officer's hands and the movements of the Box here in
          the Hut in 1921.
          
          2)  EXACTLY MATCHING movements of the Box back on the floor of
          Joey's apartment in 1992.  Moving on its own, linked across the
          years to its earlier self.
          
          3)  Joey watching the movements in the Hut.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Elliott? ... Elliott? ... You can't
                        hear me, can you?  It's 1921.  I'm not
                        really here ...
          
          Suddenly, small patterns of BLUE LIGHT arc across the Box,
          shocking the Officer who drops the Box and then stares in shock
          and fascination as ...
          
          On the floor, the box begins to open.
          
          The Officer kneels up and leans over the Box ...
                                                                      90
          
          And the chains fly!  Shooting up from within and hooking
          themselves cruelly into the Officer's face and chest.
          
          CLOSE ON the Officer's face, howling in agony.
          
          CLOSE ON Joey's face, sobbing in distress.  She throws up her
          hands to hide the unbearable sight from herself and, when she
          lowers them, ...
          
          
          INT.   MAIN ROOM, JOEY'S APT.   NIGHT
          
          .. she's back in her room. Alone.  Window intact.  Normal view.
          
          Joey stares around, her face a mix of sadness and relief.
          
          The mood now is very down, post-cataclysmic, post-adventure.
          
          Joey takes a deep slow breath and crosses the room toward the
          kitchen door.
          
          She crosses the floor without glancing down at it.  Why should
          she?  Everything's over.  But we notice, even if she doesn't,
          that the Box is no longer there.  But we hardly have time to
          register this before ...
          
          Joey opens the kitchen door.
          
                                     JOEY
                        (SCREAMS!!!!)
          
          Pinhead is framed in the doorway.
          
          Behind him, instead of her kitchen, is the black space of Hell
          - like the Torture Rooms in HELLRAISER and HELLBOUND, it is
          full of shadowy pillars and chains.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Oh, no kiss of welcome after 70 years?
          
          Joey backs away, shaking her head in shocked denial.
          
          Pinhead moves forward, very leisurely.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        This will be so good, Joey.  You loved
                        him, didn't you?  I can feel him inside,
                        weeping for you.  He can watch through
                        the centuries as we discover the things
                        that make you whimper.
          
          Joey's mood breaks and she turns and rushes for her front door.
          
          She reaches it, throws it open ... and screams.
          
                                                                      91
          
          JP Monroe is in the doorway - but he's only just recognizable.
          He's now a CENOBITE - blue-skinned, scarred, mutilated, and
          decorated with metal and leather.
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        You never met, did you?  This was JP
                        Monroe.
          
                                     JP CENOBITE
                        Have you seen what they did to me?  Have
                        you seen what they did?  You interfering
                        little whore!
          
          The JP Cenobite moves into the room.
          
          Joey, now near hysteria, rushes across the room again to the
          one remaining door - her bedroom.
          
          She throws that one open ...
          
          And Terri, the new FEMALE CENOBITE, walks out at her.  She has
          the open Box in her hand and several cigarette protruding from
          different holes in her cheek and face.
          
                                     JOEY
                        Terri?  Oh no!  NO!!  TERRI!!
          
                                     TERRI CENOBITE
                        Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You
                        think you're going to live forever?
          
          Pinhead and JP are advancing across the room toward Joey and
          Terri.  Joey only has seconds to act ...
          
                                     JOEY
                        Wanna light, you bitch?!
          
          Joey pulls her father's Zippo from her pocket and sparks it up
          as she swings it through the air close to Terri's face.
          
          A huge FLAME shoots out of the Zippo (as in the earlier scene)
          and scours across Terri's face.
          
          Terri howls in terror, throws her hands to her face ... and the
          Box flies from her hands.
          
          Joey catches it, spins it, closes it!
          
          An arc of BLUE LIGHT zaps across to Terri and she's gone ...
          
          Still in one movement, swinging on her heels, Joey twists the
          box again ...
          
          And another Arc of LIGHT zaps JP away ...
          
                                                                      92
          
          Joey completes her turn.  She's facing Pinhead.  She holds the
          Box before her like a weapon ... and she's got the monster in
          her sights ...
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Wait!
          
          His hands are raised palms out.  He's stopped advancing.
          
          Joey holds the Box ready, breathing heavy, waiting ...
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        You can send me back.  But why?  I can
                        help you, Joey.  I can give you what you
                        want.
          
                                     JOEY
                        You'll never know what I want ...
          
          (Despite what she's said, we see Joey's face register every
          word of Pinhead's reply, every nuance, every promise ... )
          
                                     PINHEAD
                        Respect.  Power.  You and I can put your
                        name on the World's lips, your face on
                        it's screens ...
          
          Camera TRACKS closer to the Box in Joey's hands as Pinhead
          speaks.  Closer and closer until it's side fills the screen.
          
          CROSS-FADE
          
          
          INT.  MS. SUMMERSKILL'S OFFICE   DAY
          
          CLOSE on the face of the Box, still filling the screen.
          
          SLOW PULL BACK to reveal that the Box is mounted on a plinth
          within a glass bell-jar.
          
          PULL BACK continues.  The bell-jar stands on a tall thin wooden
          sculpture stand.
          
          PULL BACK continues.  The stand is next to a large impressive
          desk in an even larger even more impressive office.
          
          And seated behind the desk is ... well, we can't really call
          her Joey - she's far too impressive for that ... is Ms. Joanne
          Summerskill.
          
          Her hair is different.  Her make-up is different.  Her clothes
          are different.  Everything about this woman speaks of power and
          sophistication.

   FADE IN:
   We roll credits over-

   Peal tight on a pattern of brown and black textures. The
   image begins to shake. Slow motion. Graceful.

   WE HEAR a low rhythmic THUMP, THUMP, THUMP...

   The surface slowly peels off like flecks of dried old paint
   as we pull back a little wider and realize that we're looking
   at an OLD DOOR.

   THUMP, THUMP, THUMP...

   The door continues to rattle. Something or someone is behind
   it, desperately fighting to get out.
   THUMP, THUMP, THUMP...

   Wider still to include the rusted, worn doorknob twisting
   back and forth and shaking. Whatever is in there -- it's
   locked inside.

   It's almost pitch black in here as a few beams of light fight
   W
   their way through holes in the torn black window shades of
   this flop-house apartment.
   TN A HIGH SHOT

   Te take in the scene. A young WOMAN, mid-twenties, lies on an
   old mattress tossed on the floor in the center of the room.
   There's a MAN asleep next to her with his arm around her.
   About a half-dozen others, in various stages of nakedness,
   are sprawled unconscious around the room.
   WE BOOM DOWN and as we do we-
  

   INT. CRACK DEN - NIGHT

   We're in the middle of a crack/X party the night before.

                                                     LASH CUT TO:

                               2



   Our YOUNG WOMAN (AMY KLEIN) moving through the party. She
   reaches into the pocket of her long black coat and lifts out
   a TAPE RECORDER. She clicks it on and slips it back into her
   pocket.

                                                   FLASH CUT TO:

   THE MAN from our opening shot offers her some X. She lets him
   place it on her tongue and then she swallows it. He smiles,
   pleased, and turns to leave. She quickly but slyly removes
   the X from her mouth and flicks it away.         F
                                                    LASH CUT TO:

   Later. The party in full gear. Things are really starting to
   get weird here as the crack pipe starts to make it's way
   around the room.

                                                   FLASH CUT TO:

   Amy's putting on a full "X" performance, taking the crack
   pipe and quickly passing it on, pretending to be too far gone
   for another hit, all the while studying the other partiers
   with a keen reporter's eye.

                                                   FLASH CUT TO:

   Later. After everyone has left. The sun is coming up. Amy
   alone with the MAN. He's half-naked on the mattress, trying
   to pull Amy close. Amy's looking for a safe exit, but she's
   stayed too long and he's starting to get a little rough with
   her. A wrong move now could push him over the edge.

                                                   FLASH CUT TO:

   Amy's vision starts to blur. Did he slip her something?

                                                   FLASH CUT TO:

   He pulls her onto the bed with him and starts to undress her,
   she can't fight him off. But then his eyes roll back in his
   head and he passes out.

                                                   FLASH CUT TO:

   Amy looks around the room which is starting to swirl. She
   tips out of frame and we-

   INT. CRACK DEN - DAY

   Back to scene as Amy's eyes flutter open, quickly adjusting
   to her unfamiliar surroundings. She freezes for a beat, then
   after determining that the Man is asleep, she slides her way
   off the mattress and rolls quietly onto the floor.
   S
    he's relieved when she finds that she's still dressed.

   She snatches a small TAPE RECORDER off the ground and clicks
   rewind -- satisfied.

   She snatches a half empty pack of smokes off the floor and
   she's gone.


   EXT. A BUILDING ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF LONDON - DAY

   A big sign identifies this old brick building as the home of
   "The London Underground" -- a weekly newspaper in the
   "Village Voice" mode, only scuzzier.

   INT. OFFICES OF THE UNDERGROUND - DAY

   MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE:

   A pair of elevator doors open. AMY KLEIN exits and walks
   towards camera. She's all in black, from her black sneakers
   and black stockings up to her tinted glasses and jet black
   hair. The only thing about her that isn't black is a
   complexion so translucently pale that it bespeaks only the
   most rare and grudging familiarity with daylight. She has a
   paper coffee cup and a cigarette in the same hand, and she
   alternates sips of coffee with puffs of her cigarette with a
   practiced proficiency. She ignores the unhappy looks of her
   fellow employees. She clearly has practice at this as well.

   Little office cubbies scattered around a converted loft
   space. "Too Hip" EMPLOYEES sit at their desks, typing at
   computers, conferring at tables -- going about the business
   of turning out another issue. They point and whisper as Amy
   walks by.

   Amy passes another cubicle as A YOUNG REPORTER holds the
   newspaper's FRONT PAGE up in front of Amy. A big headline
   reads, "How to be a Crack Whore" written over a photo of a
   crack den in which we glimpse things better left unseen.
   Beneath the headline is written, "A special report by Amy
   Klein."

                        YOUNG REPORTER (O.C)
              Nice reporting Klein. How `bout you show
              me what you learned?

   Amy is already past him, she throws back a middle finger for
   a response.

                        YOUNG REPORTER (O.C.)
              Maybe later.

   BETTY, 50ish, her glasses hanging on the tip of her nose,
   sees Amy coming.

                            ETTY
              Hey, Amy...

                           AMY
              Morning...

                        BETTY
              Morning? It's half past four.

                           AMY
              Mmm...

   Betty gives a broad gesture over her shoulder, pointing
   toward the Editor's office across the work space. Amy heads
   across the way, toward the office. Betty picks up the phone.

                        BETTY
                  (on phone)
              Mr. Rickman... Amy's here. Right.


    NT.   CHARLES RICKMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

   CHARLES RICKMAN, the Editor-in-Chief, is an Englishman in his
   early forties, sporting a pony tail which, like a moustache
   on a sixteen-year-old, only serves to emphasize his true age.
   He's fiddling around with some sort of TV/VCR set up, and is
   looking away from the door as it opens and Amy enters behind
   him.                 

                         CHARLES
                  (without turning)
              Ah, I detect that unique and ubiquitous
              combination of female sweat and patchouli
              oil that signals the arrival of...

   He turns toward a dour Amy.

                                                                       




                                                                       




                               5



                        CHARLES
              ...the delightful and world-famous Amy
              Klein. Have a seat, angel of light.

                        AMY
              Eat me, Charles.

                         CHARLES
              It's exactly that lack of respect for
              authority that got you fired from the New
              York Post.

                        AMY
              I wasn't fired. I was re-assigned.

                        CHARLES
              Of course. Where would you be without me?                
              By the way, I don't recall ever being                    
              thanked properly for this "re-                           
              assignment".                                             
   Charles makes air quotes with his fingers.

                        CHARLES (CONT'D)                               
              Lucky for you I opened my doors to you                   
              here as soon as I heard you were                         
              "available".    
                                         
   More air quotes. Amy walks over to a "trophy table" where
   she looks over a cluster of framed photo's. She points to one       
   of her and Charles, smiling together. More innocent times           
   for both.                                                           
                        AMY                                            
              I seem to recall a rather similar                        
              "reassignment" with you, Charles.
                        
                        CHARLES                                        
              Touche'. Well, thanks to international                   
              conglomerates and the Euro-dollar I,
              along with Mother England, am blessed                    
              with your acquaintance, yet again. 
                      
                        AMY
              Hey a contract's a contract.

   She holds up the cassette recorder.

                        AMY (CONT'D)                                   
              Look, if all this about me being late                    
              with the crack whore story It's all right
              here -- and it's gold. I was just about
              to-

                         CHARLES
                  (interrupting)
              It's not about the crack whores, I'm sure
              you're working your usual unrestrained
              insightful magic on what I'm certain will
              be another eye-opening expose. I expect
              nothing but brilliance -- in five
              thousand words or less.
                  (beat)
              But this is better.

   Amy spots an open container of Chinese food on Charles's
   desk. She inspects it, then picks something out of it with a
   pair of chop sticks.

                        AMY
              So what then? Are we being sued again?

                        CHARLES
              Hmm? Oh no.
                  (sees her eating)
              Please feel free to have some of that.

                        AMY
              Thanks. What is this? General Tso's cat?

                        CHARLES
              Spare me the "Nothing comes close to New
              York Chinese" speech just this once. Go
              on, sit down. Just something I wanted to
              show you...

   He heads back over to the VCR. Amy ditches the Chinese food
   and picks up her coffee again. She sits, lights another
   cigarette.

                        CHARLES
              Okay... rewind, rewind? Rewind.

   He finds the button, presses it and turns back to Amy.

                        CHARLES
              Somebody mailed us this thing around two
              weeks ago but, in keeping with our usual
              level of efficiency, Betty didn't get
              around to opening it `til this morning.
              Then she brought it to me.

                        AMY
              What is it?

   Charles closes the door.

                                7



                         AMY
              What's the matter? This X-rated or
              something?

                        CHARLES
              Something. Amy, with your encyclopedic
              world-wide knowledge of skank-ology --
              have you ever heard of "Deaders?"

                        AMY
              Oh, sure. They're generally in their
              forties, kind of ex-hippy types. They
              still think Jerry Garcia is like "really
              cool" even though he's dead.

                        CHARLES
              Not dead-heads...
              Dead - ers. D-E-A-D-E-R -- S.

                        AMY
              You know, sometimes they wear ponytails.
              Dream about how great the sixties were.
              You see `em in the park sometimes...

                        CHARLES
              Love of my life, go screw yourself. I'm
              asking you a serious question.

                         AMY
              No, Charles. I've never heard of
              "Deaders."

                        CHARLES
              Watch the tape.

   Charles goes to the VCR and hits the play button. Amy
   finishes her coffee and lights a new cigarette with the still-
   glowing butt of her last one. She leans forward.

   ON THE TAPE

   The image flickers into view. It's handheld, low-rez, clearly
   been shot in some dingy apartment somewhere, decorated in a
   "mattresses on the floor/beer spray on the walls" type decor.
   There are around half a dozen PEOPLE there, in their twenties
   and younger. They drift in and out of frame, in and out of
   focus.

   We hear a woman's voice -- clearly the person who is
   operating the camera, as the shot moves about the room. This
   is MARLA CHEN.

   


                               8



                        MARLA
                  (off screen)
              Okay, okay. Here we go. There's Anna...

   The camera hesitates for a fleeting moment on ANNA, a girl
   with bright dye-red hair (on the side of her head that isn't
   shaved). Anna looks, with no particular expression and goes
   away.

   The camera turns toward a smudged mirror on the wall and we
   get a look at Marla, a twenty-ish Asian girl.

                        MARLA
              Here's Marla Chen, official Deader
              Archivist. Hello, me.

    he camera turns toward a door as it opens and KATYA, a young
   round-faced girl with dark hair, comes out, looking a bit
   nervous.

                        MARLA
                  (off screen)
              And here's the star of the show. Katya...

   She gives a little smile. The camera swings over toward a
   mattress on the floor. Some of the people are tugging a
   plastic sheet over it. One of them, and the one who clearly
   appears to be in authority -- a man with albino-like features
   -- WINTER.

                        MARLA
              And here's our deader bed -- this is the
              scene of the crime. Crime to be...

    he camera moves in on Winter.

                        MARLA
              And here is the fearless leader of the
              Deaders... Winter.

   Winter glances up, then dismisses the camera altogether. He
   looks off screen, then raises his hand. The room quiets. We
   hear various voices.

                        VOICES
              Shh. Quiet. We're starting.

   Winter looks up and the camera swings toward Katya. She
   hesitates. A girl next to her starts to prompt her.

                        WINTER
              Do you become one of us of your own free
              will?

  




                               9



                        KATYA
              Yes.

                        WINTER
              Are you afraid?

                        KATYA
              Yes.

                        WINTER
              Good. Fear is the place we go to learn.

   She hesitates.

                          ATYA
                  (reciting)
              My skin isn't real. My eyes aren't real.
              My muscles aren't real. My bones, my
              heart, my veins and nerves, and flesh and
              meat... aren't real. What I see, what I
              hear, what I taste, what I touch, what I
              remember, what I think, what I feel,
              aren't real.

                         WINTER
                  (off screen)
              Go on.

                        KATYA
              I'm not real.

   The camera swings back to Winter, who gestures for her to
   come forward, then swings back to see her coming.

   The various people in the room gather around as she comes to
   the mattress. The camera moves this way and that, trying to
   get the best angle to cover the action. People spread towels
   on the mattress, over the plastic, as Katya, naked, sits down
   on the towels, then lays back, flat on the mattress.

    inter looks to the Black Kid standing next to him. He comes
   up with a big handgun -- maybe a .45.

                        KATYA
              I'm not real...

   The camera moves in closer as Winter takes the gun and slips
   it into Katya's hand.

                        KATYA
              I'm not... I'm not real...

    he slides the gun over and puts it to the side of her head.

  



                                 10



    AMY

    ...sits forward in her seat, not quite believing what she's
    seeing.

                          AMY
                Holy ... Charles...

                          CHARLES
                Just keep watching.


    ON THE TAPE

    Katya is breathing fast now, but we can't be sure if it's
    terror, or passion, or some combination of both. She
    continues to lie on the mattress, the barrel of the gun
    pressed against the side of her head.

                           KATYA
                I'm not real. I'm not...

    Winter reaches out, hesitant, and cocks the gun in her hand.
    Meanwhile, we see other hands, reaching in, pressing a folded
    up towel against the opposite side of her head. Other hands
    come in and press a doubled-over pillow against the towel.

                          KATYA
                I'm not real. I'm not... I'm not...

    She closes her eyes, grits her teeth. Her back arches.

    AMY

    drops her cigarette as it burns down to her fingers. She
    stands.


    ON THE TAPE

    Katya holds her breath... and pulls the trigger.

    There's a huge CONCUSSION as the bullet tears straight
    through her head. We can see it splatter out the other side,
    tearing through the towel and the folded over pillow, which
    catch a great blast of bone and brain.

    We hear some screams in the room.

    AMY jumps back.

                          AMY
                Have you called the police on this?

   


                                11



                        CHARLES
              Just watch...

                        AMY
              I want to know if you've called the
              pol...

                        CHARLES
              I said, "Just watch."

                        AMY
              Oh, man, don't tell me that was some
              special effect...

                        CHARLES
              You tell me.

                         AMY
              This is sick...

                        CHARLES
              That's saying a lot, for you.

    The camera is now pointing at Winter. There is a look of deep
    tenderness in his face as he circles around and kneels down,
    staring toward Katya, who is lying, as dead as dead can be,
    on the mattress. Blood has run from the ghastly wound down
    both sides of the plastic, and towels on the side of the bed
    catch the mess.

    Winter reaches down and gently removes the gun from Katya's
    lifeless hand... and then, light as a feather, lies down on
    top of her.

    The camera moves forward and down as Marla, presumably,
    elbows her way through for a better vantage point. The camera
    moves in close as Winter stretches out along Katya's body.

    He places his lips on her forehead, kissing her lightly, then
    presses his lips against hers -- kissing her -- or maybe
    something else. It seems almost as if he's breathing into
    her. His body moves as his lungs expand and expel, and he
    seems to be struggling toward some non-sexual climax.
    AMY watches, both repelled and fascinated.

 





                                12




    ON THE TAPE

    Winter continues his odd ritual, finally taking a great final
    breath, as if he's reached the point of exhaustion, and
    expels it. Nothing happens.

    He leans in close.

    WITH AMY

    Amy leans in close as well.

    WITH WINTER

    He draws in another breath -- he seems to be in agony as he
    does it -- presses his lips to Katya's dead ones, and
    exhales. The breath seems to go on forever -- longer than it
    should.

    And then, when it seems as if Winter can't breathe out
    another teaspoon of air, Katya's body abruptly twitches
    beneath him -- and then she sucks in a ragged breath. Her
    previously open and lifeless eyes, move. Her head raises up.

    WITH AMY

    She simply stares, breathing again for the first time in a
    moment, unable to quite take in what she's seeing.

    ON THE SCREEN

    Winter, exhausted, looks down at Katya, smiling. There's
    nervous laughter, sounds of relief from around the room.
    Winter slides off of her. Katya looks this way and that,
    presumably at the others, looking down at her.

    A hand reaches down and she takes it. The camera follows as
    Winter pulls her unsteadily up to standing. All this despite
    the fact that there is still an exceedingly large and obvious
    hole in her head... the size of a dime on one side, the size
    of a half-dollar on the other.

    The others move in, touching her, congratulating her. She's
    still a bit shaky, uncertain. Then she lifts one of her hands
    to the side of her head -- the side with the big exit wound.
    She touches it gingerly, confirming that it is really there.

    Then she slowly slides her fingers IN. They penetrate her
    skull, unobstructed, to the second knuckle. Katya takes her
    fingers from this ghastly wound and stares at them, bloody.
    Yet she's alive. Fine.

  


                             13


    She looks up at the others, then smiles widely. The others
    move in, giving her hugs, pecks on the cheek.

    She touches the wound again. She starts laughing.

                        KATYA
                  (as if actually realizing) it)
              I'm fine...

                         K
    She touches the wound again.

                         ATYA
              I feel great...

    She starts laughing.

                        KATYA
              Oh, man! Oh, man...

    The image cuts off, goes to snow. There is a moment of
    silence. Amy turns to Charles.

                        AMY
              What the hell...

                        CHARLES
              That's what I said.

                        AMY
              Have you... have you found any of
              these...

                        CHARLES
              I haven't done anything. I told you, I
              just looked at it today. By some chance
              are you... interested in pursuing this?

    Amy hesitates, shaking her head, not sure what it's all
    about.

                        CHARLES
              Look, Amy. Maybe this is just some kind
              of bull-shit shot-on-tape gore movie. And
              since that's all it can be, that's all
              you're going find, but it sure smells
              different to me. If it's bull-shit,
              you'll know pretty fast. If it's not...

    Amy, though, is only half listening, lost in her own
    thoughts.

                        AMY
              How could she...

                                14



                        CHARLES
              Who said miracles can only happen at
              Lourdes?

                        AMY
              Who said they happen there?

    She lifts her fingers to the side of her head, duplicating
    the action of Katya slipping her fingers inside the wound.

                         HARLES
              Amy... you know what my father said
              once...

                        AMY
              That all writers were queers?

                        CHARLES
              No, that was a different time. This time,
              we were driving down the block and there
              was this fortune-telling place, you know,
              this gypsy fortune telling place in a
              store front? And he said, "You know, if I
              could tell the future I wouldn't be
              living in any crappy store front."


    He looks back at the tape.


                        CHARLES
              If I could do that, I wouldn't be hanging
              out in some rundown basement. I'd own the
              earth.

                        AMY
              Maybe they're just getting started.

                         CHARLES
              Maybe.

                        AMY
              What else do we have besides the tape?

                        CHARLES
              Just a return address on the envelope.

    He holds up the envelope which is addressed to "AMY KLEIN C/O
    THE UNDERGROUND". Amy hesitates. Snatches the envelope out of
    his hand. She reads the return address.


                                15



                        CHARLES
              Looks like your online fan-base is
              growing. It's an address in Bucharest.
              It's where all the Euro-trash kids
              looking for a good time are heading these
              days. Amsterdam is so 90's.

     She's shocked that he would even know.

                        AMY
              Why Charles...

                        CHARLES
              I still like to keep my finger on the
              pulse, even though I know you think I
              don't have one.

    She thinks about it. He hands her a thick envelope.

                        CHARLES
              Your ticket, hotel and per diem.

    She smiles.

                        AMY
              You know me too well.

                         CHARLES
              It's what keeps me up at night.
                  (beat)
              Now here's the part where I'm supposed to
              say be careful. Be careful.

                         AMY
              Always.

                        CHARLES
              Call me when you get settled.

    She just smirks and exits.


    EXT. EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

    STOCK FOOTAGE a train rolling through the countryside.


    EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

    SUPER TITLE: BUCHAREST

    A cab pulls up to the front of the building. Amy gets out and
    walks up to the front door.

   



                                16


    She pulls an envelope out of her bag. It's the one that the
    tape came in. She checks the name on the envelope -- MARLA
    CHEN. Compares it to a name on the mailboxes.


    INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

    Amy walks past the lobby and up the stairs.


    INT. THE SECOND FLOOR - DAY

    Amy makes her way down the narrow dark hallway and finds the
    appropriate door. She knocks at it. No answer.

    She looks down and sees a lone fly crawl out from under the
    door. Then another follows, and another. She kneels down to
    inspect it.

    She leans forward and sniffs. The results are inconclusive.
    Then she lays herself flat down on the floor, presses her
    nose up against the bottom of the door and sniffs.

    The smell of dead wretched air is overwhelming.

    And that's when a large WORN SHOE steps into frame right in
    front of Amy.

                        MANAGER (O.C.)
                  (irritated, with appropriate
                   accent)
              Have you lost something?

    Amy leaps up in one quick move to find herself face to face
    with THE MANAGER, an older man who's a little winded from his
    climb up here. Between his teeth he clenches a half chewed,
    three quarter smoked cigar. The smoke seeps through his
    yellowed teeth.

                        AMY
              Yes, I ah.....

    She pats her pockets. Then tries another tactic.

                        AMY
              No. I'm looking for my sister. Marla
              Chen.

                        MANAGER
              You're not Chinese.

   




                                17



                        AMY
              She's my half sister. Same Mom. Different
              Dads. I haven't heard from her in two
              weeks so I got nervous.

    The Manager stares at her in disbelief. Knows she's up to
    something. Amy sniffs the air coming from the room again.

                        AMY
              Does it always smell like this in here?

    The Manager blows a bloom of smoke out of his nostrils. He
    yanks the cigar from his mouth and sniffs. Doesn't seem that
    bad to him.

                           MANAGER
              Like what?

                        AMY
              Look. Marla is a friend of mine and
              she's missing.

     my pulls a few American bills from her pocket.

                        AMY
              I need five minutes in there. Then I'll
              know what I need to know.

    The Manager stares at the money for a beat, then stares back
    at Amy. He bites down on his cigar and snatches it out of her
    hand.

                        MANAGER
              Five minutes.

    He pulls out his ring of keys and unlocks the door.

    Amy enters. The place is dark and cold. Eerily quiet. The
    manager stays in the hallway, he looks at Amy and taps his
    watch. Amy nods as he pulls the door closed.

    She descends down the dark hallway. Her face tightens as she
    takes in the deathly ripe air. The BUZZING of flies getting
    louder with each step.

    As she approaches a room, she recoils, clutching her face
    from the stench. She inhales -- drawing in the smell to
    acclimate herself -- and almost vomits. She steadies herself,
    drawing in breaths through her nose, tentative at first, and
    finally in larger breaths, until she can tolerate it.

     he looks back toward the entry door, she is alone.

   



                                18




    INT. MARLA'S ROOM - DAY

    Amy steps in and stops, struggling to keep herself from
    retching.

    No sign of anything dead. No sound except the sinister
    buzzing of flies. Amy steps cautiously in.

    She looks toward one side, sees a closet with a double
    sliding door. She slides open one side, sees nothing that
    shouldn't be there -- a ragged winter jacket, a green plastic
    raincoat, a hangar festooned with scarfs, some other garments
    still obscured beneath cleaning bag plastic.

    She hesitates, then calmly slides the other side open. More
    of the same.

    She turns in the other direction. There's a little kitchen.
    Nothing dead there. She starts forward then turns back --
    staring at the refrigerator. She goes quickly over and tugs
    it open. It's empty. Not so much as a ketchup bottle.
    Curious, she opens the freezer. The same. Empty.

    She heads through the living room and down a narrow corridor
    leading to another bedroom. At the end of the hallway is a
    bathroom. The door to the bathroom is open and the toilet, on
    the far wall, faces the door.
    Marla is there.

    Dressed only in bra and panties, she is sitting on the closed
    lid of the john, leaning forward in what seems, at first, to
    be an impossible angle. Her hands hang forward, almost
    touching the floor. Her head is cocked back, staring up. Her
    skin is gray, swollen.

    Amy takes a few steps forward, for a better look. As she
    approaches, she sees the reason for the odd position of the
    body.

    A long boot-lace has been tied around Marla's neck and tied
    to the wall pipe on the toilet. The flesh of her neck has
    swollen out, almost burying the boot-lace. She has hanged
    herself in this ghastly way.

    Amy takes another step forward. As she does, there's a sudden
    loud buzzing as the flies that crawl on Marla abruptly rise
    up, alarmed (or whatever it is flies are) at her approach.
    But they soon return to the corpse, crawling about the face,
    around the edges of the glazed, eyes, around the margins of
    the open mouth, rimmed with dry foam -- around the out-thrust
    tongue.

    




                                19



    Amy covers her mouth with her shirt, trying to filter out the
    stench. She backs away from the body and into another room.

    IN THE BEDROOM

    Amy starts to search -- fast, thorough, -- she's done this
    sort of thing before. She finds a journal, opens it... no
    writing. She tosses it aside. Pulls open a drawer. She tugs
    out what looks like a blade-less knife handle. She presses a
    stud. A STILETTO BLADE SPRINGS OUT. She tosses it back in the
    drawer, tugs some other stuff into view.

    Some bills, some shoelaces, loose change. She goes drawer to
    drawer, looking for anything that might mean something.
    Socks, ragged underwear, cheap jewelry, tee shirts and short
    skirts and jeans.

    Amy stops, surveying the territory. Where to look next? Then,
    deciding, she goes to the bed.

     She reaches under it, sliding her hand around, tugs out a
    dust-encrusted skirt. Feels around some more, hesitates,
    pulls something else out. She brings it out into view. It's a
    desiccated mouse. She grimaces and tosses it back under the
    bed in disgust.

    She stops... then slides her hand between the mattress and
    the box spring. She feels around, then stops, finding
    something. She pulls out a little red paper folder -- the
    kind that photographs come from. She opens it.

    It appears to be a photographic record of another "deader"
    party. We see some of the same participants -- we also see
    Marla herself in some of the pictures. She's smiling. Amy
    flips the next photograph.

     It shows Marla next to Winter. He's holding something in his
    hand. Amy looks closer. THE PUZZLE BOX -- Amy turns another
    photograph and it shows somebody holding the box out in front
    of Marla.

    The picture is framed through a length of rope with a noose
    on one end. Marla is on the other side-- Almost a kind of
    "joke" photo.

    She has a kind of sickly smile on her face. Amy's eyes
    narrow. She holds the picture closer. There seems to be a
    figure lost in shadows, and the closer she looks the more
    reality merges with the grains of the photo. What is there? A
    man?

  



                                20



    Amy hears a scratching noise coming from outside the room.
    She stuffs the book in her satchel.

    Amy turns toward the door that leads to the hall and the
    unseen bathroom. She sits, silent, waiting.
    
    Then the sound of the scratching comes again. The sound of
    flies rising -- and again, more distinct -- something
    scratching. She keeps her position, still listening. Nothing.
    Just the slow steady, untroubled buzzing.

    She moves toward the bathroom.

    And again there's the tiny scratching, and the rush of sound,
    as if something has disturbed the flies.

    The sound stops. The flies are still except for the
    occasional buzz.

    She advances, until she can glimpse the edge of one of
    Marla's hanging, out-thrust hands, the tip of one finger just
    touching the floor. Marla's long fingernails are painted
    green.

    THE BATHROOM

    She comes around the edge of the bathroom door. Marla is
    motionless.

    She leans from the pipe by the shoelace. The shoelace is
    still buried in her throat. The flies buzz up again.   The
    glazed eyes remain fixed in their sockets. One of her hands
    is not visible from Amy's position.. We see scratches on the
    floor beneath her fingernails.

    Amy steels herself -- and then walks closer. On the corner of
    the sink, there's a thick manila envelope with something
    bulky inside -- something that looks just like a cassette
    tape. There's a name written on it, and the marker is right
    next to it. It reads "AMY"

    Amy must reach past the corpse in order to reach the
    envelope, horribly close to the body in doing so.

    She enters the cramped space and reaches toward the sink. She
    is about six inches shy of grabbing it. She notices that her
    hip is almost touching Marla's face as she leans. The flies
    stir. The stench rises.

    She stretches closer, and Marla's body is pushed aside a few
    inches. Closer and closer AMY reaches.

    




                                21



    Her outstretched fingers just manage to touch the envelope.
    She pitches it and pulls it toward her.

    It falls off the sink and onto the floor behind Marla.

    Now, Amy must kneel, and reach past Marla face. She holds her
    breath as she reaches long and far...

    She manages to grab the envelope, but her face is almost
    cheek to cheek with the rotting corpse. As she pulls the
    envelope up, she notices something else in Marla's hidden
    hand.

    THE PUZZLE BOX.

    Amy reaches over and pries open Marla's hand. Her blackened
    fingers snap as they are pulled off the box. Amy grabs the
    box and envelope, stuffs them into her bag, and stands.

    As she stands next to Marla's body suddenly-

    MARLA'S HAND GRABS AMY'S LEG!

    Amy shrieks and swats the dead hand away, falling backward
    onto the floor as she does. She rolls over and, in a half-
    crawl, half-scramble, gets herself back up to her feet.

    Amy backs up against a wall, kicking Marla as she kicks the
    floor. We can't tell if Marla is moving from the kicks or if
    she is somehow alive. Either way, its to much for Amy. She
    stops moving.

    Marla's mouth emits a ghastly sound as a stream of liquid
    falls to the floor. Its almost as if she is trying to speak.

    Amy has seen enough. Up she goes as she tears down the hall,
    through the living room and SMACK INTO THE MANAGER!

    Which needless to say, scares the shit out of her. He's
    standing inside the now open door to the apartment.

                         AMY
              She's dead...

                         MANAGER
              Dead...

                        AMY
              Dead! She hung herself in the bathroom.
              Call the police.



                                22



    The Manager grabs Amy by the arm. He pulls the cigar from his
    mouth and points it in her direction. Amy hears police sirens
    in the background.

                         MANAGER
               Already did. Who are you?
                   (pointing his cigar at Amy's
                    satchel)
               What do you have in there?

    In a flash Amy twists her arm out of his grasp, and slings
    her knee up into his nuts. He doubles over.


    INT. THE HALL AND STAIRWAY - DAY

    Amy comes flying down the hall at top speed. She reaches the
    top of the stairs and starts down... ...and as she does, her
    feet slip.

    She slides down five or six steps, then over-balances,
    throwing out her hands to keep her chin from hitting the
    polished stone steps. She keeps sliding down, finally over-
    balancing again, flipping over and landing on her back on the
    landing half-way between the floors.
                         A
                             MY
               Dammit!

    The Manager looks down the stairs for her. He doesn't even
    attempt to chase her.

                            MANAGER

               Stop her!

    He curses her in his native tongue.


    EXT.   SIDEWALK - DAY

    Amy breaks through the doors of the building. She hits two of
    the ten stairs down to the sidewalk. People walking by hardly
    notice.

    Up ahead, a police car is turning down the street. She stops
    and walks calmly, diverting her eyes. The police car races
    by, and Amy walks faster, and faster, then runs.

              



                                23




    INT. AMY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

    Close on a tray of ice being cracked apart. It's contents
    poured into a open towel.

    Amy is sitting on the floor in front of her couch, now
    dressed in only panties and a bra -- an image unpleasantly
    reminiscent of Marla -- especially with the spotting of
    bruises and roughly bandaged scrapes on her pale skin.

    She has a dripping ice pack in one hand, which she applies to
    this bruise and that -- and a bottle of gin in the other. She
    doesn't look happy. She takes a drink, then looks toward a TV
    and VCR in front of her.

    There's a tape half-inserted into the VCR. We can see the
    empty envelope with "AMY" written on it, lying on the floor.

      he tape is within reach of Amy's bare foot, and she lifts a
    toe toward it, hesitant. She puts her toe against the
    tape...hanging on the edge of decision. Finally, she shoves
    it forward with her toe.
    
    It slides into the machine. She grabs up the remote and turns
    on the set. The IMAGE appears.

    It's Marla, looking like she hasn't slept in days, sitting on
    a chair in her apartment staring into camera. Her eyes are
    glazed, distant. But she looks a hell of lot better than she
    did in the bathroom.

                        MARLA
                   (a little sad)
              I knew you'd come. Course if you're
              watching this tape, it's already too late
              for me. But maybe you can stop it.

    Amy removes the PUZZLE BOX from her satchel. Stares at it.

                         MARLA
              He promised us pleasures beyond anything
              we could ever imagine. We just had to
              fight through the pain first. Easier said
              than done.
                  (beat)
              Don't open the box Amy. If you do Winter
              wins, and if he wins-
    
    Someone pounds on a door. Marla panics.

            


                               24



                          MARLA
                    (hurried)
                Go to Pletkow station at midnight. Go to
                the south end of the platform and step
                onto the last car. Find a guy named Joey
                who runs the show and tell him I sent
                you. He'll guide you to them.

    The POUNDING GETS LOUDER.

                          WINTER (O.S.)
                Marla!

                          MARLA
                Save them Amy. Please...

                          WINTER (O.S.)
                Marla!

    Marla leaps forward and-

                          MARLA
                Those you trust the most -- trust the
                least.

    - shuts off the camera. It goes black for a few seconds, and
    then cuts to snow.

    Amy sits, staring at the snow, her face empty. She sets the
    PUZZLE BOX on the table and stares at it. Takes a sip of her
    drink.

                          AMY (TO HERSELF)
                Don't open it. Right.

        phone rings. It shakes Amy out of her fugue.

    She leans over picks up the receiver. An old style phone.

                           AMY
                Yeah...


    INT. CHARLES RICKMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

    Charles sits at his desk. He is twisting pencils in a small
    plastic sharpener.

    (Intercut conversation.)

                          CHARLES
                Don't tell me I woke you up. I won't
                believe that.

                            25



                        AMY
              You know I don't sleep when I'm working.
              What do you want, Charles?

                        CHARLES
              You were supposed to call me.

                         AMY
              You know me, I dove right in. I was
              gonna' call you tomorrow.

                        CHARLES
              The thing is... I started thinking.

                        AMY
              You know that's never a good thing
              Charles.

    Amy looks at the Puzzle box on the table. It seems to be
    reflecting the snow of the TV set in some strange form.

    She looks closer, it's an ABSTRACT IMAGE OF A LITTLE GIRL
    SCREAMING.   She compares it to the TV set, it shows only
    white static snow.

                        CHARLES
              Look. I know the crazy stuff you do for a
              story.

                        AMY
              That's what I get paid for.

                        CHARLES
              And that's why I hired you. It's just.
              Just... the thing is, Amy... some things
              you shouldn't do, you know what I mean?

    Charles finishes a pencil and blows off the shavings.

                           AMY
              Like what?

                        CHARLES
              Look, I say this to you, but in my heart
              I know that one time it's going to
              happen... that you're going to end up, I
              don't know -- dead or god knows what. But
              when it does happen, I don't want it to
              be my fault.

    She watches the image of the little girl fade.

    




                                26



                        AMY
              Okay, Charles. I'll make sure it won't
              be.

                        CHARLES
              You know, you're messing with my
              conscience, here. Amy...

                        AMY
              Charles, I can't do the sensitive thing.
              I don't know how. I get the message. I
              knew the message before I got it. Okay,
              Mommy? You've had a change of heart? You
              want me to come home? Well I can't. Not
              until I know the truth. So there. You're
              off the hook. I gotta go.
    

    INT. AMY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

    Amy hangs up. She waits a moment, hesitates -- then takes the
    PUZZLE BOX from the table. She begins to explore it's edges
    with her fingers, rolling it over and over in her hands.

    It starts to unlock.

    She jumps as it begins to change shape, and sets it back on
    the table. Light seems to emanate from within as it clicks
    into another form. The table beneath it seems tremble, the
    ice in her drink taps against the edge of the glass.

      figure appears in the darkness behind her. PINHEAD. Here we
    go folks-

    THE PHONE RINGS. She nearly leaps out of the chair, striking
    the puzzle box with her hand. The Puzzle Box closes.

    PINHEAD vanishes back into the shadows.

                        AMY
              Charles, I get the message. OK?    Your my
              editor, not my Mommy!
                  (long beat)
              Charles?

    Amy waits. But there's no sound.

                        AMY
              Hello? Hello?

    A sound comes over the line -- a hoarse gurgling sound - a
    ghastly wet sound - the same sound Amy heard coming from the
    throat of the hanged Marla.

   



                                  27



                          MARLA
                    (through phone, wet choking
                     voice)
                Don't open...

    The line goes dead. She shoves the whole phone away from her.
    She sits, breathing fast for a second, staring at the box.
    Quiet. Only the sound of the snow on the TV.

    She stands and pulls her pants on.


    INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

    A thunderous noise trails a subway car as it streaks out of a
    station.

     Lit with cold fluorescent light, Amy, now dressed, with her
    sunglasses in place, slides her card through the slot and
    shoves through the turnstile. She descends the long, non-
    working escalator -- the only one on it at this time of
    night.
    
    She reaches the subway platform. It is virtually empty.

    Amy has come down stairs that land her just about in the
    middle. She scans the far end of the platform, past a lone
    FIGURE in a SHINY GREEN PLASTIC RAINCOAT who lies motionless
    on a bench.

    - a couple MIDDLE-AGED GUYS in security uniforms, maybe
    heading for some night shift somewhere, stand, not moving,
    hands thrust in pockets.

    She turns back to the bench but the FIGURE in the SHINY GREEN
    RAINCOAT is gone.

    She takes up a position at the far end of the platform. She
    waits.

    A moment later, a bit of a breeze starts moving her hair. A
    few seconds later, a train comes roaring into the station.
    Amy watches the car pass her, one by one, as the train slows.
    The train is virtually empty. One car after the next rolls by
    as the train slows.

    Finally, as the train moves slowly to a stop, a car different
    from the others comes in. This one, for some odd reason,
    seems to have newspaper covering all the windows -- taped up
    from the inside.

   



                                28



    One of the doors of the covered car comes to a stop directly
    in front of the spot where Amy is standing -- the spot marked
    by the stenciled PUZZLE BOX. There's a pause, then the doors
    slide open -- just one the one set in front of Amy. The
    others stay closed. The interior of the car is dark -- the
    lights, apparently, are not working.

    A tall ODD-LOOKING MAN in a CONDUCTOR'S UNIFORM is standing
    there. He gestures toward the adjoining car.

                          ONDUCTOR
              Next car.

                        AMY
              Is Joey on this ride?

                        CONDUCTOR
              Come on in...

    She enters. The doors slide closed. The train pulls out.


    INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

    The interior of the car has been transformed into some odd-
    ball cross between a very small nightclub and an crackhouse..

    As the train passes out of the station, and the lights dim,
    we can see the lights from joints and crack pipes -- or at
    any rate something being smoked in some kind of pipe,
    glinting in the darkness. Various hands reach up and tug down
    the newspapers, and the tunnel lights come in, providing a
    flickering, constantly changing illumination.

    In the uncertain light, Amy can see the various CELEBRANTS
    hanging out -- some on the seats, some on the floor, some
    dressed, some partially undressed, some engaging in desultory
    drug use, others in desultory sex acts -- mostly teenagers
    and twenty-nothings.

    Amy looks around, not particularly effected by the oddness of
    the scene. The Conductor touches her arm.

                        CONDUCTOR
              Down that way...

    She threads her way through the tangle of people. In the
    flickering lights she catches glimpses of pale human flesh,
    PIERCED FACES, PIERCED NIPPLES -- PIERCED THINGS that we
    can't even be sure what they are.

    Expressions flash by in the flickering light, some dull,
    others laughing.

                                29


    She pretty much ignores it all as she makes her way toward
    the rear of the car. A rat feeds on the contents of a young
    woman's purse as she and another woman are tangled in
    passion.

    There, illuminated in flashes, JOEY, a thin ill-shaven
    English guy in his mid-twenties is sprawled on a seat. One of
    his lower eyelids has a ring in it. It flicks up every time
    he blinks. He reads a newspaper while a woman bobs her head
    up and down in his lap.

    Joey looks up and spots Amy. He points an accusing finger at
    her, but his mood is good-natured..

                         JOEY
              Ahhhh, now here comes a daring soul. A
              person committed to a just cause. Another
              seeker of the truth no doubt.

    Joey is clearly smitten with Amy.

                        JOEY (CONT'D)
              I like what I see inside of you.

                        AMY
              Are you Joey?

                        JOEY
              I've been called worse.

    He brushes the hair of the woman in his lap, then offers Amy
    his hand.

                        JOEY
              And I have the privilege of meeting...

    Amy looks at the woman in his lap, declines a hand shake.

                        AMY
              Amy Klein. Marla Chen sent me. I'm
              looking for a girl named Katya. Another
              young girl with red hair and half her
              head shaved. A guy with glasses named
              Winter.

    Joey's eyes narrow. Something has clearly clicked. He laughs
    slightly, starts shaking his head.

                        JOEY
              And the plot thickens. Don't tell me
              you're mixed up with those mother
              fuckers. Tell me Amy Klein, do you even
              know what they're about?

                              30



                        AMY
              That's why I'm here. I need you to help
              me find them.

                        JOEY
              Oh, jeez. Moral quandary time here...
              What should he do, what should he do? If
              he tells her -- the hopefully available
              and eminently fuckable damsel is thrown
              into the pit of oblivion -- or anyway is
              potentially fucked up for life. And that
              would be such a regrettable waste. If he
              refrains from telling her... she may yet
              be saved. A possible trophy awaits me.
              Angel and devil on the shoulder... hmm.
              Angel, devil, angel, devil. Oh, the hell
              with it Entropy's destroying everything
              anyway. Why shouldn't I do my part?
                        A
                         MY
              Tell me what you know about the Deaders.

                        JOEY
              You first. What do you think they do?

                        AMY
              I think they bring the dead back to life.

                        JOEY
              Is that what you really think?

                        AMY
              Who are they? Where can I find Winter?

                        JOEY
              Some people say Winter's some sort of
              fucked-up guru, some say he's not human,
              and others say he's not real. But there
              is a place they hang out -- those who
              believe I mean.

                        AMY
              Where is it?

    Joey hesitates. A part of him clearly doesn't want to tell.

                         AMY
              Joey...

                        JOEY
              Angel, devil, angel, devil.

                                31



                        AMY
              If you don't tell me, someone here will.

                        JOEY
              Yeah, you see, now that's the problem.
              You've got that fucked up self-
              destructive thing going on.

                        AMY
              I'm already into it.

                        JOEY
              Angel, devil, angel, devil

    Amy produces the Puzzle Box from her pack. Joey looks at it
    like he's just seen a ghost.

                        JOEY
              This is making me very unhappy...

    He pushes the woman from his lap. He's more serious now.

                        JOEY (CONT'D)
              Poteilari and Minvara. On the northeast
              corner, two doors down, there's a
              stairway going down into a closed up
              building. It's always locked, and they're
              not always there. I don't know where they
              are when they're not. And once you get
              mixed up with them -- it's like that
              story with the tar baby -- chances are
              you never get loose, and if you do, you
              never get clean.

    The "Conductor" shouts from somewhere.

                           CONDUCTOR
              Coming in!

    Hands promptly reach up, covering the windows with newspaper.
    The Conductor goes to the door. The band finishes its set as
    the light from the station shines through the newspapers.
    Joey, looking drab in the steady uneven light, stares at Amy.

                         JOEY
              I can't take responsibility for you.

                        AMY
              I'm not asking you to.

    Amy begins to walk off. Joey leans forward, for the first
    time he seems sincere, almost foreboding. He shouts over the
    breaking train.

  


                                32



                         JOEY
              Amy Klein, I'm doing a change of heart
              thing here, which doesn't usually happen
              with strangers, but I'm trying to give a
              little back, it's this whole Karma kick
              I'm on -- don't do it. Don't go any
              deeper. Forget about it. Move away.
              Change your name. Become somebody
              different.

     The other members of the car watch the two of them.

                        AMY
              Can't do that. I've got that fucked up
              self- destructive thing going on.

                        JOEY
              Yes you do.

    The one door hisses open. Amy stares at Joey for a second,
    turns and departs, back into the fluorescent lit station.

    Joey calls after her.

                        JOEY
              Only he can bring you back!


    INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT

    Amy stands on the platform as the door hisses shut. The train
    pulls away. She checks her watch, then moves to the other
    side of the platform. She looks down the tunnel. The light
    from an approaching train is beginning to reflect off the
    curved wall of the tunnel.

    She turns back in the direction she just looked. Far down the
    platform, there's a bench with a lone occupant - - a slumped
    over figure dressed in a SHINY GREEN RAINCOAT. She turns
    toward it, staring. In the distance, no details of face or
    form are visible -- just the lumpy figure in the shiny green
    raincoat. She takes a step toward it, but still cannot make
    out any detail in the slumped over figure. She approaches...
    as does the train. There is no sign of movement.

    She comes around, closer to the edge of the platform, to get
    a more direct view of the green-coated form. As she does, she
    sees that one hand is draped off the front edge of the bench,
    hanging limp. The hand is gray.

    Amy takes a step forward.

  


                                33



    His eyes pop open! He looks at her with large black eyes,
    dead eyes. Dripping from beneath his raincoat is a small pool
    of fresh blood.

    Amy gasps, takes a step back -- and her heel lands on the
    edge of the subway platform. She struggles for balance.

    Abruptly, a man's voice comes from somewhere.

                           VOICE
              Amy Klein!

    Amy stumbles forward, goes down to her knees and turns.
    Around twenty feet behind her, standing on the edge of the
    platform, with his back toward the drop, is-

    - WINTER, wearing a black trench-coat, cinched at the waist.

    He looks down the tunnel. Amy does as well. The train is
    coming into the station. She turns back toward Winter. He
    stares at her, with malevolent eyes.

    And as the train comes flying in, he calmly falls backward,
    directly into its path.

    Amy screams.

    In an instant she's up, running alongside the braking train.
    The doors open, but virtually nobody comes out. The front of
    the train is still far ahead.

                         AMY
              Hey! You hit someone! Someone fell in
              front of the train! Hey! Hey!

    The doors hiss and start to close. Finally, Amy reaches the
    front window of the train. She hammers on it. It opens and a
    middle-aged WOMAN'S face leans out -- the DRIVER.

                        AMY
              Somebody fell... somebody fell in front
              of the train.

                        DRIVER
              Where? Where is he? Where'd he fall?

                        AMY
              Back there, way back...

    She looks back in the direction from which she's come. The
    bench is now empty.

                                                          T




                                  34



                        DRIVER
              Aw, damn... Dammit!

    Amy, though, is now looking, this way and that -- at the
    confused faces of people peeking out through the doors of the
    train. There is no sign of Winter

                                                           IME CUT:


    INT. TRAIN STATION - LATER

    The train is still there, doors open. There are TRANSIT COPS
    on the station, disgruntled passengers hanging out on the
    platform... TRACK WORKERS are poking around underneath it.

    Amy is leaning against one of the metal pillars, staring at
    the empty bench -- at the place where the mysterious figure
    was sitting. She's looking grim.

    Behind her, a Track Worker approaches the DRIVER, who's
    standing with a pair of Transit Cops. He's shaking his head,
    shrugging. The Driver curses, heads back toward the first
    car. One of the COPS approaches Amy.

                        COP
              Well, the men have looked.

                        AMY
              And there's nothing there?

                        COP
              You don't seem terribly surprised.

                         AMY
              Hmm?

    There's a sudden hiss. Amy turns as the train doors close.

                        COP
              I mean, you don't seem terribly surprised
              that there isn't somebody under the
              train.    A
                         MY
              I don't know what to say. I saw him...

                        COP
              Yeah. That's the thing. Can you tell me
              again, just what it is that you saw?

                        AMY
              Um, I was standing on the platform...

    



                                35



    The train starts to move out of the station. Amy looks toward
    it. The train is moving on one of the center tracks, so that
    you can look through the windows of the cars and see through
    them to the platform on the far side.

                        AMY
              ...and, um... I saw this man standing on
              the edge of the platform, facing away
              from it.

    But now Amy is seeing something -- through the windows of the
    moving train. On the platform on the far side, there is a
    lone figure, the man in the black trench-coat. Amy jumps,
    looks more closely.

                        COP
              Did he say anyth...

                           AMY
              It's him.!

    In an instant, Amy is tearing down the platform, heading for
    the stairs that connect to the platform on the other side.

                         COP
              Hey...

    Amy is watching, staring through the moving train windows.
    The figures are still there. Winter is staring at her -

                        COP
              Hey, stop! Tomislav! Tomislav!

     n the next instant, the Cop is giving chase, and another
    Cop, clearly, the "Tomislav" called by the first Cop, further
    down the station, is rushing in to head Amy off.

                        AMY
              It's them! Over there, over there!

     n the next instant, Tomislav tackles Amy and she goes down
    on her face. Even with the rather large Cop on top of her,
    she's still struggling.

                        AMY
              God damn it, get off of me! Get the hell
              off of me... Get...

    She keeps struggling as the first Cop, and the others on the
    station, converge on her. She looks toward the far platform.

    


                                36



    The figure is still there, visible through the windows of the
    departing train. Then, the last car of the train passes,
    leaving an unencumbered view of the far side.

    The platform is empty. No sign of Winter. No sign of anybody.

    Amy stop struggling, as the Cops tug her arms back,
    handcuffing her. She hardly notices, but keep staring at the
    empty platform across the tracks. She glances up at the Cops.


      panting Tomislav looks down at her. Then circles his finger
    around his ear to his comrades. They all understand.

                        TOMISLAV (IN ROMANIAN)
              She's Crazy.


    INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

    Amy sits slouched in a chair looking particularly pale. The
    door opens behind her. She hears a familiar voice.

                        CHARLES (O.S.)
              Is this where they keep the cheaper
              whores?

    Amy glances up at him, without expression.

                        CHARLES
              Christ, you're lucky to have a boss like
              me. Once again, I have saved your small
              but relatively shapely behind.

                        AMY
              Least you got to travel. What were they
              going to charge me with, anyway?

                        CHARLES
              Charge you? They were thinking of
              shipping you to the government asylum for
              observation -- and believe me if you go
              in there, you don't come out. But through
              my mastery of international negotiations
              I managed to convince them that you were
              merely irresponsible. You got your stuff?

                         AMY
              Yeah.

                         CHARLES
              Come on.

                         37



    Slowly, feeling her bruises, Amy gets up.


    EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

    Charles and Amy walk and talk. It's pissing down rain.
    Charles hold an umbrella for the two to share.

                        AMY
              Why'd you give me this story?

                        CHARLES
              Who else would have taken it? Either
              they're going to think it's bull-shit, or
              they're going to be too afraid of it. But
              Amy Klein... Tell me it's real Amy.

                        AMY
              It's real -- or I'm crazy.

                        CHARLES
              Well, either way, it's a good story.

                        AMY
              I've got leads. I'll know in the end.

                        CHARLES
              You know, Amy dearest, for the average
              person, hunger for knowledge is like
              hunger... for food. We want to know just
              enough to take the edge off our appetite.
              Then we're satisfied, and we stop. But
              you... you're like a glutton. You can't
              help over-eating.

                        AMY
              I don't see you complaining.

                        CHARLES
              But you see, that's the point. That's why
              I need you. Because all that stuff I
              don't eat... I still want. So I send you
              in to do the eating for me, and so I get
              to experience it, without actually
              suffering any mental indigestion.

                        AMY
              That's for me...

                        CHARLES
              Nobody's forcing anything down your
              throat. Correct?

                            38



                         AMY
              No.

                        CHARLES
              You see, Amy, you never grew up with all
              this Catholic god and guilt stuff. It
              doesn't mean anything to you. I worry
              about god and heaven and hell. Not during
              the day, you understand, but around three
              in the morning, it keeps me up. I want to
              know what's coming. What's up in heaven
              and down in hell, or even if there's
              nothing. It's useful, when you're making
              plans. So go find out and we'll tell the
              world.

                        AMY
              You know, Charles, there's something
              vaguely demonic about you.

                        CHARLES
              Did you know, the word "demon" comes from
              the Greek word for "knowledge." As in
              "demonstrate."

                        AMY
              No, I didn't know that.

    Charles shakes his head, disgusted.

                        CHARLES
              American education.

    They're in front of Amy's Hotel now. Charles flags down a
    CAB.


                        CHARLES
              Then back to your room, lie down in your
              coffin until the hours of daylight have
              passed, as is your wont -- then go get me
              my story. A

                         MY
              You don't have to worry.

                        CHARLES
              I never do. I'm not here to save people
              and I'm not here to judge them. I just
              take `em as they come. And use them as
              they pass by. I'll be at the Soffitel.

  



                                39



    Charles hops in the cab and drives off as Amy walks up the
    steps to the Hotel lobby. Amy watches him go, waves, then
    spins back towards the curb. She flags down a cab and hops
    in.


    EXT. POTEILARI AND MINVARA - DAY

    A ragged, run-down place, looking bleak and ugly in the
    bright light of day. We see the street sign, identifying the
    place -- Poteilari and Minvara. A cab pulls up and Amy gets
    out.

    She crosses the street, passes one side door -- and then
    comes to a building that's been sealed up -- doors and
    windows cemented shut with cinder-blocks.

    Beyond a narrow railing is a stairway, pressed up sideways
    against the building, running down to a basement entrance.
    Amy looks down the stairway to it's narrow bottom. The stairs
    and the bottom are littered with trash. A filthy mattress
    lies at the very bottom. Amy heads down.

    EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS - DAY

    At the bottom of the stairs, there's a wooden door. A hole
    has been punched through it and a heavy padlocked chain has
    been threaded through it and through a heavy hasp that's been
    bolted to the door frame. Some official government notice of
    some kind has been tacked to the door -- long rendered
    unreadable by the effects of time.

    Amy inspects the padlock. It's heavy and uncompromising. She
    tugs on the door and it opens to the limits of the chain --
    but that's only a few inches. Amy peers into the darkness
    beyond, but can't see a thing.

    She looks down at the mattress that she's standing on, steps
    to the side and shoves it up.

    Then, as if the light breaks, she reaches out, grabs the hasp
    and pulls. The bolts holding the hasp to the wall are loose.
    They slide out with it. She tugs the whole thing free and
    pulls the door open.

    There is a narrow corridor beyond, all in gloom. Amy enters.

    INT.   THE CORRIDOR - DAY

    Amy steps in, her way illuminated only by the indefinite
    light that leaks in from the street.

  


                                40


    There's an archway, presumably leading into the rest of the
    basement, on one side, but it's blocked by a great heap of
    rubble.

    Amy ponders the chances of getting through it, and decides to
    check out the rest of the hallway. She works her way through
    a series of ominous corridors.

    Amy senses that she is not alone, stops, and turns around. No
    one. She continues.

    There is only a single door left -- at the far end of the
    hallway. It hangs half-open, but we cannot see what's inside.
    She approaches it, reaches out and pushes the door open. It's
    a bathroom.

    As she enters we see a FIGURE beyond her in the hallways,
    buried in the shadows.

    INT. THE BATHROOM - DAY

    This is one of those nasty little makeshift places built into
    an available corner -- basically a toilet and a sink so close
    that there's hardly room to move. A mop and some other
    supplies, long forgotten, are propped up in a corner.

    Amy steps in, looks down the toilet. Nothing left but some
    nasty stains -- the water long dried up. Her face brushes
    against something hanging in the air. She pulls back. It's a
    pull string hanging from a naked light bulb.

    She tugs on it. Nothing. No power here.

    She stands in the dark, claustrophobic place, puzzled. She
    looks back down the hall. It seems as if she's come to
    another dead end. Then she stares at the bathroom door. Open
    now, it blocks a piece of the bathroom wall -- the only place
    she hasn't looked.

    Amy steps back, virtually straddling the toilet, and pushes
    the door closed. As she does, of course, what little light
    there is, vanishes completely. If there's something behind
    the door, she can't see it, or anything else.

    Abruptly, there's a sharp click as she lights her lighter,
    and the wavering light illuminates the tiny bathroom -- and
    the previously unseen space behind the door.

    The walls do not meet there. There is a narrow gap, leading
    to a passage, apparently "between" the walls, perhaps ten
    inches wide.

  

                                41



    Hesitating only a moment, Amy turns sideways and slides
    herself into the claustrophobic slot. She holds the lighter
    up ahead of her, but its dim flickering light does not reach
    to the end of the passage. She moves forward cautiously --
    the floor is littered with dried chunks of plaster, rotting
    insulation -- seventy-five years of stuff crumbled from the
    insides of the walls.

    As she disappears into the tunnel, the door slowly opens
    behind her. Passing across the rusty doorknob, a menacing
    blade appears.

    Inside the tunnel, Amy reaches a vertical pipe up against one
    side of the wall - - only a few inches thick, but it reduces
    the available room to under eight inches. She hesitates.
    Meanwhile, the lighter in her hand is getting hot. She lets
    it click off. In some dim half-light we can see her slipping
    a handkerchief carefully around it, for insulation.

    She flicks the flint. The lighter lights.

    And, abruptly, around a million roaches , which had returned
    from their hiding places in the absence of the light, go
    skittering every which way.

    Amy lets out a squeak as the roaches vanish in an instant.

                          AMY
              Christ...

    She looks at the pipe again, and then starts to squeeze past
    it. It's a tight fit. She has to squirm to get through.

                        AMY
              Welcome to club anorexia...

    She pops free and comes out the other side. She holds up the
    lighter. Still the light cannot reach to the end of the
    passage. Steeling herself, she moves on. But as she does, the
    space seems to get progressively narrower and narrower.

    From ten inches to nine, to eight, until both sides of her
    body are scraping against the walls. She holds the lighter
    out. The wall continues to narrow.

    At the end of her outstretched arm, the walls are only around
    five inches apart.

                        AMY
              What the...

 


                                 42



    Clearly, she's reached the end of the line. Annoyed, she
    starts to back out -- then realizes that the light on the far
    side of her body renders the area into which she's now moving
    essentially black as midnight.

     She brings the hand holding the lighter close in to her body,
    but she can't bring her hands together in front of her -- the
    space is too narrow. Finally, she reaches her hand up, over
    her head, passing the lighter from one hand to the other
    directly over her head.

    As she does, the lighter almost slips. She grabs for it, but
    it goes out. Again she is lost in virtual darkness.

    She strikes the flint. It flickers but doesn't light. As she
    strikes it again, IT LIGHTS SOMETHING IN THERE WITH HER! Amy
    doesn't see it, we do...

    AND IT HAS A KNIFE IN ITS HANDS.

    The light returns -- now illuminating the other side of her
    body -- the way from which she's come. But, because the space
    is so narrow, she can't turn her head towards the entrance.
    Once again, the roaches go skittering away.

    And Amy starts heading "back" from where she entered. Her
    head facing away from her progress backward, trying to
    squeeze through.

    She holds up the lighter, it lights the area "ahead" which
    she cannot see. The flickering fire exposes the figure
    awaiting her.

    The walls on this side now also seem to narrow. The space
    revealed by the light is barely as wide as her fist, and
    there is only darkness beyond. Darkness, and the figure with
    the knife. Amy senses something is wrong.

                        AMY
              What the ...

    She continues, but now she can barely move a few feet before
    the wall becomes too narrow to pass. She pushes, trying to
    shove through the narrow gap. But she cannot move. The walls
    have literally closed in, until she is now squeezed between
    them. Panic sets in.

    Gasping, Amy pushes against the wall she's facing. Trying
    desperately to turn her head around. She forces with all her
    might to turn her head, her facial features stretching almost
    comically. She finally gets it around.

  



                                43



    She is face to face with the knife as it comes RIPPING
    THROUGH FRAME, narrowly missing her arm.

    Amy screams and drops the lighter. Now in darkness, she
    scurries frantically away -- back deeper into the space.

    Amy starts struggling, panic growing on her, trying to climb,
    to crouch, to tug free in some direction, but her movement is
    very limited. The walls seem to close in on her.

    She is struggling to breathe against the pressing walls. The
    figure keeps advancing towards her.

                        AMY
              Stop! Please stop! Stop this!

    She's flailing her arms now, frantic. The knife-wielding
    figure struggles, having difficulty as well. One of Amy's
    hands flies back and hits the wall behind her.

    Now she really panics, her hands desperately scraping along
    the wall looking for anyway out. There isn't any.

    She looks back toward her attacker, who's now right on top
    of her and raising the knife for one final blow.

    Amy braces for the blade's impact as she pushes against the
    wall when suddenly she-

    Falls backward onto the floor. Her heart pounding. Her
    breathing heavy.

    She checks her arms for wounds. There aren't any.

    She looks up. The Figure is gone.

    She stands, confused, and finds herself in an empty room.
    Some discarded junk, a pile of loose plaster. She leaps
    forward, and nearly trips on a piece of rubble to get the
    hell away from the entry. Odd thing is...here is no entry.       
    She whips herself around towards the sound of someone sharply
    exhaling.

    She looks this way and that, but can't see the source of the
    sound. The attacker?

    A pale light is visible, coming from around a far corner.

    Someone steps into the light. A young BLACK KID. He holds a
    finger up to his lips.

 


                                44



                        BLACK KID
              Shhhh... follow me.

    He signals her to follow him. Amy moves cautiously forward.

    AN ADJOINING ROOM

    The walls have been partially torn down. The light comes from
    an adjoining room. Amy approaches cautiously, remaining in
    the shadows, and leans forward, staring through a gap in the
    wall into the room beyond.

    The various participants, some of whom we recognize from the
    videotape movie, are standing crowded around something on the
    floor. Amy can't see just what it is that they're staring at,
    at first, but she does see that one of the ones gathered
    there is Katya, complete with the hole in her head. She
    nervously puts a a finger into the hole and inspects the
    blood.

    The sound of the exhalations is coming from the unseen place.

    Then somebody in the circle moves, to get a better vantage
    point, and now Amy can see, clearly, what is going on.

    Winter is lying on top of the corpse of a YOUNG MAN,
    breathing into his mouth as he did with Katya. An almost
    sexual encounter yields the same results as the tape.

    He takes a final deep breath. And then, as before, the Young
    Man gasps. Winter pulls away. As he does, we can see the
    Young Man's face, smiling, despite the knife that is lodged
    into his chest. Winters grabs the knife and yanks it out.

    The others come forward, helping him up.

    Winter stands and somebody slips a robe over his body. He
    promptly looks straight at Amy, still hidden in the shadows.

                         WINTER
              I have a room of my own. Kindly join me.

    He throws the knife at the wall, where it embeds itself in
    way further then it should have, and walks away. Amy moves
    away from the opening. She circles around, through a doorway,
    and into the space that she was previously watching.

    She moves forward hesitantly, trying to avoid the touch of
    the various occupants, who don't behave aggressively, but
    clearly press forward, into her personal space.

    She looks this way and that, trying to find where Winter has
    gone.

  



                               45



    A hand comes down on her shoulder. She turns suddenly. It's
    the Black Kid. He gestures.

                        BLACK KID
              Winter's through there.

    He points toward a doorway, lost in shadow. Amy notices on
    his pointing hand that his wrists have been deeply slashed.
    She looks down to the other hand, which the kid politely
    offers for her to examine.

     Amy backs away through the crowd. Following her is the
    recently revived Young Man, who's still completely naked.
    He smiles at Amy. She moves away, and through the door to
    Winter's room.


    INT. WINTER'S ROOM - DAY

    This is a small, dark space, light coming mostly from a
    rather conventional-looking standing lamp. In the shadows
    beyond the little space of light is a confusion of half-open
    doors, walls and shadows, half lit rooms with un-guessable
    occupants.

    Winter is there, sitting in a padded chair in front of a
    coffee table, reading a book. Amy steps inside. Winter
    doesn't react to her presence. Abruptly, the door closes
    behind her. She hesitates and walks forward.

                           WINTER
              Amy Klein.

                        AMY
              You know me.

                        WINTER
              I chose you.

    Amy pauses, unsure, then moves forward and takes a seat
    opposite him.

                        AMY
              That was a hell of a way in. Makes me
              think that you don't want...

                        WINTER
              People come in here the way they want. If
              it was difficult, then that was the way
              you wanted it. A little danger. A little
              mystery. That's what you expected. That's
              what you found.

                    



                                 46



    Winters puts the book down.     His attention is now on Amy.

                        WINTER (CONT'D)
              Were you afraid, Amy? Just now? And
              during your little "rite of passage"
              through the walls?

                         AMY
              Yes. Was it real?

    Winter smiles, he displays amusement to Amy's suspicions.

                        WINTER
              And were you afraid when you saw Marla
              Chen? Of what you found in the bathroom?

                          AMY
              Yes.

                        WINTER
              You took something from her?

    Winter studies Amy.

                        WINTER (CONT'D)
              Do you have it with you?

    Amy opens her bag and produces the Puzzle Box.     She lays on
    the table between them.

                           AMY
              What is it?

                        WINTER
              My great grandfather created that box.
              He left it as a...gift. A way to cheat
              death, an entrance to everlasting
              pleasures, and it belongs to me. Though
              there are others who would disagree.

                        AMY
              Marla warned me about it, about you.

                        WINTER
              Really? Should I be honored or afraid
              that you are here, Amy Klein. Do you
              really think you can just go along with
              us for a little ride and then get off
              when it suits you? Like your new friends
              on the train? You're not going to find it
              so easy to get off this train.

 


                      47



                        AMY
              So I shouldn't get on?

                        WINTER
              Your already on it. Don't dance with me,
              Amy Klein. Don't think for a second that
              you aren't in danger. You are in more
              danger than ever imagined possible.

                        AMY
              What the hell does that mean?

    Winter leans into Amy's space.

                         INTER
              Listen to me. There are things that are
              true in the light of day. There are other
              things that are no less true, that live
              in the shadows. When you shine a light on
              them, they disappear. They stop being
              true. That's because it is the
              uncertainty of the dark that makes them
              possible. If the dark is deep enough...
              anything might be happening in it.
              Anything at all. I'm one of those things.

                         AMY
              What happened to Marla Chen? What did you
              do to her?

    He stands and walks away from Amy.

                         INTER
              Marla? Why, I accepted her, that's all.
              That's all I've ever done for the people
              who come to me.

                        AMY
              She didn't want to become one of you,
              whatever the hell you are. That's why she
              killed herself.

                        WINTER
              Oh, but she did. And what makes you so
              sure she's dead?

     Winters studies Amy face.

                         INTER (CONT'D)
              We all die, over and over and over again.
              Marla can't commit suicide. All she can
              do is stop believing that she's alive.
              And she can't even do that.

                               48

                           WINTER(cont'd)
                 The more she doubts, the deader she
                 becomes. But she'll never really die,
                 because she's not really alive.

                           AMY
                 That doesn't mean anything. What I saw in
                 that room was real. What I smelled was
                 real. Real like this table.

    She raps on the table with her middle finger, palm up. She
    then lifts her hand up keeping her middle finger towards
    Winter.

                           AMY
                 Real like, like this hand...

    In a flash, almost supernaturally , Winter passes seemingly
    through the chair and is front of Amy, her hand held tightly
    by his. He reaches up with his other hand and uncurls Amy's
    fingers.

                           WINTER
                 You say this is real?

    He begins to move his fingers over her hand, enumerating the
    various parts.

                           WINTER
                 Epidermis. The dorsal fascia. Transverse
                 carpal ligament across here...

    The process is taking on an oddly seductive quality.

                           WINTER
                 The median nerve underneath it. Down
                 here, the carpal bones... And do you
                 think that all those parts are what makes
                 a hand? I'll show you what makes a
                 hand... here...

    He begins to move his fingers through the spaces in between
    her fingers. Amy is frozen still.

    FLASHBACK:


    INT. ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

    CLOSE ON A DOOR being unlocked. We recognize it from the
    opening montage. Slowly, it is pulled open to reveal:

    A LITTLE GIRL standing there - frightened.

                                   49




    INT. WINTER'S ROOM - DAY

    BACK TO SCENE.

                           WINTER (CONT'D)
                 These spaces. That what makes a hand. You
                 get it by taking things away. You, Amy
                 Klein, are the infinitesimal speck that's
                 left when we subtract the infinite
                 possibilities that the space you occupy
                 might have held.

    FLASHBACK:


    INT. HALLWAY - DAY(FLASHBACK)

    The LITTLE GIRL kicking and screaming. She is pulled out of
    the closet. We never get a clear view of THE MAN, but we know
    he is pure evil.


    INT. WINTER'S ROOM - DAY

    BACK TO SCENE.

    Close on Amy's hand, trembling in Winter's grip.

                           WINTER (CONT'D)
                     (referring to her hand)
                 This thing here isn't a presence. It's an
                 absence. It's a place where things are
                 missing. In all essential qualities, it
                 is less than nothing. In all essential
                 qualities, we are less than nothing. Not
                 solid, not here, not real.

    Amy finds herself responding, falling under his spell.

    Flashback:


    INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

    The LITTLE GIRL is picked up under THE MAN'S arm, and pulled
    away. His groping hands move seductively, and violently. She

                                50




    INT. DEADER'S DUNGEON - DAY

    Amy awakens from the trance. She is lying down surrounded by
    the Deaders. Winters stands above her.

                        WINTER
              What did you see?

                         AMY
              Nothing.

                         INTER
              What are you afraid of, Amy?

                        AMY
              I'm not afraid of you.

                         WINTER
              Yes you are, but still you can't run --
              you won't run.
                  (studies her)
              I wonder why that is?
                  (beat)
              I'm no devil. I'm no monster. Amy, I'll
              never hurt you and I'll never leave you.

    Amy doesn't answer. Winter extends to her a knife.

                        WINTER (cont'd)
              Accept my gift. No more fear. No more
              questions. No one can ever hurt you
              again.

    For a moment she appears to consider his offering. Then, as
    if waking up... she shoves herself back away from Winter.

                         AMY
              No, get... get away...

    But now the Dead are there, surrounding her, reaching out for
    her. They begin to chant.

    Winter takes the PUZZLE BOX and places on a makeshift altar
    at the head of the mattress.

                        DEADERS
                  (reciting)
              My skin isn't real. My eyes aren't real.
              My muscles aren't real. My bones, my
              heart, my veins and nerves, and flesh and
              meat... aren't real-

 


                               51



                        WINTER
              Lie down Amy. It'll only hurt for a
              second. I promise.

                        AMY
              You're crazy.

                        DEADERS
              - What I see, what I hear, what I taste,
              what I touch, what I remember, what I
              think, what I feel, aren't real.

                        WINTER
              No more pain. Only pleasure.

    The Deaders start to grab onto her. She starts to panic a
    little.



                         AMY (cont'd)
              No!

    She fights her way from the group and...


    INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

    Amy SMASHES THROUGH a vertical plane of safety glass,
    smashing it into a thousand tiny fragments as she goes
    crashing back, through it...

    Her head hits hard against a tile wall and she goes sliding
    down, in the dark, her hand scrambling for something to hold
    onto.

    Her reaching hand grabs some metal handle. She pulls... and
    abruptly, water begins to cascade down onto her face.

    She turns herself sideways and rolls over, gasping. She's in
    a bathtub... in fact she's just been thrown through the
    safety-glass door. She scrambles over the bottom edge of the
    sliding glass door, scraping herself across the tiny pegs of
    glass that still line the border of the frame.

    She pulls herself up, her hand feeling for a light switch...
    Finally, she finds it, flips the switch.

    She's in the hotel bathroom, slumped over against the sink.
    Soaking wet, scratched, shaking, gasping, she stares at
    herself in the mirror.

  


                                52



    There's a tiny square of glass stuck into her shoulder. She
    tugs it loose. It clinks as she drops it into the sink.

                         AMY
              It's not real... it's not real...

    She lifts her hand to wipe the wet hair from her face... then
    pauses. She turns toward the bathtub. She reaches through the
    shattered door and turns off the shower.


    INT. AMY'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

    THE PHONE RINGS. She snatches it out of its cradle.

                         AMY
              Hello.

                        CHARLES
                  (through phone)
              Amy it's Charles, I know it's not too
              late.

                        AMY
              You just can't go too long without
              hearing my voice.

                        CHARLES
              Guilty. Look, Amy, I've been thinking
              about the story about what happened,
              maybe this isn't for you.

    Amy grabs the PUZZLE BOX off the table. She spins it in her
    hands.

                        AMY
              Charles, you know I value your opinion-

                        CHARLES
              - she said with condescension-

                        AMY
              - but if there was ever a story I was
              born to write, this is it.

                        CHARLES
              I think it's too dangerous, for a lot of
              reasons.

                        AMY
              This isn't like you.

                                   53



                           CHARLES
                 I know. I'm going to hate myself in the
                 morning.

                           AMY
                 I'm just a little... fucked in the head.
                 That's all. It's just a funk, but I'm
                 fine. All I need is some sleep.

                           CHARLES
                 OK. I just thought I'd put it out there
                 to see if you'd bite. I should've known
                 better. It goes against my instincts.
                           A
                            MY
                 That's what I love about you. I'll call
                 you tomorrow.
                     (beat)

                 Hey, Charles, did you know that the word
                 "demon" comes from the Greek word for
                 knowledge.

                           CHARLES
                 Yes I believe I've heard that somewhere
                 before.

                           AMY
                 Well, I wish somebody had told me about
                 it.

    She hangs up, and shuts off a light on her way to bed.

    FLASHBACK:


    INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

    CLOSE ON the LITTLE GIRL slung under THE MAN'S arm, as he
    carried her down the hall. She's scraping at the walls, the
    door jams, anything to try to free herself from him.

    Her hand sweeps across a small table at the end of the hall,
    smashing over a GLASS VASE.

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:


    INT.   AMY'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

    The room is dark, drained of all color the way things appear
    when we see in them in almost total darkness.

  



                                54


    Amy's lying in bed on her stomach. The sheet has crumpled off
    of her. She's dressed only in her panties.

    Abruptly, there's the sound of a wettish "thud" and Amy seems
    to bounce a little. Her eyes open, but she isn't alarmed.
    Still lying on her back, she flicks her eyes this way and
    that, but, seeing nothing, she closes them again.

    A few seconds later, we see some black liquid trickle across
    her shoulder, coming from the unseen center of her back . It
    follows a course down her backbone, then swerves and finds a
    path along the inner edge of one of her shoulder blades,
    finally trickling down her neck. It continues to flow,
    staining the pillow by her face.

    She stirs slightly, clearly feeling the trickle. She puts her
    hand to her shoulder, smearing the black liquid. Still half-
    asleep, she tries to "brush" it off... but it continues to
    flow. Finally, her eyes open. She sits up painfully and looks
    at her hands -- stained with this sticky black stuff. She
    stares at it, not quite awake enough to figure it out.

    She reaches over her shoulder, pulls her hand back, stained
    with the black stuff. She looks down at her pillow, also
    stained. Confused, she rises, painfully awkward, and heads
    toward the bathroom. We can see that her feet leave blackish
    wet footprints across the floor as she moves toward the
    bathroom.


    INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

    She moves in, stares in the mirror -- sees the side of her
    face and her shoulder, smeared with black. She fumbles for
    the light, flips it on.

     In the sudden, shocking glare of returning light, COLOR
    abruptly re-enters the world... And the black of the liquid
    that's stained Amy's face and hands, that track the floor of
    the white-tiled bathroom, that smear the wall where she
    flipped on the light switch turns instantly to its true color
    --
    The color of blood.

    Amy gasps at the sight -- she looks like she's just crawled
    out of a slaughterhouse. She reaches behind her, feeling her
    back, trying to find the source of the blood that seems to be
    pouring out of her, dripping to the floor, pouring down the
    small of her back, staining the back of her panties a vivid,
    ghastly red.

  


                                55



    In a sudden impulse she turns on the water in the sink full
    blast, washes away the blood from her hands, scooping
    handfuls onto her face and the front of her body. The water
    drips to the floor, commingling with the blood, turning it a
    nasty pink.

    She reaches behind her back, feeling again -- her hand comes
    back as vividly red as before. Again she washes them. She
    stops dead, seeing something in the mirror.

    Something is glinting between her breasts. She touches her
    finger to it. It looks like a tiny bit of gleaming metal,
    poking out from inside of her, almost like a tiny steel
    splinter. It appears to have just barely broken through the
    skin from "inside" -- barely a drop of blood.

    She stands staring down at it, breathing fast. What the hell
    is it?

    Then, slowly, almost against her will, she turns her back to
    the mirror and looks over her shoulder. She sees -- and we
    see for the first time -- the center of her back where her
    questing hands couldn't reach.

    There is a knife there, literally thrust through the middle
    of her back. The gleaming splinter between her breasts is the
    tip of the knife that has literally transfixed her -- and
    clearly transfixed the center of her chest -- her heart.

    She strains her hands back, trying to reach this impossible
    thing, but her grasping fingers can't touch it. She turns
    back toward the mirror, staring into her own eyes.

                         AMY
              It's not real... it's not real.

    She clenches her eyes... opens them. Her fingers feel
    desperately for the metal tip between her breasts. It's still
    there.

                        AMY
              Wake up... wake up... wake up...

    She starts slapping her hands against the side of her face --
    not gently, hard slaps. But she isn't "waking up." She grabs
    her hair, pulls hard. Nothing. She's still there. The knife
    is still stuck, impossibly in her back.

    She sits on the closed seat of the toilet... not knowing what
    to do. She reaches again for the knife, but she can't touch
    it. She buries her face in her bloody hands.

  


                                56



                          AMY
                I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming...
                    (screams)
                I'M DREAMING!

    She stands, turns this way and that, not knowing what to do.
    She looks around her bathroom, searching for something. She
    tugs open the medicine cabinet, searches beneath the sink,
    tugging the various stuff out. Whatever it is that she's
    looking for, she can't find it.

    She spins back to the mirror. Opens it. Slips back against it
    wedging the knife handle between the door and the medicine
    cabinet.

    Holding one hand against the mirror, she starts to push away,
    wincing in pain.

    We can see the tiny silver tip between her breasts vanish
    from view, drawn back inside her body . Slowly, making a
    wet, sticky sound, the long thin knife begins to slide out.

    With a gasp she heaves out... and the knife goes flying. It
    bounces on the floor, splattering blood. With shaking hands,
    Amy bends over and picks it up. She stands, staring at it.
    It's some kind of nasty stiletto. Amy stands, staring at it.

    A FLASHBACK

    Amy searching Marla's drawers, tugging one open -- pressing
    the stud on a stiletto. ON THIS STILETTO.


    INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

    She looks down toward the floor. She is literally standing in
    a pool of her own blood. She gasps, turns back toward the
    mirror.

    Blood is pouring from the wound. Gasping, almost crying, Amy
    stumbles back into the main room. With shaky hands, she picks
    up the phone, then realizes that she's still holding the
    stiletto in her hand. She drops it on the table. Her bloody
    fingers press in the numbers -- 9-9-9 (emergency).

    She waits, standing in the middle of her dark hotel room,
    shaking, bloody. She can hear the phone ring and ring.

    Finally, there's a click as the line picks up. But there's no
    voice on the other end.

                          AMY
                Hello, hello? Hello? Is there anyb...

                               57



    Then she stops dead. There is somebody there, and making a
    sound we've heard before. The nasty gurgling that Amy heard
    when she tried calling Marla's room.

                        MARLA
                  (through phone)
              Only he can bring you back.

    She slams the phone down, tears the cord from the wall. As
    she turns to fling it she hears the sound of a man speaking.

    She turns at the sound.

    PINHEAD is standing across the room from her, reading from
    one of the books on a tiny bookshelf in the corner.

                        PINHEAD
                  (reading)
              "--to all of us - there comes the closing
              of the doors - the entrances - the exits -
              so that one may pass no more out or
              in..."

    He closes the book, turns toward her.

                        PINHEAD
              Walt Whitman. I like your taste in books.

                        AMY
              Came with the room. Along with the
              uncomfortable couch.

    Amy puts the phone back on the table.

                        AMY
              Who are you? Why did you do this to me?

                        PINHEAD
              I didn't. Believe me, when I want to hurt
              you, it will be more than a scratch.

                        AMY
              Then why the hell are you here? Why are
              you in my room?

                        PINHEAD
              This isn't your room. It's mine...

                         AMY
              What...

                               58



                        PINHEAD
              This is my room, my building, my
              street... my world. You still can't
              believe that you're in the "real" world,
              can you? I mean... you've just had a
              A knife run through you. Shouldn't it hurt?

                         AMY
              It's a dream. I'm dreaming...

                        PINHEAD
              No. Dreams come to an end. Nightmares are
              forever.

    He approaches her. She backs away.

                        PINHEAD
              You've been recruited as a soldier in
              another man's war. A war he will never
              win, that I can assure you.

                        AMY
              I don't know what you're talking about.

                        PINHEAD
              You will. Soon enough. But one shouldn't
              worship false Gods. Especially when that
              false God is themselves.

                        AMY
              I'm not a believer.  
                                 
                        PINHEAD
              Oh you will. Tell me, do you believe in               
              Hell?

    Looks down at the blade jutting out from her chest.

                        AMY
              Starting to.

                        PINHEAD
              You opened a door. He pulled you in. But              
              the only way out -- is through me.

    He steps towards her.

    She grabs up the phone, flings it. It hits the far wall and
    falls to the floor. Winter's gone. She reaches a hand behind
    her, to her back, brings it back, red with blood.

   


                                59




    A MOMENT LATER

    We see Amy rolling a towel up into a tight cylinder. Hands
    trembling, she lays it across a wide strip of duct tape that
    she's unwound from a roll and laid down on the table, sticky
    side up.

     She presses the towel down so that it sticks, then picks up
    the tape, with towel attached. She slides the towel down the
    center of her back until it covers the wound, and then tugs
    the tape tight across her chest, compressing the towel
    against the wound.

    She takes the tape and awkwardly loops it around the towel
    and herself a couple more times, finally biting through the
    tape and tossing the roll away. She yanks yesterday's clothes
    up, discards the skirt in favor of a pair of black jeans.

    She tugs them up over her bloody legs, pulls a black shirt on
    over her top, thrusts her bloody feet into a pair of heavy
    shoes and finally tugs on a black leather jacket.

    She goes to the mirror, turns, trying to see how her profile
    looks with the towel stuffed in her back.

    She turns, about to leave... then realizes that her hands are
    red with her own blood. She hurries to the sink, rinses them
    off, and rinses the blood off of her face and neck, then
    grabs her bag and heads out the door.


    EXT. AMY'S HOTEL - NIGHT

    Amy comes unsteadily down out of her Hotel.


    EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT

    More shadows than light.

    She comes around a corner and onto a narrow street, moving
    fast, her feet making loud echoey clip-clops on the street.

    There's a bum, dressed in rags, leaning up against the wall
    of a building.

    As she approaches him, he stirs slightly. Then she looks more
    closely.

    The man is eating something very crunchy. He stares at her
    blankly as he picks crickets off the wall and devours them,
    one by one. He offers her one, and smiles.

  



                                60



    Amy leaps back, turns and runs. Some distance down the
    street, there seems to be a flicker of light, a trace of
    noise.

    She scrambles toward it. It's coming up from a subway grate.
    She throws herself down on it.

    Down below she can hear the roar of a subway train passing
    below. Indirect, flickering light shines up from below.

    She looks up. There's a subway entrance. She hurries toward
    it.


    INT. TOKEN BOOTH - NIGHT

    Amy comes down the stairs. No sign of life. The fluorescent
    lights flicker - some dead. Amy fumbles for her metro card.
    This is one of those unattended entrances with entry through
    the top-to-bottom turnstiles.

    She starts through the turnstile. Then with a squeak, it
    sticks and she finds herself stuck half-way through, unable
    to move forward or backward. She tries to back out, but the
    thing won't turn in that direction. She heaves forward. It
    finally gives way. She looks this way and that, back through
    the turnstile, she sees her bloody footprints leading all the
    way through.

    Amy hears footsteps echoing towards her. Through a large
    mirror at an intersection, she sees the source of the
    footsteps. A cop on the beat.

    Amy looks down and sees she is standing in a pool of her own
    blood. The footsteps get louder.

    She sees a stack of newspapers next to her on a stand. She
    grabs one and throws it down in front of herself to cover the
    blood. It soaks threw in no time. The Cop is nearing the
    corner. She grabs another, then another, and throws them
    down. The pool of her blood leaks from under them all. The
    cop rounds the corner, he has a baton he taps against his
    leg.

    Amy grabs the whole stand and tips it over. With a loud
    SMASH, it spills the newspaper everywhere. As the cop walks
    in front of Amy, the blood is hidden beneath the pile of
    newspapers. Amy bends down to attend to the mess.

    She makes eyes with the Cop and shrugs her shoulders at her
    "mistake". The Cop smiles and nods, and keeps on walking.
    The sound of his footsteps vanish down the corridors.

 


                                61



    Amy collects herself with a few deep breaths, and moves on
    towards the platform.


    INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT

    Amy stands on the platform as a train whooshes into the
    station at HYPER-SPEED then stops instantly in front of her.

    The doors hiss open and Amy is greeted by the tall Odd-
    looking Conductor. She pushes past him.


    INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

    The train lurches forward as Amy makes her way through the
    usual crowd of CELEBRANTS.

    She finds Joey sitting court in the middle of the train car.
    He's wearing a pair of terminator sunglasses.

    Amy approaches. His face seems sickly pale in the flashing
    light.

    He moves abruptly, a slight turn of the head -- toward her.

                        JOEY
              Well look who's back. What now?

                        AMY
              I need... please... please help me.

                        JOEY
              Help you with what?

    Amy hesitates an instant, then tugs open her shirt, revealing
    the gaffer's tape that holds the rolled-up towel to her back.
    She works at it. Finally, it tears. She tears it straight
    down the front of her chest as Joey watches, passive.

    Her chest is stained with blood. She licks her fingers and
    wipes the blood away from the middle of her chest. Joey's
    eyes narrow. He leans forward to study it. He leans in
    closer, hesitates, then leans back, looking Amy in the eye.

                        JOEY
              Wow, are those real?  
                                 
    Amy doesn't react.

                       

                                62



                        JOEY
              Okay, you're not in the mood for my light-
              hearted banter. What the hell, this isn't
              my idea of paradise either.

                        AMY
              I don't understand. Why aren't I dead? Or
              am I? Please...

                        JOEY
              Life, death, they're not all that
              different, really. You can find your
              death in your life. You can find your
              life in your death. Round and round and
              round you go.

                         AMY
              Please, help me.

                        JOEY
              I am helping you.

                         AMY
              Then explain what the hell is going on.
              Why did I have a knife buried in my back?
              Why am I seeing dead people walking
              around? Why is there a guy with Pins in
              his head stopping by in the middle of the
              night for a chat.

    She gets in his face.

                        AMY
              Why am I not DEAD!

    There's a jolt as the train starts to pull into the station.
    The light from the station begins to illuminate the inside of
    the car more clearly. Joey leans back from her.

                         JOEY
              Whoa. It's time to give in Amy, you're
              just fighting it too hard. Forget about
              the truth, forget about reality, just sit
              back and enjoy the ride. There's nothing
              you can do anyway. We're all just piece's
              in Winter's little puzzle.

                         AMY
              The box.

                        JOEY
              You're willing to do anything to find the
              truth.
                        (MORE)

  


                                63


                         JOEY(cont'd)
              That's what I find most attractive about
              you. Well, that and the fact that you
              have a great ass. You and I are the same
              really, we're both willing to take it as
              far as it will go, to the edge, to the
              extreme.

                  (beat)

              You know what our biggest problem is Amy
              Klein? Neither of us know when to get off
              the God damn train.

    The train jerks to a stop, tossing Amy a little. She regains
    her footage and turns back to Joey but in the flickering
    fluorescent light, Joey's skin suddenly looks sickly pale.

                         AMY
              Joey?

    He doesn't answer. He doesn't move.

                        AMY
              Joey come on. Let's get off the train.
              Right now, you and me.

    He still doesn't move. Amy reaches out a shaky hand and takes
    his glasses off.

                        AMY
                  (voice trailing off)
              You and me...

    Joey's eyes are empty, glazed. He's dead. Not only is he
    dead, it's clear that he's been dead for awhile.

    Then she freezes when she realizes the sound has completely
    dropped out around her.

    All she can hear is her heart beating.

    She slowly turns around to find that all of Joey's Celebrants
    on the train are also dead and surrounded by the familiar
    buzz of flies.

    Some of the dead are hung from the hand rails by HOOKS AND
    CHAINS, their throats slashed, eyes gouged, bullet holes in
    the head, etc...

    A large female cenobite is sewing the filleted skin from one     
    Deaders throat open to reveal his vocal chords. He makes a       
    sound at Amy and his chords vibrate.                             
    But there's this one COKE HEAD GUY who was snorting a line
    when Amy got on the train.

                                64



    He looks normal as he snorts up the last rail off his hand-
    held mirror.

    She studies him for a moment when suddenly he turns to her
    and we get a good look at his FACE.

    The entire left side of his face has rotted away and we can
    see the powdery coke lining his decaying left nostril.

                        COKE-HEAD GUY
              Looks like the party's over.

    Suddenly all she can her is the LOUD ROAR OF THE TRAIN.

    Amy stumbles back, turns to run into the next train car and
    smacks right into-

    MARLA CHEN. A horribly decaying Marla Chen.

    At first Amy is confused but then something clicks behind her
    eyes as she shoves Marla back down the train car.

                        AMY
                  (screams)
              Why did you do this to me?

    The trains screeches into the station and the doors HISS
    OPEN.

                        MARLA
              We have to go...

                           AMY
                     (louder)
              Why?

                        MARLA
              I didn't have any other choice.

    Amy looks down at her shirt as BLOOD begins to soak through
    it.

                        AMY
              What's happening to me?

                         MARLA
              You're dying.
                  (beat)
              Like me.

    Marla grabs her hand and starts to pull her along.

                               65



                        MARLA
              Please. We've got to go!

                         AMY
              Where?

                        MARLA
              That's for you to decide.

    Amy looks around the platform, as if deciding what to do.
    There's a little panic in Marla's voice.

                        MARLA
              You see, that's the problem right there.
              I'm supposed to help you. Like... Like
              Winter helped me. But I don't know if I
              can.

                        AMY
              Then why are you here?

                        MARLA
              To try... Because I have no other choice.
              No turning back now-
                  (re:how she looks)
              Know what I mean?

                         AMY
              No, I don't. I don't know one God damn
              thing anymore.
                  (beat)
              I just want to go home.

    Marla gives her a comforting smile.

                        MARLA
              Then let's go home.

    They jump down to an abandoned track and head into the
    darkness.


    INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

    A strange twisting tunnel with eerie blue lights. Pipes
    running along the ceiling, dripping water and hissing steam.

    Amy and Marla march quickly towards camera.


                        AMY
              Marla what... what happened to you?

 


                            66



                        MARLA
              I put my head through a noose and I
              jumped ten feet down. They cut me down,
              and Winter breathed into me, and I was
              alive. And everybody was happy... and
              like, congratulating me...

    Marla's eyes are wet with yellowish tears.

                         MARLA
              And for a while, it was great. But it's
              like being a tightrope walker... you're
              walking along on this rope, and then all
              of a sudden, it's like you realize -- I'm
              walking on a rope a hundred feet up in
              the air. And that's when you fall.
                  (
                    struggles to control herself)
              I tried to end it. That's when you found           
              me.                                                
                        AMY                                      
              Why are you doing this? Why am I here? 
            
                        MARLA                                    
              For the reward from it all.                        

    The tunnel starts to take some weird twists and turns.

    They stop and Marla turns amy in her direction. The place
    starts to tremble, a train is approaching from far off.

                        MARLA
              But it isn't enough for somebody else to
              stick a knife into you. You have to come
              to the point where you can do it to
              yourself -- that's the acceptance. The
              final preparation before you give your
              soul to it. Willingly.

                        AMY
              But why? What it is all for?

                        MARLA
              That's the missing link. That part he
              keeps to himself. But he promises an
              eternal paradise filled with the ultimate
              pleasures. We just can't be afraid. And
              we can't have any doubts.
                  (introspective)
              Guess I screwed up on that part.

   


                                67



    The tunnel is narrowing, the train is right around the bend.
    Amy turns to the sound of the rumbling train.

                        MARLA
              Fear is where you go to learn.

    Amy spins back to her. "Huh?"

                        MARLA
              Sorry. I told you there's no turning back
              Amy. Only he can bring you back.

    Amy's attention is on the train, it roars in at full
    throttle.

                         WINTER
              AMY!

    Amy turns around just as the train is about to run through
    them to find WINTER, arms open for her.

                        WINTER
              (screaming over the train)
              All roads lead home.


    INT. A BED - DAY

    Amy's eyes abruptly pop open.

    She's lying on a white pillow, with white sheets tucked up
    over her. She turns her eyes to one side. There's a hospital
    curtain, the kind on a railing, pulled closed around her. She
    looks down.

    She's lying in a hospital bed. She tries to move, but she
    realizes her hands and legs are tied to the bed by large
    leather straps. Charles is there, in a chair, watching her.

                        CHARLES
              Good morning.

    He takes a sip of coffee. She struggles with the straps.

                        CHARLES
              Amy don't fight it, it's only going to
              make things worse.

    Her eyes dart around the room in a panic.

                        AMY
              What the hell happened?

                                68



                        CHARLES
              I didn't hear from you. I went over to
              your hotel. You were lying on the
              floor... covered in every kind of stuff
              that can come out of a human body...

    She remembers.

                        AMY
              The blood...

    Amy looks down at her gown, expecting a large red stain, but
    there's no blood.    

                        CHARLES
              Okay. Every other kind.

                        AMY
              I don't... I mean I didn't...

                        CHARLES
              You were sort of... having a psychotic
              episode, sweets. Major mental blow-out.
              And frankly, it's about time. Jesus you
              were tied down for a day and half.
                  (off her look)
              Listen, I'm trying to get you out of
              here, back to London, but with the damage
              to your hotel room... They're not going
              to be so quick to let you go.

    Amy takes a look around the psych ward. PATIENTS walking
    aimlessly, mumbling to themselves, arguing with unseen
    opponents, rocking back and forth in catatonic states.

                        CHARLES
              Look, Amy, you probably won't have to
              stay...

    Amy feels a sudden rush of relief. A little nervous laughter.

                        AMY
              Hey, Charles, Charles... this is the best
              news I've had in a long time.

                        CHARLES
              Well, there you go. A whole new
              definition of optimism.

                        AMY
              What about Marla Chen? The story?

                                69



                        CHARLES
              They found her dead in her room. She hung
              herself.

                        AMY
              They found her. You mean the police?

                        CHARLES
              Yeah. She'd been there awhile. Probably
              did it right after she sent us the tape.

                        AMY
              Where is she?

                        CHARLES
              Jesus, I don't know. Does it matter?

                        AMY
              No, I guess not.

                        CHARLES
              But this is a good story too. Call it,
              "My Psychotic Episode" -- or, wait, maybe
              "Psychotic - Episode One." Or "Psychotic
              Pilot Episode." You know, some play on
              words with episode.
                  (looks around)
              Look, there's a lot of raw material
              around here. Emphasis on the word "raw."
              Maybe they'll let you use a felt-tip pen
              or something to take notes.

    Somebody pulls the curtain aside. It's an ORDERLY. His name
    tag identifies him as M. KIRCHER. This guy's a little out
    there, like maybe he's been dipping into the medicine cabinet
    a little too much. His eyes nervously scan the room, like
    somebody's watching him.

                         KIRCHER
              Well look who's back. How we feelin?

    She motions to the straps.

                         AMY
              Trapped.

                        KIRCHER
              Sorry. They're for your own protection.
              The way you were flailing around when
              they brought you in -- somebody was bound
              to get hurt.
                  (he chuckles to himself)
              Get it. BOUND to get hurt.

                                70



    Amy doesn't laugh. Doesn't even crack a smile.

                        AMY
              Don't quit your day job.

                        CHARLES
                  (to Kircher)
              What's say we lose the charm bracelets
              for now?
                  (turns to Amy)
              Unless of course you somehow find all of
              this -- stimulating.

                        AMY
              Don't drag me into your fantasies
              Charles.
                  (to Kircher)
              Please.                                                

    Kircher obliges and scribbles something on a folder at the       
    end of the bed. Charles leans over, gives her a little peck      
    on the cheek. As he does, he whispers to her.

                         CHARLES
                  (whispering)
              I'll see about getting a camera in
              here...

    He stands, winks at her.

                         CHARLES
              Feel better.
                  (beat)
              When you get a chance, check out the
              public area. It's a swinging place. I
              mean, like, they're literally...
              swinging.

    He heads out. Amy watches him go. She waits a beat, and then
    hops out of bed. She looks around for Nurses and Orderlies
    but there's no one around. She exits frame.


    INT. PSYCH WARD/COMMON AREA - DAY

    Blank walls lit with flickering fluorescent lighting. There's
    a TV hanging from ceiling in the corner showing TIME-LAPSE
    PHOTOGRAPHY of a blooming rose (a little homage to the
    original Hellraiser.)

    We move to find a various assortment of PATIENTS, but none of
    them are watching the TV, they're too busy entertaining
    themselves and their invisible friends.

                                71



    Amy enters cautiously, feeling a little threatened by the
    other patients. She looks around, not sure where she should
    plant herself and then she sees her-

    A LITTLE GIRL (age 6) sitting off by herself in the corner of
    the room drawing pictures. A few of them (a half human/half
    monster clawing at a closet door, a child screaming, a child
    running from the monster, a child holding a butcher knife,
    etc.) are taped on the wall behind her.

    Amy walks over to her. There's just something about her.

                        AMY
              Mind if I join you?

                        LITTLE GIRL
              Please. I'm drawing pictures.

                        AMY
              I can see that, they're lovely.

                        LITTLE GIRL
              Want me to draw your picture?

                        AMY
              I'd like that very much.

    The Little Girl stares at Amy and focuses in on her features.
    We can't see what she's drawing as her little hand starts to
    move across the sketch pad.

    But there's something a little off. Her hand doesn't move
    like a six-year-old would draw, it moves with the confidence
    and control of an adult's.

    Amy tries to get a glance at the portrait. The Little Girl
    pulls it close to her.

                        LITTLE GIRL
              No peaking.

                        AMY
              I'm sorry, you're right.

    With a few more strokes the drawing is complete. The Little
    girl studies it, pleased with herself.

    She spins it so Amy -- but not the audience -- can see it.

    CLOSE ON AMY -- her eyes wide with terror.

                        LITTLE GIRL
              What do you think?

                                72



    AMY'S POV as we get our first good look at it.

    It's Amy's face as a CENOBITE, twisted and stretched in a way
    that begins to reveal the skull around her DARK EMPTY EYES.

    There's also that nasty knife wound in the center of her
    chest with hooks stretching the skin back and to the side.

                        LITTLE GIRL (O.C.)
              I only draw what I see... Amy.

    Amy backs away from her, trembling.

                        AMY
              How do you know my name?

    The Little Girl giggles. Amy turns to the other drawings that
    the Little Girl has taped to the walls.
    T
     hey too now all look like Cenobites, some look like Deaders,
    one looks just like WINTER...

                        AMY
              No... this isn't happening.

    Amy gets up to run but then she freezes when she sees-

    MARLA sitting on the opposite side of the room. But here's
    the thing. She looks fine.

    Amy walks over, hesitant, confused.

                         AMY
              Marla?

    Marla doesn't seem to recognize her.

                         AMY (CONT'D)

              Marla! You're alive.

                        MARLA
              You say that like it's a good thing.

    Marla takes a long quiet look around the room and then leans
    in close, unable to keep up her charade.

                        MARLA
                  (whispers)
              You know he's watching us.

                         AMY
              Who?

                                                                




    S




                           73



                        MARLA
              Winter. This is where he sends all the
              trouble makers. Tries to show us who's
              boss. Tries to make us believe.

                        AMY
              So it is real?

                        MARLA
              As real as you want it to be. We all have
              our own version of the truth, some are
              just more screwed up than others. But you
              wouldn't know that, because you still
              don't know the truth.

                        AMY
              I don't understand.

                        MARLA
              You will. You see that's the point. All
              this, "Deaders", "Cenobites", whatever
              you want to call it, it's all about
              solving the puzzle. Part of that puzzle
              is you. Finding the secrets that are
              hidden within you.

    Marla pokes a finger at Amy's heart. Right on her wound.

                        MARLA
              - in there. And as soon as you find that,
              as soon as you face it, you'll be free.
              Once and for all.

     he pulls back into her chair.

                        MARLA (CONT'D)
              Me -- I'm still looking.
                        A
                         MY
              But what is it all for?

                        MARLA
              Ultimate pleasure -- more than anyone,
              even those who have solved the puzzle
              before us, have ever known. Conditions of         
              the nerve endings the likes of which your         
              imagination could not hope to evoke.              
    Marla stares at Amy deeply. The breaks into a smile.

                        MARLA                                   
              ...at Least that's what they say.                 

 



                               74



    Marla looks around the room to see if anyone is watching her    
    and then she takes Amy's hand and leans in close.  
             
                         MARLA                                      
              Problem is Winter can't solve the puzzle.
              Only a few chosen ones -- with just the
              right amount of depravity and loneliness
              in their soul -- can.
                   beat)
              So he's been on this quest for years,
              searching for that mythical person who is
              both willing to join us and can also
              solve the puzzle. And it would seem, Amy
              Klein, that that person is-

                         AMY
              Me.

                        MARLA
              Bingo baby. Sorry.

    She's trying to give Amy a clue without tipping off anyone
    who might be watching her.

                        MARLA
              He has to be there for you Amy. And he
              will be. Like he was for all of us.
              That's the key. Without him, you can't
              come back. It's you he wants. Its you he
              needs. Remember that above all.

    Marla looks down at Amy's chest. Amy follows her stare to
    find blood starting to soak through her hospital gown. Amy's
    eyes begin to glaze over.

                        MARLA
              Looks like you're running out of time.

    Amy leaps up from the table and suddenly Marla is gone. In
    fact the whole room is empty and dead quiet. A pool of blood    
    lies beneath her seat. She staggers a bit as she moves          
    forward.                                                        

    INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

    The main corridor. It seems to go on forever.

    Amy turns back to the common area. Empty.

    The she hears the familiar sound of A LITTLE GIRL SCREAMING.
    It's faint and echoing.

                               75



    Amy turns back down the corridor to the Little Girl's voice.

                           MARLA (V.O.)
                 It's all about finding the truth...

    Amy starts to slowly make her way down the long cold
    corridor.

    With each step she takes, the walls of the corridor become
    whiter, slowly bleaching out. She looks below her and sees
    the blood now draining from the wound.

    She stumbles back slowly and turns as the LITTLE GIRL'S
    SCREAMS continue.

    Then she hears the BANGING and RATTLING of a door. Like
    someone's fighting to get out.

    FLASHBACK:


    INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

    AMY'S FATHER half walking, half stumbling out of one of the
    rooms at the far end of the corridor. He's dressed in a
    stained white tank top shirt, his eyes glazed and distant.

    He's knows the source of the noise -- and he's pissed.


    INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

    Back to scene.

    Amy keeps stumbling down the corridor.

    FLASHBACK:


    INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

    Now Amy is within the flashback. She looks good, no blood,
    almost peaceful. Her father looks down the corridor toward
    Amy, but doesn't seem to see her. He turns and storms off in
    the opposite direction.

    Amy can't believe what she's seeing, but she can't help
    herself. She follows him.


    INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

    Back to scene.

                                76



    Amy is stumbling more than walking as she grows weaker with
    every step. Her eyes begin to glaze over and her vision is
    beginning to blur.

    She looks down to find the trail of BRIGHT RED BLOOD trailing
    behind her on the otherwise PURE-WHITE floor.

    When she looks back up she finds herself in-

    FLASHBACK:


    INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

    The hallway from Amy's childhood home. Her Father is now only
    a few steps in front of Amy as he reaches the door to his
    office.

    He turns into it and we follow Amy as she steps into the
    office behind him to find-


    INT. FATHER'S OFFICE - DAY

    The CLOSET DOOR rattling at the far side of the room. The
    Little Girl (who we now realize is a YOUNG AMY) is screaming
    on the other side. We now know this door. Her Father marches
    toward it, his rage building.


    INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

    Back to scene.

    Amy screams out to him.

                           AMY                                       
                 Leave her alone!                                    

    INT. FATHER'S OFFICE - DAY(FLASHBACK)

    His hand tightens around the knob.

    He opens the door, raising his free hand, ready to strike a
    powerful blow.

    YOUNG AMY stands there quietly, with the sweetest smile on
    her face.

    Then HE SEES THE KNIFE. The BUTCHER KNIFE in YOUNG AMY'S         
    HAND.                                                            

  

                                77



    But it's over in a blink as she quickly buries it deep in his
    chest.

    He stumbles back from the closet in slow-motion as-

    INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDORS

    Amy screams. She reacts to the violence.

    Her vision is blurring and fading fast as her life rushes out
    of her.

    She turns back to her Father and everything is in slow-motion
    as we-

    INTERCUT:

    Her Father stumbling back.

    Amy losing consciousness.

    Her Father falling backwards. The knife buried up to the
    handle in his chest.

    Amy hitting her knees and wobbling there for a beat, trying
    to hold on.

    Her Father's head falling backward.

    Amy's head falling backward onto the floor.

    Young Amy stands there and stares without emotion

    WE HOLD TIGHT ON AMY'S FACE FROM ABOVE as her eyes flutter
    closed.

    And then- Young Amy all alone in the world. Stands there over
    the body. We see for the first time a smile from the young
    girl.


    INT. WINTER'S ROOM - DAY

    AMY'S EYES SNAP OPEN as we quickly BOOM UP to find her lying
    on a mattress in the middle of the floor surrounded by-

    THE DEADERS. She's in the middle of the ritual. The Deaders
    are all chanting. Marla and Joey are there.

                          DEADERS (O.C.)
                My skin isn't real. My eyes aren't real.
                My muscles aren't real.
                          (MORE)

                                78

                         DEADERS(cont'd)
              My bones, my heart, my veins and nerves,
              and flesh and meat... aren't real. What I
              see, what I hear, what I taste, what I
              touch, what I remember, what I think,
              what I feel, aren't real.

    With a glance she can see that the PUZZLE BOX, in its solved
    configuration, sits on a make-shift altar at the head of the
    mattress.

    WINTER is towering over her at her feet. He holds out a knife
    -- THE FAMILIAR STILETTO -- for her to take.

                        WINTER
              You've gone through this before Amy. Go
              through it again -- with me.

    Amy has a sudden look of resignation, mixed with a little
    relief. She reaches out and slowly takes the knife from
    Winter.

                        WINTER
              That's it. I knew you were the one. The
              second I saw you, I knew you were the
              one.

    The chanting continues.

                        DEADERS
              My skin isn't real. My eyes aren't real.
              My muscles aren't real. My bones, my
              heart, my veins and nerves, and flesh and
              meat... aren't real. What I see, what I
              hear, what I taste, what I touch, what I
              remember, what I think, what I feel,
              isn't real.

    Amy looks at Marla. She looks deader then ever. She chants
    with the others. Winter holds the knife closer for Amy.

    Amy looks at the PUZZLE BOX. RAYS OF LIGHT start to stretch
    out like hands and swirl from the PUZZLE BOX.

    THE ROOM STARTS TO RUMBLE.

    A BLACK VOID starts to take shape and swirl behind them.
    Winter is pleased.

                        WINTER
              It's working. I knew it.

    He kneels down next to Amy.

                               79



                        WINTER
              Say it with us Amy. You have to say it
              with us.

    Amy's hands start to tremble.

                         AMY
              I can't.

                        WINTER
              Yes you can Amy. You're one of us now,
              all you have to do is take this final
              step and let the pain go. And welcome a
              world of ultimate pleasures.
              AN ARM, bluish white, stretches out from
              the VOID trying to grab Joey who ducks
              it's grasp.

    The Deaders break the circle around Amy as more ARMS reach
    out from the void. The VOICES OF TORTURED SOULS, twisted and
    warped, scream out for help in the wind that BURSTS out of
    the void.

    HOOKS AND CHAINS reach out and grab the outstretched arms,
    dragging them back into the VOID. Back into Hell.

    The Deaders turn to Winter -- they're all a little freaked
    out. From the look on their faces it's clear that this isn't
    at all what they expected.

                         JOEY
              Where are the naked chicks? The oil? The
              orgies?

    It's not what Winter expected either.

                         WINTER
                  (calm)
              Finish it Amy.

                         AMY
              I can't.

                         WINTER
                  (screams)
              Finish it!

    Amy steels herself with sudden resolve.

                        AMY
              I don't think so.

  

                              80



    And with that Amy SLAMS THE KNIFE Into the makeshift alter
    next to her.

    And that's when-

    PINHEAD steps through the void and into this world. A few
    CENOBITES follow.

    All the Deaders step back - this is weird... even for them.

    Amy leaps up and stumbles back as Pinhead slowly approaches
    Winter, carefully studying him as he does, until he's right
    in Winter's face.

                        PINHEAD
              I see that evil does run in the family.

     inter is plays it tough. But it's all an act.

                        PINHEAD
              Your lineage is of a craftsman. You
              should have stayed in the family
              business. I sacrificed my mortal self for
              that box.

                        WINTER
              It's mine now. It belongs to me.

                        PINHEAD
              That's where you're painfully wrong. We
              belong to it.

                        WINTER
              It created you, and it can destroy you.
                  (to Amy)
              Amy, finish it!

                        PINHEAD
              When it is done with me -- perhaps -- but
              I'm afraid one's own personal hell is
              eternal, as you will soon see.

    Pinhead takes in the Puzzle Box on the makeshift altar, the
    Deaders, Amy.

                        PINHEAD
              The box is not just the map of the road --
              it is the road itself.

                        WINTER
              The ultimate experience.

                                81



                        PINHEAD
              Experience is a funny thing boy, it likes
              to test us first and teach us later. Are
              you sure you can pass the test? Are you
              sure you want to?

                        WINTER
              You can't hurt me.

    Pinhead smiles.

                        PINHEAD
              It's not the first time I've heard that.

    AND THEN IT'S HOOKS AND CHAINS TIME.

    They reach out from the void all around Winter and stab into
    him. He screams out in complete agony as they tear at him and
    stretch his limbs to the point of ripping them off.

    AND THEN THEY STOP.

                        PINHEAD
              And it won't be the last.

    Winter's screams subside as a rush of pain surges through
    him, numbing him.

    He's just able to turn his head to Pinhead and crack the
    slightest "fuck you" smile.

    Winter tries to talk, but the skin around his mouth is
    stretched too tight.

                         PINHEAD
              When you attempted to challenge evil you
              entered into my domain. There is no way
              in but through me.

    Pinhead gets in close to Winter's face.

                        PINHEAD
              Careful what you wish for.

    Now we can see the terror in Winter's eyes.

                        PINHEAD
              It just might come true.

    Winter screams as he is finally torn apart by the chains.        
    Pinhead turns his attention to the DEADERS.                      

  


                                82



                        PINHEAD                                      
              This world, it obviously disappoints you                                                                     
              all. Perhaps that's why you choose to
              begin this journey. And as long as you so              
              willingly accepted, allow me to finish                                                                     
              off what he started.


    And out of the darkness an oversized MENACING CHAIN comes
    FLYING OUT, HARPOONING straight through the midsections of       
    all the deaders lined on the right side of Amy. Piercing         
                                                                     
    them at all different levels.

    Then another chain HARPOONS the Deaders on the left side. The
    Deaders look like fish on a stringer. They dangle there,
    suspended by the chains.

                         PINHEAD
                  (to Amy)
              And as for you. You opened the box, you                
              brought us all together. You chose                     
              wisely. I'm pleased.

                        AMY                                          
              I didn't want any of this. They used me                
              to open the box. I didn't choose to do                 
              anything.                                              
    Amy looks to Marla, she's got the fear of god in her. Pinhead
    sees Amy looking for help.

                        PINHEAD
              She's one of us now Amy. Now a guide to
              the far reaches of pleasure. To a world
              where suffering is taken to higher level.

                         AMY
              Please.

                        PINHEAD
              You opened the box.

                        AMY
              I didn't mean to. I only wanted the
              truth.

                        PINHEAD
              And now you have it. But knowledge comes
              with a price -- and it's time to pay.

                        AMY
              What about them?

           


                                83



    We see the CENOBITES now with snake-like tongues working
    their way up the line of Deaders towards Amy. They're
    preparing each one as they pass. Poking them with large pins,
    piercing them, stitching them, filleting them, etc...

                        PINHEAD
              They belong to me now. They offered
              themselves willingly through him to me --
              And now it's time for you to do the same.

    Amy grabs the knife from the floor and points it at Pinhead.

                        PINHEAD
              It won't be that easy this time. But yes,              
              your Father is with us too. And he's
              waiting for you.

    These words pierce through Amy. She looks at Marla, now
    barely hanging on to any signs of liveliness. Her head lifts
    up to Amy.

                         ARLA
              You're here to stop this Amy. He needs
              your soul willingly. Don't let him take
              you. Don't go willingly.

    Marla looks at the knife. Amy gets it, she only has one way
    out. Marla can see the uncertainty in her eyes.

                        MARLA
              Its over. Winter is gone. You can't come               
              back. You won't become a Deader...or one               
              of them.                                               

    Marla looks to Pinhead, then back to Amy. They both know what    
    she has to do.     
                                              
                        MARLA                                        
                  (her final words)
              Only he can bring you back.

    Amy sees the meat hanging off the chains. It used to be          
    Winter. She glares at Pinhead with a sudden look of              
    confidence, like a light bulb has gone off and she can
    finally see her way out. She raises the knife high in front
    of her.

    The two SNAKE-TONGUED CENOBITES move in closer to Amy. They
    can't wait to have a little taste.

    For a moment, Pinhead is pleased, then Amy begins the DEADER
    CHANT, but reverses its meaning.

                                   84


                 AMY                               PINHEAD
    My skin IS real. My eyes ARE       It's too late to save
    real. My muscles are real. My      yourself. Your soul is mine
    bones, my heart, my veins and      and mine alone. Your Father
    nerves, and flesh and meat...      is waiting for you. He misses
    are real. What I see, what I       you so much.
    hear, what I taste, what I            (louder)
    touch, what I remember, what       The only way out Amy Klein --
    I think, what I feel, is           is THROUGH ME.
    real.


    The Cenobites freeze for a beat and turn to Pinhead. They
    haven't seen that before.

    She stares Pinhead right in the eyes.

                        AMY
              I didn't give my soul to him...

    Amy points the knife at what's left of Winter.

                        AMY
              ...and I'm not giving it to you.

    And with that Amy thrusts the knife into her chest. Pinhead
    screams out.

                         PINHEAD
              No!

    The room starts to fill with a BRIGHT LIGHT. The Puzzle Box
    starts to close as-

    Pinhead and the boys are sucked back into the void, which
    closes behind them.

    Amy looks up from the knife planted deep in her gut-

    - AND SMILES. She tips out of frame as the screen bleaches
    white and we-

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:


    INT. CHARLES RICKMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

    Where we suddenly find ourselves lost in some bright
    flickering space, filled with the sound of static. Abruptly,
    the static vanishes, the flickering space congeals -- and we
    realize that we are watching a television screen.

    And as we PULL BACK, we realize that we are seeing a news           
    report on from SNN (Satellite News Network).                        

                                                                    



                               85



    We are in Charles's office. He's there watching this new        
    report.                                                         
    Images of what appear to be a terrible explosion fill the
    frame (stock footage from a terrorist attack in London                                                                     
    perhaps?) Cars on fire, imploded building, panic in the
    street, etc...                                                  
    The door opens and his assistant BETTY comes in. She watches
    Charles for a moment.)

                        BETTY
              I just talked to the Police. Still,
              nothing. She's just gone. Left her hotel,             
              left her clothes, left her money. No sign
              of her anywhere.

                        CHARLES
              See no Amy. Hear no Amy...

                        BETTY
              Just like Marla Chen. Apartment just left
              empty. No trace. The police say its to                
              early to file an official report.                     
                  (off his concerned look)
              Do you think they she with foul play?  
               
                         CHARLES                                    
              (off the TV) I don't know, I just don't               
              know.                                                 
                  (beat)
              Too bad, too. It would have made a hell               
              of a story. (beat)                                    
              I'm sure she'll come walking in here any              
              minute, carrying with her my story.                   

    Charles watches the report on the TV. Pandemonium in the
    streets. 
                                                       
              It's a hell of a story, too. It just gets             
              better and better. And it looks like I                
              just may need somebody else crazy enough              
              to go get it.             
                            
                        BETTY
              Maybe you have. Your three o'clock's
              here.

    Betty leans her head out of the room signalling someone out
    in the hall to come in.

 

                                 86



    A YOUNG BOMBSHELL REPORTER enters, holds out her hand to
    Charles who suddenly perks up as he takes it and leads her to
    the couch.

    As he does we move past Charles and the young reporter to the

    Miss Turner. It's a pleasure    Witnesses say the building,
    to meet you welcome you to      located at the corner of
    our team. Let's cut right to    Poteilari and Minvara just
    it, shall we.                   imploded. Firefighters have
    I received this tape which I    been on the scene for several

    We move past the image of the puzzlebox on the TV and settle

    We get a sense that maybe she's finally at peace.

INT. CAR DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

KIRSTY GOODING looks out the passenger window as the trees go
whizzing past. She's attractive, late twenties, warmly
sophisticated. Something makes her smile. She turns to the
driver and thinks real hard as she says this.

                    KIRSTY
          Okay. Cubic root of nine thousand two
          hundred and sixty one.

TREVOR is her husband, late twenties as well. God gave him
brains and beauty. He has used them both prodigiously.

                    TREVOR
          Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now
          Kirsty?

                    KIRSTY
          Shut up and play darling. Your turn.

                    TREVOR
          Five hundred ninety two thousand seven
          hundred and four.

                    KIRSTY
          Uh... eighty two?

                    TREVOR
          Eighty four.

Kirsty takes a calculator out of her purse and double checks
the math.

                    KIRSTY
          You win! Okay pull over.

                    TREVOR
              (looking at his watch)
          But... I thought...

                    KIRSTY
              (laughing)
          If what I've heard is true this could be
          the last time for a long long time.
          Besides we've got a whole seven minutes
          before the next one. Clock's ticking.
          Tick-tock...

Trevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding.

                    KIRSTY
              (through clenched teeth)
          PULL OVER NOW.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                 2.
CONTINUED:


Then pulls over to the side of the road. Kirsty reaches over,
quickly unzips his pants immediately goes down on Trevor OUT
OF FRAME. He reacts accordingly. A little pleasure, utter
shock.

                       KIRSTY'S VOICE
                 (from BELOW FRAME)
             Honey what's wrong?

Kirsty rises INTO FRAME once again.

                       TREVOR
             What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this
             anyway?

                       KIRSTY
                 (self-conscious)
             I'm... I'm doing a very special thing
             here. And you can't even ... respond?

                       TREVOR
             Sorry honey the present situation isn't
             exactly fodder for an erection. Shouldn't
             we be getting to the hospital?

FULL ON Kirsty. For the first time WE SEE her big pregnant
belly sticking out. She looks at Trevor innocently.

                       KIRSTY
             I was going to keep breathing you know.
             You think I'm an amateur or something?

Trevor stuffs himself back in his pants, puts the car in gear
and presses the accelerator.

                       TREVOR
             Just concentrate on the task at hand
             please. Listen to me. You should be
             giving ME this lecture.

                       KIRSTY
             You've been cheating on me haven't you?

                       TREVOR
             Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor
             during your last contraction.

                       KIRSTY
             Roughly two thirds of married men who
             cheat start during the eighth month of
             their wives' first pregnancy.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                              3.
CONTINUED: (2)


                    TREVOR
          I would never cheat on you. Not while
          you're pregnant now you know that.

                    KIRSTY
              (features tightening)
          Okay... uh oh here comes another one.

                    TREVOR
          Share the pain Kirsty.

She takes Trevor's hand and squeezes as hard as she can. IN
CLOSE UP WE SEE:

A SOLVED RUBIC'S CUBE sitting between them.

Do we need this vision of the solved rubics cube?

EXT. ROAD - DAY

The car is approaching a bridge.

INT. CAR - DAY

Trevor takes his hand off the wheel to look at his watch.

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
          One fifteen.

                    KIRSTY
              (in dire pain)
          Oh God...... Trevor, I think my water
          just broke.

Trevor grabs the wheel again. Kirsty GASPS.

                    KIRSTY (CONT'D)
          Oh my God. It's coming out.

                    TREVOR
          What?

                    KIRSTY
          THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT!
          SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!

Trevor looks at her, trying to stay calm.

                    TREVOR
          Okay Kirsty don't panic. Just keep
          breathing! DON'T PANIC! Put the seat back
          and hold on to something. Were almost
          there!

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                 4.
CONTINUED:


Kristy's hand moves down the along side the seat between the
door and she plunges back with the seat. She looks at Trevor
wide eyed.

Shes about to give birth in a Chevrolet.

                       KIRSTY
             OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!! (breathing
             heavily) oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor,
             It's coming out.

                       TREVOR
             This isn't happening.



Kristy starts to convulse with pain. She begins to tremble
and her arms flail about in an attempt to ease her
discomfort. She grabs Trevors arm for support.

                       TREVOR
             Honey, take it easy.    Your gonna be
             alright.

Kristy becomes more violent, kicking her legs up onto the
dashboard. She starts grabbing Trevors arm a little more
violently, causing Trevors to weave a bit on the road as he
recoils.

EXT. CAR DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

The car lunges to the side of the road and weaves a bit in
the gravel. Up ahead a bridge approaches.

INT. CAR - DAY

Trevor regains control of the car.

                       TREVOR (cont'd)
             Kristy! Take it easy. everythings gonna
             be alright. Com'on, start the breathing,
             with me... come on. One, two-three, and
             blow..

Trevor starts the lamanns method alone, as Kristy appears to
have passed out from the pain. She has her head leaned away
from him and is limp in the passengers seat.

                        TREVOR (cont'd)
             Krist.   Honey. Kristy!

Kristy doesn't answer. Trevors puts his arm on her and
shakes her. She doesn't react.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                            5.
CONTINUED:


                       TREVOR (cont'd)
             Kristy! Honey wake up!

Trevors attention is now on his unconscious wife rather than
the two lane road which stretches across the bridge.

                       TREVOR (cont'd)
             Honey, wake up. Please wake up.

And with that Kristy's does exactly that. She lunges toward
him in a violent spasm and scares the shit out of him (and
us) which causes Trevor to now completely lose control of the
car.

INT./EXT. CAR - DAY

The rest is a blur...

... Trevor loses control of the steering wheel... Kirsty
SCREAMS... Their car skids from one side of the bridge to the
other-careening toward the guardrail- SMASH!

The car is plummeting toward the river below. Trevor and
Kirsty brace themselves. The car hits the surface...

INT. RIVER, UNDERWATER - DAY

Trevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles. He
breaks the surface and gasps for air. Getting his bearings
he see the car bobbing on the surface, the current is
separating him from his wife.

Treading water, he looks out at the car and there she is
trapped inside...

Kirsty

Still belted to her seat. Her eyes are wide with desperation,
breath quickening, sinking fast... Kristy pounds the window
with her hands, trying to get out. She's trapped.

Apparently giving in, she presses a hand against the
windshield just before the car disappears under the
surface...

EXT. SHORE - DAY

Trevor paddles hard to the shore. Exhausted, he crawls onto
the shore underneath the bridge they just jumped.

Trevor stands trying to process what just happened in the
last fifteen seconds. He screams out for his wife, and to
what has just happened.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              6.
CONTINUED:


                       TREVOR
             Kristy!
             Kristy!

Trevor drops to his knee's in distress.

                       TREVOR (cont'd)
             Oh my God, Kristy! Please Kristy.
             (frantically) I'm so sorry, Kristy.




He hears something from above and looks up. A chunk of the
bashed-up guardrail from the bridge has just snapped off and
is sailing right down toward him-

TREVOR BLACKS OUT JUST AS THE THING HITS HIM

WHITE LIGHT FLOODS HIS VISION...

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Trevor's eyes blink open, darting left and right. He is on a
bed, his head bandaged.

AN ANGULAR NURSE ENTERS the room, walking up to Trevor's bed.

                       TREVOR
             Where is she...? Where's Kirsty?

The Nurse grabs Trevor's right arm and straps it to the side
of the bed. She isn't exactly one of God's gentler creatures.

                       TREVOR
             Hey, what are you-

She moves to Trevor's legs, strapping them down as well, then
his other arm.

By now SEVERAL SURGEONS ENTER the room, features obscured by
surgical masks.

The Nurse fastens a clamp around Trevor's head, attaches it
to the bed.

Trevor is completely discombobulated. The surgeons gather
behind Trevor's bed.

CLOSE ON TREVOR'S FACE as he struggles to see what's
happening back there but it's useless.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              7.
CONTINUED:

He cannot move a muscle. He hears a sickening SAWING noise
and his eyes bulge in horror.

WIDE as the doctors calmly lift Trevor's freshly sawed
cranium from his head exposing his brain. The CHIEF SURGEON-
a large unshaven man with magnifying lens alreaday in place
make his eyes enormous and his face grotesquely distorted. He
walks up, presented with a tray full of evenly arranged pins.
He cranks up the magnification of his lenes which make his
eyes appear even larger. Though no one speaks his name his
name tag reads Dr. Barker.

                       TREVOR
             What are you people doing?!

The Chief Surgeon takes one of the pins and gently pushes
into a Trevor's frontal lobe.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
             What's happening to-!

Trevor's eyes glaze over and his jaw relaxes. The chief
surgeon speaks in an english accent.

                       CHIEF SURGEON
             As you can see I just accessed the speech
             center, temporarily shutting down all
             verbal ability.

As the Chief Surgeon continues he takes several more pins off
the tray.

                       CHIEF SURGEON (CONT'D)
             The goal is find the exact point in the
             brain where moral decisions are made, the
             place where right and wrong is
             distinguished. In exploring this Morality
             Center I will most likely be triggering
             memories, disrupting the unconscious. Our
             patient may experience some distress
             during the proceedings but they are not
             due to pain. It is merely our patient-
             recalling his past...

Chief Surgeon slips another pin into Trevors exposed brain.

                       CHIEF SURGEON (cont'd)
             As he was thrown into the lake, where the
             beast and the false prophet had been
             thrown.

The Chief Surgeon voice lowers and his eyes turn black. The
eye magification no at a hideous level, showing jet black
eyes.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                    CHIEF SURGEON (cont'd)
          Where you will be tormented day and night
          for ever and ever. (rev.20:10)



Trevor looks at the frowning nurse who is watching over him.
Chief Surgeon sticks a needle into another spot on Trevor's
brain.

TREVOR'S POV: The nurse is suddenly a pale gargoyle with
blackened eyes.

Trevor opens his mouth to scream and-

-IN A BURST OF WHITE LIGHT, AN ANGELIC WOMAN is now standing
before him. She is bathed in a haze of white light.

                    ANGELIC WOMAN
          Well? What do say Trevor? Que pasa?

Trevor relaxes. His bindings are gone. The gargoyle nurse is
gone. The surgeons are gone. And his brain is sitting safely
within his inviolated skull, upon which now sit a few
electrodes. The bandage is no longer there.

But from his pain wracked expression we know the pain in his
head is still very real. He reaches for his head, makes sure
its all intact.

                    TREVOR
          Where do I start?

                     ANGELIC WOMAN
          How's the old noggin? Any change in the
          intensity?

She touches him gently.

                    ANGELIC WOMAN (cont'd)
          Can you describe the pains?

Trevor looks up. The angelic woman smiles back at him. She's
in scrubs, a stethoscope dangling from her neck. Trevor
winces.

                    TREVOR
          I'm not sure. How about a jackhammer in
          the Occipital lobe?

She picks up a pad and scribbles something on it. Trevor
notices she's wearing a nameplate. Dr. ALLISON DORMERE.

                    TREVOR
          Are you a dream too?

                    ALLISON
          Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...

                    TREVOR
          What just happened to me anyway? It
          looked like a dream but it felt like
          reality.

                    ALLISON
          It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so
          much of it, you could be asleep and
          dreaming even with your eyes wide open.

Terevors quickly recalls the accident. Fearing the worst.

                    TREVOR
          Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?

                    ALLISON
              (confused)
          Your wife...?

AN OLDER DOCTOR walks in. AMBROSE. He gives Trevor an icy
look, then looks at Trevor's chart.

                    ALLISON
              (to Ambrose)
          Still a little hazy. He's still in pain
          too, even after the morphine. I recommend
          we admit him. At least for another day...
              (leaning in, sotto)
          He just asked for his wife...

                    AMBROSE
          Well I can't find any abnormalities. I
          think we're ready for discharge.

                    ALLISON
          But, Dr. Ambrose-

                    AMBROSE
              (looking up at Trevor)
          I think it's time to ween you off these
          painkillers too. Wouldn't want you to
          develop a dependency to them. You might
          do things like come to the hospital for
          no reason other than to get a fix,
          wouldn't you?

Ambrose gives Trevor a fatherly smile then EXITS, not even
looking at Allison. Allison watches him go, then turns back
to Trevor... then smiles perkily.

                    ALLISON
          Well looks like you're going home! Hope
          you brought your bus pass.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Trevor starts nodding out. The bus is practically empty. TWO
BLACK CHILDREN a boy and a girl sit across from Trevor. A
CREEPY OLD WOMAN sits further back, knitting something.

A CHURCH BELL RINGING causes Trevor to wake again up, wincing
at the sound. As the church passes the BELL becomes louder
and louder.

Trevor hears LAUGHTER and looks up at the children. The girl
and her brother seem to be play-fighting over a toy they hold
between them. Trevor looks at the toy getting stretched this
way and that.

                    TREVOR
          Do you kids mind keeping it down?

The creepy old woman speaks up.

                    OLD WOMAN
          Aww let them be. They're only kids.

Trevor notices what the Old Woman is knitting is a baby's
bootie. As the children continue to laugh at him Trevor
stares at the bootie tears welling up.

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT

Trevor lives in a dingy place, one step up from poverty-
level. Funny thing is this used to be a nicer place. We see
remnants of a feminine touch long since past. Dirty dishes
sit in the sink. A cockroach skitters across the kitchenette.

Trevor sits at his TV playing an extremely violent videogame.
We're talking heads getting blown off, bodies exploding,
limbs being severed. As the end ends a DEMONIC VOICE chuckles
from the TV.

                    DEMONIC VOICE FROM TV
          YOU LOSE...

The screen flashes TRY AGAIN? Trevor takes a swig of beer and
sits back in the easy chair looking at something atop the TV.
A picture of Kirsty.

                                                             11.



INT. TREVOR'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Trevor looks through an old photo album. Pictures of him and
Kirsty. Some pictures of him. A lot of pictures of Kirsty.
Smiles, smiles, smiles...

He stops at one close up of them mugging at a camera they've
pointed on themselves. All we see is their faces, the rest is
dark and blurry, except for one thing. A small shadowy object
Kirsty is holding.

EXT. CUBIC ROUTE ACTUARIAL RESEARCH - DAY

Dressed in a button down shirt and tie, Trevor walks up to
the pale utilitarian box-like structure.

INT. CUBIC ROUTE, BULLPEN - DAY

It is a maze of cubicles iced by harsh fluorescence. It is a
mill of data research, where the TAPPING of fingers on
computer keypads never ends...

INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY

... no thanks to Trevor, who has already resumed his head-in-
hands position at his desk. He rubs his eyes, seemingly
blinded by the screen staring back at him.

A MAN Trevor's age rolls up on his office chair beside
Trevor, banging into the desk. BRET. Trevor's co-worker and
cubicle mate.

                    BRET
          Trevor what is the metric probability of
          you getting any work done at all today?

                    TREVOR
          Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a
          split coconut.

                    BRET
          Dude there is a track on the carpet
          between here and the bathroom. It was
          made by your ass. You've been dragging it
          all fucking week.
          What happened to you yesterday?


Bret eyes Trevor suspiciously. Then smiling...

                    BRET (cont'd)
          You never came back after lunch. Did you
          get a piece o'ass, you bastard?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:




                       TREVOR
             Give me a break. I checked back into the
             hospital- amongst other things.

                       BRET
             Hospital? You haven't been to the
             hospital since uh...

                       TREVOR
             Since what?

                       BRET
                 (getting uncomfortable)
             Look never mind. Just get some numbers
             going- any numbers at all will due. The
             hills have eyes remember?

Bret casually gestures to a surveillance camera overhead that
sweeps across the room like a prison spotlight.

                       BRET (CONT'D)
             I'm just looking out for ya.

Bret slides back over to his work station.

Trevor puts his hands on the computer keys and starts to
type. A jolt of pain rips through his cranium forcing him to
stop. Bret stops typing and breathes an exasperated SIGH.

                       BRET
             Sixty five point three percent of all
             headaches are due to low sugar levels in
             the bloodstream Trevor.

A light bulb seems to go off over Trevor's head.

INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY

Inside the narrow room blasted in fluorescent light, Trevor
eyes a vending machine, examining its wares. He peruses the
sundry sugary snacks, looking for just the right fix.

It's so quiet in here we can almost hear his head pounding in
pain. He shuts his eyes. A couple of the fluorescent bulbs
over his head wink out and the rest flicker weakly.

When Trevor opens his eyes again he notices the room has
gotten considerably darker. He looks up at the weakening
lights and grunts in disgust.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


The light is just dim enough now so that he can't see what's
in the vending machine. He goes right up to the glass and
peers into the machine, using his hand as a visor. This
strain on his eyes intensifies his headache.

It's still pretty murky inside the glass case. Trevor squints
and just when he thinks he can read a wrapper on... what is
it? A candy bar?-

A PALE HAND suddenly presses against the glass from inside
the machine. Trevor jolts backwards. The hand is gone. But in
the reflection of the glass Trevor notices someone has been
standing behind him. He whirls around-

-and is face to face with our worst nightmare: PINHEAD.

                       PINHEAD
             It's too late.

Pinhead lashes out at Trevor striking his face with a clawed
hand the rips his face clean off. The lights are back up as
Trevor slams against the machine and grabs his face. It's
still there!

Where Pinhead was standing is THE WOMAN who just slapped him.

                       WOMAN
             SNAP OUT OF IT!

She is attractive and studious. Her sensible business attire
can't hide a very curvaceous body. This is Trevor's
supervisor GWEN.

                       GWEN
             Jesus what the hell was that? It's like
             you saw a ghost or something.

Trevor slowly peers into the vending machine. Nope. Nobody
here but your average every-day candy bars. Trevor is
dumbfounded.

                       GWEN (CONT'D)
                 (angrily)
             Come on speak up, Gooding, I'm trying to
             run a business here. I can't have people
             flipping out in the break room when they
             should be slaving away at their desks.

                       TREVOR
             Sorry I just kind of... spaced for a
             second there.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                    GWEN
          Well don't let it happen again. Or I may
          have to spank you.

Gwen grins sinfully at Trevor and pushes his shoulders back
against the vending machine. Before he realizes it, she's
kissing him real hard. He gently ducks out from under her,
freeing himself.

                    GWEN (CONT'D)
          Get back here, junior bean counter. This
          is your supervisor speaking.

                    TREVOR
          Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.

                    GWEN
          How do you think you got this job, cock?
              (cozying up to him)
          Mmm. I'm still tingling all over from our
          little midnight swim.

Trevor looks constipated. He has no recollection of this.
Gwen strokes his face.

                    GWEN (CONT'D)
          What's wrong, Trev?

                    TREVOR
          Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-

                    GWEN
          And it shows. Least it did last night at
          the quarry. In a big way.

Trevor gently pushes her off him again.

                    TREVOR
          Please you're going way too fast for me
          here.

                    GWEN
          YOU'RE giving ME a speeding ticket? Mr.
          Mario Andretti himself?

                    TREVOR
          Gwen, my wife's dead.

                    GWEN
          Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize
          it must be hard. But Christ how long does
          it take someone to move on?


                                                     (CONTINUED)

            No, making another woman compete with
            someone who's been dead eight months.
            That's cold.

This goes through Trevor like a shot. EIGHT MONTHS!

Here we go- Dolly in zoom out! In Close up of Trevor we...

FLASHBACK

QUICK FLASHES of Kirsty's hand pounding on the windshield,
the car sinking into the lake, a quick cut of a dark figure
with a bright ring, and shots of two naked bodies slamming
against each other in climax course through Trevor's mind.
Finally, over the images of erotica we hear Gwens voice as
one of the characters.

                    GWEN (cont'd)
        Yeah, Trevor thats it. Thats it.

And back in the real world, Trevor is now locking lips with a
very ready Gwen. His hand is up her skirt. He stops abruptly
and pulls back.

                      TREVOR
            I'm sorry Gwen. I don't know what's
            happening to me. (zipping up) I think
            it's the painkillers, really.

Gwen rolls her eyes. She re-adjusts her self and now getting
a little pissy. She's heard this one before.

                      TREVOR (CONT'D)
            They mess with my head. Yesterday gets
            blacked out and a memory from months ago
            is played out in vivid technicolor. Like
            the accident just happened you know?

Gwen softens up. Trevor is so earnest, so vulnerable.

                      GWEN
            Why don't you let me take you out
            tonight? I promise to make it the most
            memorable night of your life.

She kisses him. He braces himself. She grabs his butt, then
goes for the door.

          some fucking work done.

INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY

Trevor relentlessly crunches numbers at his computer. He
pauses a moment to stretch and rubs his eyes. A PING from his
computer announces he has an INTEROFFICE MEMO- FILE ATTACHED.
Trevor goes to the mailbox on his screen, clicks.

Up comes a jpeg slideshow. Each picture is of Gwen dressed in
a piece of sexy lingerie. The caption underneath reads WORK
HARDER. Looking around his cubicle, he then takes another
look at the jpeg. Trevor stands up in the cubicle and we see
him peer the outer office looking for Gwen. He sits back
down. Embarrassed Trevor closes the memo at least for now.

TREVOR'S PHONE RINGS. Startleing him(and us). He picks it up.

                    TREVOR

          homicide. It's about your wife.

Push in on to a bewildered Trevor.

INT. LANGE'S OFFICE, HOMICIDE - DAY

It is a dank crumbling room. A place where sunlight is not
welcome. DETECTIVE LANGE, a handsome graying gentleman who's
plagued with a chronic case of post nasal drip, sits at his
desk.

Trevor sits across from him. Behind Trevor is another empty
desk.

As Lange speaks he SNIFFS wetly every so often.

             For one thing there were no skid marks on

             internally with the vehicle either. Like
             the car had been driven off the bridge
             intentionally.

                       TREVOR
             It should all in the report. I told you
             guys everything. She was giving birth in
             the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel
             and I lost control.

             I did read that, yes. (flipping through

This time she doesn't wake up.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

from one side of the bridge to the other- careening toward
the guardrail- SMASH!

The car is plummeting toward the river below... The car hits
the surface...

Trevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles. He
swims up to the passenger door and tries the handle. It won't
give. Unable to breathe Trevor finally swims up...

EXT. SHORE - DAY

He breaks the surface and crawls onto the shore...

He looks out at the car to where she should be trapped
inside...

CONTINUED:


Trevors eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening,
The car is sinking fast...

He looks at the car and calls out, but there is no Kristy
insight.

The car disappears under the surface...

Trevor hears something from above and looks up. A chunk of
the bashed-up guardrail is sailing right down toward him-

TREVOR BLACKS OUT JUST AS THE THING HITS HIM

INT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY

                       LANGE
             Mr. Gooding? You still in there?

Trevor blinks and looks around him. Lange is sitting just
where they were when he saw him last. Only now there's a very
wary look on his face. Whoa.

                       TREVOR
             Uhh. Yes detective, sorry. Just trying to
             recollect, you know?

Lange nods.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
             Okay. From what I remember now, maybe my
             wife was thrown from the car when it hit
             the water. Maybe she wasn't trapped
             inside.

Lange checks the report again. He believes Trevor...or does
he?

                       LANGE'S VOICE
             That's a start. I'll tell the people
             trawling the river maybe it makes a
             difference maybe not. Thanks for your
             help Trevor. If we have any more
             questions you'll get a call from myself
             or my partner Detective Givens.

Lange stands up and backs up awkwardly to a file behind his
desk. Trevor stares at him suspiciously.

                       TREVOR
             You guys know something I don't?




                                                        (CONTINUED)

                       LANGE
             All things considered we probably know a
             lot less than you do. Have a good
             afternoon, Mr. Gooding.

Trevor exits, both men maintain eye contact as the door
closes between him.

EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT

The bus pulls up to the curb. Trevor climbs out and starts
walking down the empty street. As soon as the bus pulls away,
the only sound heard is Trevor's footsteps.

POV BEHIND TREVOR: We see Trevor's back from a slight
distance. Someone is following him.

Sensing this, Trevor looks behind him. Nothing but an empty
sidewalk. Trevor hurries his pace, almost there at his
apartment building. He glances behind him again. Nope, nobody
there... then suddenly-

-A DARK FIGURE passes under a streetlight on the opposite
side of the street. Trevor turns a corner no picking up the
pace a little. The DARK FIGURE follows, it picks up it's pace
as well.

Trevors walks an d approaches a small alley way. Should he
take this home?

A enraged Pitbull nearly rips his nose off as it Barks and
lunges to the end of a heavy chain leash. Trevor (and us)
about piss our pant's. The dog continues barking, Trevor
regains his composure. Suddenly the dogs attention moves
toward the direction of the DARK FIGURE. Amazingly, it stops
barking and actually cowers back into the shadows.

Spooked, Trevor rushes up to:

EXT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT

He hurries up to his apartment building and lets himself in.

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT

He looks out on the street.

The figure is walking up the building opposite his. It's
features are shrouded in shadow, but it is definitely staring
at Trevor, who slams the apartment door behind him. He peers
out at the street from inside the front hall.

The figure is gone.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                             21.
CONTINUED:


Trevors looks around the apartment. He opens the fridge, it
lights up the darkened room. He grabs one of the three items
sitting on the wire racks. About to twist off the cap off a
cold beer, when a light out his window urges him to
investigate. He draws the curtain open and GASPS.

POV OUT WINDOW: Staring back at him, from a dimly lit window
in the apartment building across the street, is the SHADOWY
MAN that followed Trevor home.

The man's face is shrouded in shadows but Trevor can see he's
holding something bundled up in a blanket. The light in the
window winks out, rendering it dark again.

Trevor can almost still see the figure somewhere in the
darkness still gazing at him.

Trevor looks a little sick all of a sudden, like he can't
breathe.

THE BELL FROM A DISTANT CATHEDRAL begins to peel. BONG...
BONG... BONG...

Trevor opens his mouth to draw in a breath but instead spits
out a massive amount of water!

BONG... BONG... BONG...

Trevor falls to the ground, arms and legs thrashing, heaving
up mouthfuls of water. Trevor is drowning...

BONG... BONG... BONG...

In the puddles of water, we see bits of debris: leaves,
pebbles, etc. Finally, a hideous eel-like creature's head
pokes out of Trevor's gaping mouth- it escapes and slithers
across the floor, up the window sill and out into the night.

-the ringing bell stops abruptly and he takes in a humongous
lungful of sweet oxygen. He then notices he is completely
dry. Stunned, he looks about him.

Trevor is now laying on the easychair, nursing a beer. His
videogame is flashing PLAY AGAIN? Whoa.

The BING-BONG! of his doorbell startles him.

Trevor gets the door to find a striking young GOTHIC WOMAN on
the other side. Black hair, lipstick, fingernails. She smiles
(too brightly for someone with such somber appointments) then
summarily lifts her shirt to just below her breasts for
Trevor.


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                             22.
CONTINUED: (2)


                    GOTHIC WOMAN
          Here it is, what do you think?

Trevor looks down at her stomach, the lower half of which
contains tattoos which just break the surface of her jeans.
At its center is a navel pierced with a studded black pearl,
which Gothic Woman then plays with. Trevor looks a little
confused.

                    GOTHIC WOMAN (CONT'D)
          I saw it on the counter, looked at the
          name and the rest is history. It's like,
          named after me. Well...?

                    TREVOR
              (getting uncomfortable)
          Oh. Uh... it's beautiful. I'm sorry, I've
          just been having a weird day...

                    TAWNY
          I totally understand. Listen I don't know
          if you're into incense but, I bought
          some, it's called Witching Hour. To
          inhale it is to love it. I mean the
          stuff'll clear your head big time. Come
          on over, I'll burn some for you. If you
          can't sleep tonight...

She jabs a thumb down the hall behind her.

                     TAWNY (CONT'D)
          ... knock on my door, I'm a total
          insomniac.

                    TREVOR
          No, thanks I've got a... a date tonight-

His eyes roaming her, he finally finds a tattoo on her
shoulder reading:

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
          -Tawny.

                    TAWNY
              (eyebrows raised)
          Whew. You bounce right back don't you?

                    TREVOR
          What do you mean?

                    TAWNY
          Didn't your like... whole life get
          totalled last week?

                    TREVOR
          Last week...

                    TAWNY
          The car accident? Any of this ringing a
          bell?

Trevor eyes her nervously then:

                    TREVOR
          It's not that kind of date.

                    TAWNY
          Hey even if it is more power to ya.
              (awkwardly)
          Alrighty then. Have a good time.

Tawny ambles off to her apartment. Trevor closes the door and
leans against it. He slides down the door and covers his face
with his hands. Another headache coming on.

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - SEVEN THIRTY

Trevor paces in his living room. Looks at watch. Then the
door. Still no sign of Gwen.

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY

Trevor rummages through a closet. Reaching up to a shelf
above him, he tugs at a big cardboard box and pulls. The
entire box comes crashing down and out spill about fifty VHS
tapes, all hand-labeled: KIRSTY & TREVOR, then the date.

He puts one in the VCR, hits play...

It's his wedding video. Trevor watches the festivity of the
wedding ON THE SCREEN, he smiles for the first time.

The wedding portion of the tape ends and a not-so-clean edit
takes us into the honeymoon.

CLOSE ON THE TV SCREEN:

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT

Trevor holds the camera on Kristy who is under the covers in
a generic hotel room. She looks into camera as Trevor adjusts
focus and squares up the frame.

                    KIRSTY
          Well Trevor. It's been one year. Three
          hundred sixty five days.

                       TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)
             Eight thousand seven hundred sixty hours.
             Five hundred twenty five thousand...

Kirsty watches Trevor roam the room. She very comfortable on
camera.

                       KIRSTY
             How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for
             a whole year.

                       TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)
             In a word? Lucrative.

                       KIRSTY
             The best business decision if you ever
             made I'll bet.

                       TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)
             Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt
             work for one second.

                       KIRSTY
             You know what the family lawyer told me
             one our wedding day?

                       TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)
             What?

                       KIRSTY
             Never to put you in my will.

                       TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)
             Really? Why?

                       KIRSTY
             Because you'd be staying with me for me
             and not because you'd get rich if I died
             for some reason.

                       TREVOR
             But you had more wisdom than to listen to
             a false prophet

                       KIRSTY
             There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan
             (prvb 21:30)

They share a moment.    Kristy stares at him quietly through
the camera.

                       KIRSTY (CONT'D)
             And besides, I thought, to hell with
             it... it's okay if you only married me
             for my money.

                       TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)
             Really, why's that?

                       KIRSTY
             I only married you for your body.

They laugh. The camera now looks away from Kristy and into
Trevors suitcase. Trevors pulls out a wrapped present. A
small tightly wrappped, perfectly square gift.

                       KIRSTY (CONT'D)
             What are you doing?

The camera now back on Kristy. And the present comes up into
frame.

                       TREVOR (OFF CAMERA)
             Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.

                       KIRSTY
             For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here,
             you.

The camera begins to wobble as Trevor climbs onto the bed.
Its lands sideways, and we see sheets and covers rustling,
accompanied by the sound of giggling and kissing.

The tape ends. SNOW.

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT

FROM THE COUCH Trevor watches this...Any of this ringing a
bell?

BING BONG!

Trevor gets up and pops the tape out.

BING BONG!

He slowly walks toward the door. He opens it to find a pitch
dark hallway.

                       TREVOR
             Hello? Who's out there?

GWEN suddenly comes out of the darkness clamping her mouth
onto his and examining his tonsils with her tongue.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                       GWEN
             Sorry I'm late dear.

Trevor looks like he'd be more turned on sitting bare-assed
on an autopsy table.

                       TREVOR
             Gwen you scared the living shit out of
             me.

She pushes him toward the chair and sits him in it.

                       GWEN
             You are turning into an old fuddy duddy.
             Shoe.

Gwen puts one foot on his chest.

                       GWEN (CONT'D)
             Come on don't make me beat you.

Trevor pulls the shoe off.

                       GWEN (CONT'D)
             Other shoe.

Trevor does the same for the other leg.

                       GWEN (CONT'D)
             Good boy.
                 (looking around)
             Where's is it?

                       TREVOR
             What?

                       GWEN
             Our little toy. You usually have it up
             and running by now.

                       TREVOR
             Do I really want to know what you're
             talking about?

                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

A VIDEOCAMERA ON A TRIPOD TAPING GWEN KISSING TREVOR ON THE
EASY CHAIR.

The cable from the camera runs all the way to the TV where WE
SEE what's happening as well.

It's intense. Gwen is on top. Gwen aggressively pulls
Trevor's shirt off then goes for his belt. Trevor suddenly
grabs her hands.

                       GWEN
             You're kidding me.

                       TREVOR
             I'm sorry Gwen. I just can't.

Gwen climbs off the chair and throws her jacket back on.

                       GWEN
             You have definitely got a screw loose,
             Trevor. Goodbye.

Stuffing her feet in her shoes, Gwen's out the door.

Trevor SIGHS, relieved the attack is finally over.

About to turn the TV off and stow away his camera. He looks
at the TV and freezes.

THE IMAGE ON THE TV shows that Gwen is still there,
undressing Trevor. Only video Trevor is giving in, kissing
her back, pulling her clothes off.

Trevor looks at the camera. The red "record" light is
flashing. Trevor turns back to the TV walking closer and
closer to the screen.

                       TREVOR
             What the hell?

He waves a hand in front of the camera and his hand actually
appears on the TV in front of the sex image.

TREVOR WATCHES

Trevor and Gwen make love in video. Video Trevor turns to the
the camera (to Trevor) and gives a menacing smile.

Video Trevor looks back up at Gwen, who smiles down at him
carnivorously. She licks her lips.

                       VIDEO GWEN
             There's one thing I should have told you
             right from the beginning Trevor.

Video Trevor doesn't see a knife she manages to slip out of
her purse.

                    VIDEO GWEN (CONT'D)
          I like it pretty rough.

To Trevor's shock Gwen suddenly drags the knife right across
his throat. Blood shoots up at Gwen's grinning face. Blood
pours out of Trevor's mouth and down his chest.

FROM THE COLOR SCREEN Trevor, having just seen himself get
murdered, shouts:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

                    TREVOR
          No!

Allison stands above him Bic razor in her gloved hand. The
bottom half of Trevor's face is covered with shaving cream.

                    ALLISON
          Sorry I thought you were going to stay
          under longer.

His face is clean shaven, a little shaving cream remains
around his chin. He now has several electrodes attached to
his cranium. They're connected to an EEG which BEEPS LOUDLY.
The noise bothers Trevor. His eyes dart this way and that. He
focuses on the Bic razor.

                    TREVOR
           What's happening to me? What are you
          doing?

                    ALLISON
          You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep
          and well, I took the liberty of...I'm
          sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.

Trevor seems to like the attention.


                    TREVOR
          I just had the most vivid dream. I was
          sure I was dying.

                    ALLISON
          Well you can relax now you are quite
          alive. And as long as you're awake, chin
          up.

Trevor puts his chin up and Allison continues shaving his
neck. Trevor studies her face.

                    ALLISON
    (interupting) That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit
    you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like
    Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one
    good thing about coming so near to the end of ones
    life. Everything is new and exciting, like your
    seeing it for the first time.
   You might see things a litlle differently from now
    on.

                     TREVOR
    Your insight is enlightening.


                       ALLISON
             No wisdom, no insight, no plan.

Allison gives him a wink, disarming Trevor.

                       TREVOR
             My wife said that exact same sentence to
             me the day we got married. She even
             winked too.

Allison smiles and puts her hand on his.

                       ALLISON
             Do you use this wife thing to hit on all
             the interns?

                       TREVOR
                 (smiling)
             No... just you.

Allison wipes his face clean with a towel.

                       ALLISON
             There. Just like a baby's butt.

Allison gets up, grabs a clipboard starts filling out a
report. Trevor stares at her.

                    TREVOR
          Allison? Why can't remember what happened
          to my wife? Is it something I'm on
          that's... that's making me forget?

                    ALLISON
          Easy there Trevor. You need to relax.

                    TREVOR
          No I need to remember. Look whatever it
          is take me off it. I can handle pain. I
          can't handle not knowing...

                    ALLISON
          You need to get better first Trevor. Way
          better.
              (scribbling in the chart)
          It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to
          still love someone after they're gone.
          But you've got to quit blaming yourself
          okay...? Okay?

Allison looks up and notices Trevor's body has slackened, his
eyes empty. She drops the clipboard and starts snapping her
fingers over his eyes.

                       ALLISON
          Trevor?

He is unconscious. A LOUD STEADY BUZZ sounds from one of the
machines behind her as blood begins to leak out of Trevor's
ear. Allison jumps up and hits call button above Trevor's
bed.

                       ALLISON (CONT'D)
          CODE BLUE!

She yanks Trevor's johnnie down, wheels a defribulator over
to his dying body and grabs the paddles.

                    ALLISON (CONT'D)
          It's okay Trevor I'm coming for you.

Allison rubs the paddles together, presses the paddles
against Trevor's chest and-

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY

-Trevor sits bolt upright in his bed. His alarm clock is
making that same BUZZING noise.




                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             31.

Trevor is completely disoriented. He sees a note laying next
to him on the bed. It says ìYou're an animal baby... you-know-
who...î He finally looks at the clock. Seven forty five.

                       TREVOR
             Shit, I'm gonna be late!

INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY

Trevor is on his computer typing madly. ON THE SCREEN WE SEE
he has accessed the local newspaper. He calls up an article
reading: ACCIDENT LEAVES ONE HOSPITALIZED ANOTHER MISSING.

He looks at a newspaper picture of the bridge, which is
humming with rescue activity.

Trevor's head is pounding. He goes into his desk drawer and
pulls out a bottle of aspirin.

Trevor empties the last of the bottle's six tablets into his
hand, downs them, chases them with what's left of an economy
sized bottle of Mylanta. Trevor can't seem to even look at
his computer screen. He hears a DING-DING and looks up.

He has an instant office message waiting. Trevor clicks OK.
The instant message reads: ìIT'S TOO LATE.î Trevor rapidly
types up. ìWHO IS THIS.î The same message is repeated. ìIT'S
TOO LATE. IT'S TOO LATE. IT'S TOO LATE.î

Trevor stands up and looks around mazelike structure of
cubicles as far as he can see. All of his co-workers are
slaving away on their keypads. Trevor sits back down and
cancels the instant message. He ruminates for a moment.

From behind Bret's fingers TAPPING on the keyboard seem to
get louder, more frustrated. They finally stop and Bret
stretches momentarily.

                       BRET
             Must be nice.

                       TREVOR
             What?

                       BRET
             Getting paid for doing shit.

Bret goes back to work again, fingers HAMMERING away.

                       TREVOR
             Come on, Bret.



                                                  (CONTINUED)

                       BRET
             Seriously man, you oughta work for the
             government. You've got the sense of
             urgency for it.

Trevor himself begins to type, slowly, reluctantly.

                       TREVOR
             Look, I'm doing my best considering okay?

                       BRET
             Hey if the boss doesn't notice who cares
             right? Just slack all the live long day
             if you want.

                       TREVOR
             The boss won't notice me doing a bad job
             because I'm not. Even if the boss thought
             I was slacking I'd know right away.

                       BRET
             Yeah, how's that?

                        TREVOR
                 (smug)
             I have my connections

                       BRET
             Really? Do tell.

                       TREVOR
                 (smiling)
             Gwen.

Bret freezes. He then looks at Trevor, eyes bulging.

                       BRET
             GWEN?

                       TREVOR
             I crap you not. She was all over me
             yesterday in the break room. And she was
             a total machine last night too.

                       BRET
             You were supposed to have a date with
             Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The
             supervisor?

                       TREVOR
             Serious as a heart attack my friend. I
             think she literally fucked me brains out.

                    BRET
              (super sarcastic)
          Wow that's quite a feat Trevor
          congratulations. Must be really tough to
          get your brains fucked out by a CORPSE.

Trevor stops and looks at Bret.

                    TREVOR
          What are you talking about?

                     BRET
          Me? This is your sick joke man. Gwen was
          murdered here six months ago. The
          security guard found her all over her
          office. Her head was in the waste paper
          basket. Her stomach was in the filing
          cabinet. Her ass was on the copy
          machine...

Trevor is speechless.

                    BRET (CONT'D)
          They never found the sicko who did it...
          remember?

Trevor still can't speak. He goes into his computer mailbox
and re-opens the file he'd received from ìYou Know Who.î

He stifles a scream when he sees the jpegs have changed. Sure
they're still of Gwen. Pieces of her swimming in puddles of
her own blood. Where it once said ìWork harderî it now says
ìPolice File.î

                    TREVOR
              (to himself)
          Jesus Christ...

Trevor looks behind him to make sure Bret hasn't seen any of
this. He's facing his own computer typing away.

                    BRET
          Man are you ever out of the loop. Either
          that or you've got the worst sense of
          humor this side of Jeffrey Dahmer. What
          is your problem anyway?

Trevor quickly deletes the entire file. Finally...

                                                             34.
CONTINUED: (3)


                    TREVOR
          Honestly Bret? I think I lost my mind.
          And now I'm finding pieces of it, like
          pieces of a wrecked car, scattered on
          the side of the road.

A beat.

                    BRET
          Bud you need to decompress. I told you
          you came back to work too soon after the
          accident.

Trevor says nothing.

                    BRET (CONT'D)
          Hey you know what Trev? I'm going to hook
          you up man. Here...

Bret wheels across the cubicle on his chair and hands
something to Trevor. It's an oddly designed postcard bearing
some sort of voodoo mask. The font is faux-Oriental, the kind
they use for Chinese take-out menus. He looks closer. It's an
appointment card for an acupuncturist. Sage.

                    BRET (CONT'D)
          This woman will take one look at you and
          know exactly what you need.

INT. SAGE'S OFFICE - DAY

A chart of all the puncture points on the human body is
tacked to the wall.

Trevor lies on the table. SAGE, a gorgeous ethereal Indian
woman is at the far end, hovering over the soles of his feet,
sticking pins into the appropriate places. She looks up at
him slyly.

                    SAGE
          These headaches you've been getting. Do
          they happen in conjunction with the
          hallucinations?

Sage walks over to one of the cabinets, gathering more
acupuncture needles. Trevor can't help but notice her shapely
body, her feline gait. Sage throws a sultry glance over her
shoulder at him, prompting him to finally answer her
question.

                    TREVOR
              (unsure of himself)
          Yes, sort of.

                       TREVOR (cont'd)
             My head's been in constant pain since
             the... accident. And the pain increases
             whenever I, uh... slip into another, I
             don't know what to call them...

Sage comes back to him, several needles in one hand. She
looks into his eyes.

                       SAGE
             Dreams?

                       TREVOR
             I was going to say dimensions. But I
             guess technically they are dreams.

                       SAGE
             You should always listen to your
             subconscious. It's trying to tell you
             something about your waking life.

Sage begins applying the needles fluidly to his upper body
now.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
             But I never feel like I'm sleeping. It's
             sort of, waking narcolepsy. I'll be
             somewhere and then-
                 (snapping his fingers)
             -it's like I was never wherever I was to
             begin with I was really somewhere else
             entirely.

Sage puts the last needle in. For the first time Trevor
actually feels a releief of pressure in his head.

                       TREVOR (cont'd)
             Ok, whatever that was...do it again.
             That just set me free of the worlds
             longest head ache. Is this making any
             sense?

                       SAGE (CONT'D)
             None whatsoever. Now just relax. Let the
             needles do the driving.

A PHONE OUTSIDE THE OFFICE RINGS. Sage looks up at the door.

                       SAGE (CONT'D)
                 (patting his cheek)
             Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

Trevor watches Sage EXIT the office. He lies there a moment,
bathing in warm sunshine. He is relaxed, pain free.

CONTINUED: (2)


Behind him, an acupuncture anatomy chart on the wall. Which
begins to change its shape. It morphs (or economically
changes) into PINHEAD.

Trevor is oblivious as PINHEAD approaches, doll eyes
betraying no feeling whatsoever. Then, Pinhead reaches up to
his head and begins pulling out one of those infamous pins.
It takes a while to come out.

Because it is a foot long. Once out, the needle drips with
black ooze.

Trevor hears a noise and believes its Sage who's reentered
the room.

                    TREVOR
          I'm thinking this might just be what I
          needed.

Pinhead speaks but in Sages voice. As he pushes on of the
pins into the tip Trevors skin in his back .

                    PINHEAD
          No matter what happens just remember...

Before Trevor can react, Pinhead suddenly jabs the pin down
into Trevor's back, pinning him to the table! It sears his
skin. In Pinheads recognizable voice...

                    PINHEAD (CONT'D)
          We're all here for you Trevor.

As Trevor reels in terror, Pinhead pulls another foot long
needle from his head and thrusts this one into his neck! WE
SEE the needle come right out the other side, nailing itself
into the table. Trevor can't believe he's still alive!

Pinhead pulls one more out, aims this one at Trevor's arm,
and swings down.

                                                    quick cuts:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Allison pokes Trevor's arm with a hypodermic. She places a
reassuring hand on his chest. Machines behind her are PINGING
and BUZZING like crazy. Allison looks a little worried.

                    ALLISON
          Shh. It's okay. Go back to sleep.

Allison blurs out of focus...

... then briefly comes back into focus...

... only now it's A MAN INSIDE A DARKENED ROOM.

INT. DARKENED ROOM - DAY

TREVOR'S POV: Buried in the murky shadow, all that can be
seen are his hands, lit by a shaft of sunlight beaming
through a blinded window. A ring on the man's left pinky
finger glimmers eerily, almost too much. We saw this man in
an earlier FLASHBACK

He's holding something. The cube. He speaks in an ECHOED and
DISTORTED VOICE.

                       DARKENED MAN
             I know. Divorce isn't good enough.
             Abandonment isn't good enough. There's
             only one way to do it and do it cleanly,
             without leaving a trace of evidence.

The darkened man pushes the cube across the desk towards us.

                       DARKENED MAN (CONT'D)
             Open this and your problem will disappear
             forever. And no one will ever suspect
             you. A word of caution though. A certain
             side effect of the box. Pleasure.
             Pleasures that would redefine the
             parameters of sensation.

Trevors picks up the cube.


                       DARKENED MAN (CONT'D)
             Once the cube is opened there is no
             turning back. Ever.

A LOUD BUZZING NOISE BEGINS drowning out the darkened man's
words as we:

                                                    dissolve to:

INT. TREVOR'S BEDROOM - DAY

Trevor quietly wakes up to the sound of his alarm BUZZING
again. He stares at the ceiling.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Trevor pushes through the front doors and a RECEPTIONIST
greets him with a big smile and a business card.

             Afternoon doll-face. Hey, a police
             detective was just here to see you.
                 (looking at the card)
             Some guy named Givens.

She hands the card to him batting her eyelashes. Trevor looks
at the card as she checks out his package. Trevor reads the
word HOMICIDE.

                       TREVOR
             Uh thanks this looks a little important.
             Could you let the folks upstairs know
             I'll be late?

                       RECEPTIONIST
             For you bubbalicious?
                 (winking)
             I'd lay across a bed of nails.

Trevor walks back OUT and the receptionist watches him go.
Another female employee walks by staring at Trevor. She looks
at the receptionist and they both nod in agreement.

                       RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
             You know it girl. That ass is a three-
             hummer baby. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

INT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY

Same office only Trevor is sitting at the other desk across
from a hawklike MAN who is playing with a yoyo. This is
GIVENS. If good cop bad cop is the scheme here, he's the
latter.

                        TREVOR
             I'm sorry. I still... I don't understand
             how this is a homicide case. I mean
             nobody was murdered here... Her body's
             been missing for I don't know how long
             now and...

                       GIVENS
             What did you just say?

                       TREVOR
             I said she's been missing for-

                       GIVENS
             No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.

                       TREVOR
             What's the difference?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                39.

                       GIVENS
             Last time anybody saw this woman she was
             alive. You seem to certain she's dead.

                        TREVOR
                 (tearing up)
             I saw her drowning inside the car,
             detective.

                       GIVENS
             I read up on you, man. You're a smart guy
             aren't you? I mean with numbers. Right?

                       TREVOR
             You could say that.

                       GIVENS
             Zero's a number right?

                       TREVOR
             As in one minus one equals zero yes.
             Where are you going with this?

                       GIVENS
             How many zeros was your wife worth?

Brow furrowing, Trevor stands up.

                       TREVOR
             I need to talk to my attorney. Now.

Givens pushes his phone toward Trevor, who takes it and dials
furiously. Givens remains poker-faced. Trevor dials a number.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
                 (into phone)
             Yes I need LARRY ELLIS' office please.

He says the lawyer's name like it's supposed to intimidate
Givens. He couldn't care less.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
                 (a beat)
             Yeah this is Trevor Gooding I need to
             speak with Larry... Trevor...? Kirsty
             Gooding's husband...?
                 (another beat)
             I see do you know when he'll be out that
             meeting? Fine I'll uh... call back
             then... Okay you give him the message and
             he'll call me that's great.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

With that Trevor hangs up the phone and EXITS the office.
Givens BUSTS OUT LAUGHING.

INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY

Trevor types bitterly on the computer crunching numbers like
a madman.

                    BRET
          I don't know what pissed you off but it's
          nice to see you getting the job done for
          a change.

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT

Trevor plays his videogame with venom. The cries of his kills
emanate from the TV, building to a crescendo. Finally we hear
a WOMAN'S VOICE come from the TV.

                    WOMAN'S VOICE
          I'M SAVED! MY HERO!

Trevor flicks the REPLAY button.

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT

Trevor stares at the self-taken picture of him and his wife
mugging at the camera. What is it that Kirsty is holding?

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT

The TV is on. Trevor flips through the channels. He stops on
the Nature Channel. A goat is casually munching on some nuts
and berries.

                    ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE
              (from TV)
          -at the dawning of the agrarian age
          goat's milk would be considered a
          suitable substitute for a mother's breast
          milk. And the sacrifice of a goat would
          appease an angry god and ensure a
          bountiful harvest. But in time the ritual
          would become associated with less
          hallowed purposes.

HEADLINE: CHURCH DESECRATED WITH BLOOD OF GOAT, LAMB

                    ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D)
          Goat's blood is said to hold supernatural
          properties linked to black magic.

                       ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D)
             In conjunction with the pentangle- the
             five pointed star- the spilling of goat's
             blood is considered to be either an
             aphrodisiac that can be used in demonic
             orgies, or a means by which a high priest
             may summon Satan himself.

AN ILLUSTRATION of a goat with many eyes appears on the
screen.

                       ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                 (from TV)
             The Book of Revelations speaks of the
             anti-Christ as the beast with many eyes.
             For centuries illustrators have chosen a
             goat to represent this beast.

His eyes hurting too much to watch any more, Trevor turns the
TV off. Out of sheer instinct he suddenly turns to look-

-OUT HIS WINDOW:

The apartment across the street is lit. A STRANGE FIGURE is
standing in the window.

Trevor jumps up and rushes over to his window. He looks OUT
at that same shadowy man he saw earlier. The man's face is
still obscured and is still holding something in a blanket.
Squinting Trevor is able to make out what it is:

A SLEEPING BABY. The stranger pulls the baby's blanket over
the baby's angelic face. Then the light in that apartment
goes out abruptly.

Trevor stares at the darkened window breathing heavily. Is
the stranger still in there, watching Trevor in the dark?
Trevor cannot tell.

A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR makes him flinch.

Trevor goes to the door, opens it to find:

TAWNY. Only now she's dressed in a skintight black rubber
dress. She smiles accentuating a fresh coat of black
lipstick.

                       TAWNY
             Hey. Can I borrow something?

                       TREVOR
             Uh... sure, Tawny... what?

                       TAWNY
             You.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                           42.
CONTINUED: (2)


Tawny grabs the back of his neck, pulling him to her as she
kisses him deeply. She grabs his collar and pulls him out to
the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

She turns around, leading Trevor through the hall like a
horse. A very confused horse.

                    TREVOR
          Tawny? What's- what are you doing?

                       TAWNY
          YOU!

Trevor eyes her gorgeous body and decides not to resist quite
so much.

INT. TAWNY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Trevor leans against the counter, sipping at a glass of wine
nervously. Right next to him, Tawny's at the stove, stirring
a pot of something dark and bubbly. She looks up at him,
smiling seductively. But Trevor's still a few lengths behind.

                       TAWNY
          You okay?

                    TREVOR
          I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of
          weird actually.

                       TAWNY
          Really?

Tawny grabs Trevor's balls and he jumps away as if jolted by
a cattle-prod.

                    TAWNY (CONT'D)
          I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!

                    TREVOR
          I've never said this to a woman before
          but can't we talk a little bit before
          grabbing at each other?

                    TAWNY
              (grinning)
          God. Sometimes you can be such an animal.
          Other times you are the ultimate tease...

She holds up a spoonful of what she's been stirring. It looks
like stew.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                43.

                       TAWNY (CONT'D)
             Taste this.

Keeping a hand below his waist Trevor leans toward the spoon,
tastes, licks his lips. Then squints.

                       TREVOR
             Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?

                       TAWNY
             For starters. It's also got fennel,
             asparagus, olives, some more of mother
             nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college,
             me and my roommates used to call it hard-
             on stew.

                       TREVOR
             Not a very appetizing name.

                       TAWNY
             Have some more.

Trevor takes another sip of it.

                       TAWNY (CONT'D)
             If you ever smelled this coming from our
             dorm room, you knew one of us was in
             there getting laid.

                       TREVOR
             You must have been very proud of
             yourselves...

                       TAWNY
             It's getting hot in here.

Tawny summarily unzips her rubber dress and whips it off.

Trevor is speechless.

Tawny's body is covered with bites and bruises.

                       TREVOR
             Jesus... who did that to you?

Tawny BUSTS OUT LAUGHING.

                       TAWNY
             You're kidding right?

Trevor shakes his head no.

                                                             44.

                    TAWNY (CONT'D)
          You did! God, you are funny tonight.

Tawny approaches Trevor who tenses up.

                    TAWNY (CONT'D)
          Almost like I'm with somebody else.

Trevor starts looking very ill.

                    TREVOR
          Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.

                    TAWNY
          Well now there's a compliment.

Trevor grabs his stomach, lurching over. He can't breath.
Trevor looks up at Tawny. But it is no longer her. Tawny has
changed into something else entirely.

A CENOBITE.

The Cenobite rips Trevor's shirt open, and we can see
movement within his abdomen. Like a baby kicking. Whatever's
in their shoots up expanding Trevor's chest cavity.

The Cenobite pins Trevor to the wall and hovers in his face
as if about to kiss him.

Before Trevor can scream he is choking. The Cenobite watches
with glee as something begins to move up into Trevor's
throat, expanding his neck, forcing his jaws open and
finally...

... a BLACK EEL pokes its head out of Trevor's mouth. The
Cenobite opens its own mouth and the eel starts to crawl
inside it. Meanwhile Trevor's about to pass out from
asphyxiation when-

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

-he takes a deep grateful breath through an oxygen mask. The
various pieces of monitoring equipment around him are BEEPING
and PINGING like slot machines.

Allison walks around the room pressing buttons that silent
each machine one by one, then walks up to the bed, looking
surprisingly calm.

                    ALLISON
          Sorry about that. There was a blockage in
          your oxygen hose. Won't happen again,
          promise.

Trevor looks relieved. Shell-shocked but relieved.

                       TREVOR
             I'm certainly keeping you busy huh?

                       ALLISON
                 (smiling)
             Too bad I hate my job...

She strokes his forehead.

                       ALLISON (CONT'D)
             Feeling better now?

Trevor shakes his head.

                       TREVOR
             These hallucinations I'm having. I think
             they're more like memories coming back to
             me in a strange way.

                       ALLISON
             Well that's not necessarily a bad thing
             is it?

                       TREVOR
             If they're blocked memories... I'm
             starting to realize the reason why I
             blocked them out. Allison I think I
             really... screwed everything up.

                       ALLISON
             Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.

                       TREVOR
             I miss her. I miss my wife.

Trevor takes her hand. Allison looks briefly around her
then... climbs onto the bed with him.

                       ALLISON
             If you need to cry, go ahead. I won't
             tell.

Holding her hand to his face, Trevor closes his eyes,
squeezing out a tear.

CLOSE ON TREVOR'S FACE. WE start to NOTICE subtle differences
about Allison's hand. It is very pale, the fingernails black.

Trevor opens his eyes.

                                                          46.



INT. TAWNY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING

He is now lying on Tawny's bed, which is surrounded by unlit
candles. Sunlight streams through her open window. It is her
hand he is holding to his face. The rest of her is sitting
under the sheet, covered head propped against the headboard.

Trevor drops her hand and it falls lifelessly to the bed
beside him. Breathing quickening he reaches up to the black
silk sheet covering her head. He yanks it back and covers his
mouth in horror.

She's been bound to the bed and gagged with a white cloth
that is soaked with blood. A deep vertical incision has been
made in her neck, collarbone to chin and her tongue is pulled
through the wound so it sticks out the bottom of her jaw. And
that's just for starters.

When Trevor looks down he gags when he sees her ribcage has
been opened like a set of French doors and her insides
sitting in her lap.

The coup de grace? Trevor now sees he is covered with blood.
HERS.

INT. TREVOR'S APT., BATHROOM - DAY

Trevor splashes his face with cold water, trying to get his
composure back. He stares at the water rushing down the drain
for a moment. His breathing stabilizes He finally looks up at
his reflection in the mirror...

... to see PINHEAD staring back at him.

Trevor jolts backward in shock and does a double take. It's
him now, looking completely unhinged.

Outside the PHONE RINGS. The answering machine picks up with
a BEEP.

                    LANGE'S VOICE
              (from answering machine)
          This is Lange. We need to talk as soon as
          possible. It's about your little...
          dilemma. Give me a call.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Cleaned up now Trevor carefully makes his way back to Tawny's
apartment. He tries the door. It's locked. This can't be
right. He jiggles the door knob violently, then finally KICKS
the door.

Suddenly-

-TAWNY answers the door, looking utterly pissed off. Though
still in Goth mode, she's dressed much more conservatively
now.

                       TAWNY
             Can I help you?

                       TREVOR
             Tawny... I- you're-

Trevor goes to embrace her. She shrinks back, startled.

                       TAWNY
             Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude.
             What do you want?

                       TREVOR
             I... think we need to talk, there's
             something really strange going on...

                       TAWNY
                 (a look of recognition)
             Hey you're the guy from down the hall.

                       TREVOR
             Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's
             about... what we did together last night.

                       TAWNY
                 (utterly shocked)
             WHAT?!

A VERY DEEP VOICE comes from somewhere behind her.

                       VOICE
             Who the fuck is that?

                       TAWNY
             It's that guy from down the hall. He
             thinks we did something with him last
             night.

                       TREVOR
             Who's- who's in there with you...?

Tawny looks aghast.

                       TAWNY
             Are you cracking up or something?

Suddenly an enormous BRUTE of a MAN, wide as he is tall
ENTERS the doorway. He's wearing a black tee, black jeans
and, Trevor can't help notice, black nail polish... on
fingers and toes. Obviously Tawny's significant other.

                    BRUTE
          What can we do for you, chief?

                    TREVOR
          I... who are you?

Brute takes a sideward step through the doorway, forcing
Trevor back two steps.

                    BRUTE
          You know Tawny, you better know me, pal.

                    TREVOR
          Okay. I don't want any trouble. I was
          mistaken... I'll see you later.

                    BRUTE
          Much.

Trevor turns and hurries off. Brute turns to Tawny who shrugs
and makes a twirly motion at her temple. The two go back into
her apartment.

INT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY

Trevor paces in his apartment telephone to his ear. He lets
out a heavy breath and looks at his watch. Finally:

          City police main switchboard how may I
          direct your call?

                    TREVOR
          You already asked me that ten minutes ago
          just before you put me on hold. I'm
          looking for defective- I mean Detective
          Lange.

                    OPERATOR
          Oh he and his partner just stepped out to
          lunch, can I-?

Trevor hangs up.

                                                             49.



INT. BUS - DAY

Trevor sits at the front of the bus agitated. He folds and
unfolds Detective Lange's business card in his hands like
some frustrated Origami artist.

The SIREN from a passing ambulance drills his ears. The
irritating sound eventually fades away but the pain in his
head is still there.

The BONGING of a distant cathedral's bell makes him pause. He
looks around.

Toward the rear and sees a familiar old lady knitting a
baby's bootie. He looks again. The bootie is bright red and
dripping... blood? Trevor follows the strand of bright red
wool down to their source:

A DYING GOAT laying under the seat. It's insides have been
ripped out. Its veins and tendons are serving as the old
lady's yarn.

Trevor's eyes bolt back up to the old woman. She continues
HUMMING sweetly, her lap speckled with goat's blood. Trevor
pulls the wire and an OBNOXIOUS BUZZING goes off. Trevor
hurries up to the bus driver as the bus pulls over.

                    TREVOR
          Just open the doors I'll jump off.

                    BUS DRIVER
          Not while the bus is moving, sir.

Trevor clutches his head in pain and waits for the bus to
stop. The doors open. He jumps off, knees nearly buckling
from the pain. He looks up as the bus speeds off.

IN THE REAR WINDOW the little black girl seen earlier pops
up. She's holding her little doll. She pushes a clothespin
into its head. Blood drips from the puncture. At the same
time Trevor feels an incredible pain sear through his head.
He squints at the bus again. The little girl is gone.

INT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY

Lange is at his desk eating a sandwich. Trevor comes in
angrier than a hornet in a beehive.

                    TREVOR
          Where's my wife Detective Lange? What the
          hell did you do with her?!



                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                                50.

                       LANGE
             Mr. Gooding I assure you we are doing
             everything within our-

                       TREVOR
             Why did you leave me that message?

                       LANGE
             I don't know what you're talking about.

Trevor SLAMS his hand down on Lange's desk and gets right in
his face.

                       TREVOR
             LIAR!

Trevor immediately turns around and walks OUT.

INT. LARRY ELLIS' OFFICE - DAY

LARRY ELLIS is a somber but handsome young attorney. At
present he at his desk poring through several books on child
custody law. He makes notes on a pad beside him as he talks.

                       LARRY
                 (not looking up)
             Basically they know where your wife's
             body is and they're not telling you as a
             tactic to get you to confess? Yet neither
             of them has come out and told you that
             you're a suspect. Is that what you're
             trying to say?

Trevor sits on the other side of the humongous office in a
chair so big it practically swallows him whole.

                       TREVOR
             Look Larry I know you never thought too
             much of me. And I know this all sounds a
             little fucked up.

                       LARRY
             A little? Try unbelievably.

                       TREVOR
             I swear these guys are like playing
             mindgames with me. I think they got a
             hold of my e-mail address at work too.

Larry is not buying this for a nanosecond. He trims some
brown leaves off a small plant as he speaks.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                       LARRY
             Trevor barring the more outrageous
             aspects of your claim you are not the
             only widower the police have questioned
             when foul play is suspected.

                       TREVOR
             Hey ninety five point three percent of
             all murders are committed by either a
             spouse, a direct relative or a close
             friend that's common knowledge. But this
             wasn't murder it was an accident-

                       LARRY
                 (concentrating on his notes)
             And as far as hiding a body goes? I find
             it hard to believe even the dirtiest of
             cops would keep a victim's remains hidden
             simply to get someone to confess. It's
             absolutely preposterous. Now I'm not
             saying I don't believe you,
             I'm....ambiguous. There's quite alot of
             money behind all this.

                       TREVOR
             How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty
             is presumed dead?

Larry sighs and walks over to his desk. He presses a button
on his intercom.

                       LARRY
             Rosie can you bring in the Gooding
             papers?

                       ASSISTANT'S VOICE
                 (from intercom)
             Right away Mr. Ellis.

                       TREVOR
             Uh. Ballpark would be fine Larry.

                       LARRY
             In the vicinity of eight million four
             hundred fifty thousand. Or is it sixty-

                       TREVOR
             What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's
             murder?

                       LARRY
             Well they'd have to prove it in a court
             of law for one thing-

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                          52.
CONTINUED: (2)


                    TREVOR
          Please Larry. Pretend you like me and
          humor me.

                    LARRY
          Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and
          I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's
          entire estate would have to be donated to
          the city.

                    TREVOR
          Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking
          conspiracy!

                    LARRY
          Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound
          like a raving lunatic. The next time you
          seek counsel it should be of the
          psychiatric type. You're obviously on the
          verge of some nervous collapse.

                    TREVOR
          Thanks for your concern Larry. And fuck
          you too.

Trevor gets up and heads for the door.

                    LARRY
              (to Trevor's back)
          I never thought your late wife was the
          sharpest knife in the drawer. But
          marrying you was the dumbest thing she
          ever did!

On his way out Trevor nearly runs down Larry's ASSISTANT who
was just coming IN with a large file. Trevor's gone.

INT. CAB - DAY

Trevor looks despondently out the window. The cab stops and
Trevor hands some money to the CABBIE up front.

                    TREVOR
          You can go. I'm going to be here a while.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

Trevor gets out of the cab, which drives off leaving him on
the bridge looking down at the water below.

                                                             53.



EXT. BELOW BRIDGE - DAY

Police tape FLAPS between the trees. Other than that there is
no sign of an investigation. Trevor walks out of the woods on
the shore, through the police tape and to the water's edge.

He begins to walk the shore looking out at the still water.
He scans the area where the water meets the land, trying to
remember.

Something on the surface few feet away catches his eye. It's
a rock sticking up. No it's something else. Trevor walks
right up to the water and puts his feet on a couple of large
rocks breaking the surface. He bends down and looks at...

THE CORNER OF A BLACK CUBE. He quickly reaches down, tries to
pick it up. It seems to be stuck just below the surface.
Trevor pulls harder and finally it gives. Trevor slowly lifts
the black cube out of the water and GASPS when he sees-

-A WHITE WATERLOGGED HAND CLUTCHING IT FROM BELOW!

Trevor GASPS and lets go. And just as the cube (along with
its owner) SPLASH under the surface-

-ANOTHER WHITE HAND breaks the surface grabbing Trevor's
wrist!

As Trevor Struggles he looks up to see the dark figure
standing above him holding a rock over his head. Just as he
swings down towards Trevors head-

                                                smash cut to:

INT. ALLISON'S OFFICE - DAY

Trevor jumps scaring the hell out of Allison who has just
gotten done taking his pulse.

                    ALLISON
          Jesus I wish you would stop doing that.

Trevor looks down at himself. He's on an examination table in
his normal clothes not a hospital johnnie. That's a good
sign.

                       TREVOR
          Allison...

Trevor tries to put his thoughts together.




                                                     (CONTINUED)

                       ALLISON
             Well Trevor? What have you got to say for
             yourself? Que pasa?

                       TREVOR
                 (voice quivering)
             Allison we have GOT to talk about this
             medication you've got me on.

                       ALLISON
             I'm all over it.

Allison shines a penlight in his eye.

                       ALLISON (CONT'D)
             Blink.

Trevor blinks. Satisfied, Allison sits on the bed next to
Trevor and takes his hand.

                       ALLISON (CONT'D)
             Okay. What we're going to do is up the
             Topomax to two per day instead of one,
             see if that takes care of these
             hallucinatory seizures you've been
             having. The extra Topomax won't interfere
             with the painkillers either but... You're
             going to be thrilled to hear this part
             but we have been told by some patients it
             affects the memory somewhat...

                       TREVOR
                 (weary)
             Really? Does it affect the memory?

Allison looks concerned. Then her features soften.

                       ALLISON
             You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding.
             You keep coming back to your corner for a
             quick fix up then go right back out into
             the ring for another round.

                        TREVOR
             Some call it resilience. Others,
             stupidity.

Allison lets a lapse in the conversation last too long. That
look of concern returns as she lingers on his face. She's
trying to say something.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
             Everything okay Allison?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

               outflow)
          Of course, yes.

                    TREVOR
          The way you just looked at me...

                    ALLISON
          I know, my bedside manner's horrendous.

Allison finishes writing a few notes, and Trevors rolls down
his sleves. He's intrigued.

                    TREVOR
          So, I'm done. Thats it for today?

                    ALLISON
          All finished.

Neither of them want this visit to be over.

                    TREVOR (cont'd)
          How bout some lunch?

INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

The two share the end of an empty cafeteria table, eating off
pastel colored trays.

                    TREVOR
          Think about it. In the entire world
          where's the most life-threatening place
          you could possibly be at any given
          moment.

                    ALLISON
          I don't know... Beirut? New Orleans?

                    TREVOR
          Hint. It's not a geographical location.

                    ALLISON
          I'm stumped.

                    TREVOR
          It's inside a moving car.

             car accidents than did during the entire
             span of World War II.

                       ALLISON
             Okay so... what's the safest place?

                       TREVOR
             Statistically speaking? Inside a moving
             bus.

Allison LAUGHS.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
             Millions of people around the world get
             on busses every day. When was the last
             time you heard of anybody anywhere dying
             on a public transit bus?

                       ALLISON
             Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you.
             What's the most common cause of death for
             adults over the age of eighteen?

                       TREVOR
             Please. Heart attack. That was easy
             street.

                       ALLISON
             Second most common?

             Eighty third most common.

They both chuckle, Trevor's expression gets serious. After a
moment of silence.

          relationship somehow. (to himself) Bad
          choice of words.

          guy. I see these women, they think I'm
          someone else, and I'm not that guy
          anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.

                    ALLISON
          You were unfaithful, it sounds like your
          confessing.

          I did more then that.

Allison reaches accross the table for Trevors hand. A quiet
moment.

          Com'on.   How bout some fresh air?

EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY

Trevor and Allison sit in a couple of chairs looking out at
the other rooftops around them.

                    TREVOR
          Lucky for us these chairs happened to be
          here.

                    ALLISON
          Oh I knew about the chairs already. This
          is where the emphysema patients come to
          sneak cigarettes.

She points to the ground at myriad butts scattered at their
feet. Trevor smiles and looks at his hands.

                    ALLISON (CONT'D)
          Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke?

                     TREVOR

             Sure plenty of times.

                       TREVOR
             Well?

                       ALLISON
             Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep
             state they are obviously dreaming. So
             practically everything say is going to
             sound strange.

                       TREVOR
             Did I ever talk about the accident?

                       ALLISON
             No.

                       TREVOR
             Did I ever talk about Kirsty?

                       ALLISON
             No. But at one point you did repeat
             something though. A phrase. You must have
             been having this recurring dream, you
             just kept saying this one thing over and
             over

                       TREVOR
             What was it?

                       ALLISON
             You said, "Jealousy arouses a husbands
             fury, and he will show no mercy when he
             takes revenge." (Proverbs 6:34) Does that
             mean anything to you Trevor?

                       TREVOR
             It means I have alot more questions.

Trevor stares off into the distance.

                       ALLISON
             Times up for today. I've got to get back.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

Allison SMILES and pats Trevor's knee. He melts and puts his
hand on hers. She slowly takes it away and fixes her hair.

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
          Sorry.

                    ALLISON
          If it makes you feel better that took
          every ounce of self control I had.
          Trevor, I never date patients.

                    TREVOR
          I understand... I won't-

                    ALLISON
          No you don't understand. That's why I've
          been fighting to get you better. So you
          wouldn't be a patient anymore.

                    TREVOR
          Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would
          have switched doctors!

                    ALLISON
          Just get better okay?

She caresses his face then looks at her watch.

                    ALLISON (CONT'D)
          I have to get back to work. And so do
          you.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Trevor walks through the maze of cubicles a big smile on his
face. He's actually having a good day.

INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY

Bret's already looking up at Trevor as he ENTERS.

                    TREVOR
          Don't say a word, Bret.

Trevor's smile disappears when he sees someone's already
sitting in his chair. LANGE. He's on Trevor's computer
surfing the internet.

                    BRET
              (to Lange)
          Guess I'll leave you two alone.

                                                             60.

                 (concentrating on the computer)
             Nice chatting with ya.

Bret gets up and LEAVES as Trevor approaches Lange.

                       LANGE (CONT'D)
             Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?

                       TREVOR
             No please make yourself at home.

Trevor sits in Bret's chair as Lange logs off and swivels to
face Trevor.

                       LANGE
             How's everything, Mr. Gooding?

                       TREVOR
             Can't we dispense with the games for
             once?

                       LANGE
             I thought you loved games.

                       TREVOR
             I'll just stay out of this conversation
             until you come out and tell me why you've
             disrupted me at work.

                       LANGE
             You and your wife were playing a game
             shortly before you got into that car
             accident weren't you?

                       TREVOR
             Where is she? Where is my wife?

Lange shakes his head and pulls something else out of his
pocket. It's The Cube sealed in a ziploc. Trevor cannot
conceal a feeling of dread.

                       LANGE
             We found this curious little object not
             too far from the site of the accident. No
             prints but forensics scraped a little
             dark residue that was caked on one of the
             corners. It was blood Trevor. Matched
             some blood we took off your car seat too.
             Can you tell me anything about it?

              (to Lange)
          It looks familiar. I think it was in the
          car...

                    LANGE
          Gee you think so?

Lange puts the cube back in his pocket and stands up.

                    LANGE (CONT'D)
          Sorry to take up your time like that
          Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I
          forget. I talked your neighbor out of
          pressing charges.

                    TREVOR
          What?

                    LANGE
          The whackjob in the black lipstick who
          lives down the hall? She wanted you
          arrested for harassment. I told her to
          chill out and smoke a joint. I'd look the
          other way as long as she did you know?

                    TREVOR
          Thanks.

                    LANGE
          We're all here for you Trevor.

Lange gets up and EXITS. Trevor satys seated, after a beat he
stands up looking over his cubicle and sees DET. GIVENS
staring back at him from the door. Trevors sits back down.
Trevor suddenly clutches his head as if it's been killing him
this whole time. He goes to his chair picks up the phone and
dials.

                    RECORDING (V.O.)
              (from phone)
          We're sorry the number you have has
          either been disconnected or no longer in
          service. If you feel you have reached
          this recording in error-

Trevor hangs up. We can almost hear his head throbbing in
pain.

He turns around and there's BRET LEANING AGAINST his desk
eating a frozen yogurt. Staring at Trevor.

                    BRET
          Frogurt guy's here. They're all out
          chocolate vanilla swirl or I'd have
          gotten you one.

                    TREVOR
          I'm sure you would have.

Bret nods, tosses the frozen yogurt container out and sits
down.

                    BRET
          Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like
          to buy you a beer after work. Be just
          like old times.

                    TREVOR
          What's the occasion?

                    BRET
          I quit. Today's my last day.

This hits Trevor like a ton of bricks.

INT. PUB - DAY

The place is practically empty. Bret and Trevor play darts
and work on a pitcher of beer. Country Western plays on the
jukebox.

                    BRET
          I've got a better offer. More time off. A
          sort of career shift, more in the
          engineering line of work.

                    TREVOR
          How much time off?

                    BRET
          As much as he feels like. Its a much more
          pleasurable line of work.

                    TREVOR
          As much as he likes?

                    BRET
          Yahtzee. Were all in this together Trev.
          Trevor there are people who are doing
          exactly what we're doing but they don't
          need to wear a tie, punch a clock or have
          some tight assed supervisor breathing
          down their necks. Its all about the
          pleasure Trevor!

                                                  (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                       TREVOR
             So you're just packing it up just like
             that?

                        BRET
             Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends
             to tie up first. Came into a shitload of
             money recently. I've always wanted to go
             to take a trip. We're just gonna walk
             into the airport and decide right then
             and there.

                       TREVOR
             Yeah? You and who else?

                       BRET
             Someone special.

Bret throws a dart with extra mph. It misses the board
entirely and hits the wall. Trevor winces in pain suddenly.
He touches his head and looks at his fingers. Fresh blood.

FLASHBACK

Trevor in the car in the water. Thrashing about, he bleeding
from his head in the flashback as well. Where's Kristy? He
looks in the passenger seat. She's gone.

Trevor takes the cube from the man with the ring. He fumbles
with the puzzle box in the darkness.

CU box.   It starts to move.

Trevor driving with Kristy, She's going down on him while
he's driving.


                      KIRSTY
             Okay pull over.

                       TREVOR
                 (looking at his watch)
             But... I thought...

Trevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding.

                       KIRSTY
                 (through clenched teeth)
             PULL OVER NOW.

The car comes to a stop.



                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                             64.
CONTINUED: (2)


Trevor gets the goods while he watches himself in the rear
view mirror.

Someone approaches. Trevor zips up, pulls Kristy up out of
his lap. Its a cenobite.

Trevor screams and opens the door of the car to make a
frantic exit. He dive out onto the pavement and looks back.
All is quiet. He's alone a quiet road.

He stands up and into an eerie world of slow motion . Trevor
looks up the road and back to find-

A beautiful vision of Allison walking toward him. Walking
gracefully, she approaches Trevor. Raises her hand to his
face. Trevor smiles, then slowly looks back towards the car.

Inside the car he see's Kristy playing with the puzzle box.
Trevors calls out to her.

                    TREVOR
          Kristy noooo!

And he makes a move toward the car, as the box comes to life.
This stops Trevor in his tracks, and he looks toward Allison.
Who is now PINHEAD.

                    PINHEAD
          There is no reprieve for you. Not even in
          her. She's only a vision I'm afraid.

Tervors looks dumbfounded.

                    PINHEAD (cont'd)

           The truth hurts doesn't it?

END FLASHBACK

INT. PUB - DAY

Trevor raises his head from the bar. The beers are there but
Bret is gone. Trevors stares at himself in the mirror
opposite the bar. He looks like shit. He thinks hard about
the flashback.

Out the door he goes.

                                                            65.



EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT

-Trevor's holding the phone up to his ear agitated beyond
belief. He'd pace if he could. Instead he just fumes.

                       TREVOR
                 (into phone)
             Yes I'm trying to reach one of your
             interns... Allison Dormere...? She works
             in the emergency room there... What do
             you mean...? I just saw her today... Yes
             I'm sure she works there I've been in and
             out of that place five times in the last
             month...! Well good day to you too
             asshole!

-CLOSE UP on Trevor's hand searching through the D's in the
white pages. He slams the book shut in frustration.

-He's on the phone again.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
             No such listing...? Could you at least
             tell me IF she has an unlisted number...?
             What do you mean there are no Dormeres at
             all there have to be...! WELL LOOK AGAIN!
                 (a beat, more timidly)
             H-hello?

Trevor SLAMS the phone down and touches his head again. He
looks at his hand. The blood is gone. But the headache is
back. Its crippling at this point. He's at his wits end. He
reaches into his pocket and finds Pages card. Maybe as a last
resort?

THE PHONE RINGS. IT RINGS AGAIN. Trevor presses his palm
against his eye. Trevor picks up the phone.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
                 (into phone)

DIAL TONE.

                                                             66.



EXT. SAGE'S BUILDING - NIGHT

Trevor is out of breath as he walks up to the last resort.
The entrance to Sage's building. The front door is locked. He
presses a three digit code on the alarm box. RING. RING. The
phone picks up. He's deperate.

                    SAGE'S VOICE
          Hello?

                    TREVOR
          Sage it's me Trevor. You've got to help
          me.

INT. SAGE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Trevor's head hits the pillow on the acupuncture table.

                    TREVOR
          The feeling is very distinct. It's like
          somebody stuck a shard of glass through
          my eye and it's embedded halfway into my
          brain.

Sage nods, patient look on her face.

                    SAGE
          Trevor your body has been completely
          healed. All the nerve endings have
          repaired themselves. If there is any pain
          in your head it's... in your head.

                    TREVOR
          Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.

                    SAGE
          You are physically better. It's your soul
          that still hurts.

Sage grabs a bunch of needles from the table.

                    SAGE (CONT'D)
          My teacher told me once there's a
          puncture point on your body that can lock
          your soul within it, even after you're
          dead. So that when you die you're trapped
          inside your body, watching it corrode for
          all eternity.

                    TREVOR
          Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you,
          forget. You've got to get this fuckin
          pain to stop.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                       SAGE
             It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up
             inside you. You need to free it Trevor.
             You've blocked it from the healing
             process. That's what we need to do now.
             Heal your soul. And to do that I you have
             to give in utterly and without any
             hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I
             mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do
             you trust me implicitly?

                       TREVOR
             I don't even know what's real and what
             isn't how can I trust anyone?

                       SAGE
             You can trust me. Your wife is dead and
             you need to move past that. And the only
             way to move past something completely is
             to go straight through it, not around it.
             Surrender yourself to your wife's death.
             Let it chew you up and spit you back out
             on the other side. It's the only way you
             can become whole again.

Sage looks Trevor dead in the eye.

                       SAGE (CONT'D)
             Are you ready?

                       TREVOR
             I surrender...

Trevor closes his eyes

A MONTAGE

of Sage dimming the lights so that the room is nice and
dark... placing needles into Trevor's body... his
shoulders... his chest... his neck... his legs... his face...

Trevor finally opens his eyes to find...

... he's completely naked on Sage's table! And she's making
love to his body, which is now filled with needles!

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
             Wait... what the hell is this...

                       SAGE
                 (whispering)
             Surrender yourself... surrender
             yourself...

She holds up a small chunk of ice and begins rubbing it on
Trevor's chest. He catches his breath at the cold and begins
to shiver.

INT. CAR - DAY

Trevor wakes up shivering. He is in the passenger seat, head
resting against a baby blanket. A hand touches his...

... Kirsty's.

                    TREVOR
          Kirsty... Kirsty?

                    KIRSTY
          It's okay it was just a nightmare that's
          all.

Trevor looks at Kirsty. She is breathtakingly beautiful.

                    TREVOR
          You're alive...

                    KIRSTY
          Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving
          the rest of the way to gramma's remember?

Trevor looks in the back and for the first time sees an
INFANT GIRL sleeping in a car seat behind him.

                    KIRSTY (CONT'D)
          Trevor I've decided we have got to agree
          on a name before we reach my mother's.
          This poor kid's going to be starting
          preschool as student x if we don't make
          up our minds. So, I've been thinking,
          what about Daisy?

                    TREVOR
              (looking at the baby)
          It's perfect.

                    KIRSTY
          Well that was easy all of a sudden.

Trevor looks back at Kirsty.

                    TREVOR
          Kirsty... I'm glad you're alive.

THE SIREN FROM AN APPROACHING AMBULANCE GETS LOUDER AND
LOUDER, piercing Trevor's ears.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               69.
CONTINUED:

Trevor winces in pain and blocks his ears from the noise.
Kirsty looks at him, puzzled. He can only read her lips:
"Honey what's wrong? Honey?"

INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

Trevor's eye rivet open again. A PARAMEDIC is snapping his
fingers in front of them. Another paramedic is readying a
hypodermic.

                       PARAMEDIC
             Can you hear me? Just nod.

Trevor nods.

                       PARAMEDIC (CONT'D)
             Do you know where you are?

                          TREVOR
             Ambulance.

                       PARAMEDIC
             We're just gonna take some blood here.

The other paramedic sticks a needle in Trevor's arm.

                       PARAMEDIC (CONT'D)
             You know what day it is?

Trevor shakes his head. The paramedic holds up two fingers.

                       PARAMEDIC (CONT'D)
             Okay how many fingers am I holding up?

                          TREVOR
             Two.

                       PARAMEDIC
             Can you follow them?

Paramedic moves his hand left to right. Trevor keeps his eyes
on it.

                       PARAMEDIC (CONT'D)
             Perfect. Hey you remember what happened
             back there?

                       TREVOR
             You mean... when the car went off the
             bridge?

                       PARAMEDIC
                 (laughing)
             Wow you are out of it.

CONTINUED:
                       PARAMEDIC (cont'd)
             No it was nothing that extreme. You were
             riding on the bus and just collapsed onto
             the floor. Out cold. Remember being on a
             bus now?

                       TREVOR
             No... maybe... I don't know.

                       PARAMEDIC
             It's cool. Here we are.

The ambulance comes to a stop.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

A couple of orderlies wheel Trevor into the exact room he's
been coming to this whole time. The orderlies EXIT and who
should ENTER but Dr. Ambrose... and the ANGULAR NURSE who
readied him for the brain surgery at the beginning.

                       DR. AMBROSE
             Hello I'm Dr...

                       TREVOR
             Ambrose. I know.

                       DR. AMBROSE
             Have we met?

                       TREVOR
             I've been in here before.

                       DR. AMBROSE
             Take no offense Trevor. I see many
             patients a day and have an awful memory.

                       TREVOR
             Join the club.

Ambrose holds a penlight up to each of Trevor's eyes and
nods.

                       DR. AMBROSE (CONT'D)
             Right. Trevor you just had a seizure
             brought on by a severe migraine. Things
             could be much worse. In the next few days
             you need to take plenty of aspirin, stay
             out of the sun and make sure you've had
             at least eight glasses of water by the
             time you go to bed at night.

Trevor just stares at Dr. Ambrose.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                            71.
CONTINUED:


                       DR. AMBROSE (CONT'D)
             Why don't you relax for the next couple
             of hours? Barring any relapses you should
             be able to go home after that.

                       TREVOR
             Where's Allison?

Dr. Ambrose looks a little confused.

                       DR. AMBROSE
             Who's Allison?

                       TREVOR
             Allison Dormere. Your intern.

Ambrose looks at the nurse, who shrugs, then back at Trevor.

                       DR. AMBROSE
             Uh we have no intern by that name here
             Mr. Gooding. Listen I'll be back in a few
             hours to check up on you meantime relax
             try not to move around too much.

Ambrose pats Trevor's shoulder congenially and WALKS OUT.

                       NURSE
             There there Trevor. Get some sleep.

Trevor tenses when the nurse smiles.

                       NURSE (CONT'D)
             If you need anything give myself or any
             of the nurses a call okay? We're-

                       TREVOR
             Don't tell me. ëWe're all here for you
             Trevor' right? Go ahead say it! You know
             you want to!

The nurse looks taken aback.

                       NURSE
             What the hell are you talking about...?

Trevor suddenly jumps up yanking electrodes and IV tubes from
his body. The nurse is back to normal and very disconcerted.

                       NURSE (CONT'D)
             Trevor! Mr. Gooding lay back down-

Trevor runs out of the woman mowing the woman down in his
tracks.

                                                             72.



INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAYS - NIGHT

Trevor rushes down the halls of the hospital nearly knocking
down Dr. Ambrose.

                    DR. AMBROSE
          Hey!

Trevor races as fast as his feet can carry him easily losing
Dr. Ambrose.

INT. OTHER WING - NIGHT

Trevor runs down a corridor through another doorway and into
another wing of the hospital entirely. He arrives at the door
to Allison's office and throws it open. It's actually a
janitor's closet.

EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - NIGHT

Dressed in janitorial garb, Trevor bursts open the stairwell
door and comes out on the roof.

An OLD MAN in a johnnie is sitting in one of the chairs not
too far away. An oxygen tube trails from his nose to an
oxygen tank at his feet.

                    OLD MAN
              (wheezing)
          Okay ya caught me.

He brings a cigarette to his lips and takes a long drag.

                    OLD MAN (CONT'D)
          Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff
          left.

                    TREVOR
          I don't work here.

                    OLD MAN
          Music to my ears.

The old man lights a fresh cigarette with the one he's just
finished.

Trevor turns to go back and THERE'S ALLISON standing in the
doorway.

                    ALLISON
          Trevor. I heard you were looking for me.
          Is everything all right?


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            73.
CONTINUED:


                       TREVOR
             Allison! Am I glad to see you!
             (changing his tone) No... everything's
             not right. Not at all.

                          ALLISON
             Come here.

Allison holds him. The old smoker turns and watches with
curiosity.

                       TREVOR
             Allison I think I did some very, very bad
             things. I mean very bad.

                       ALLISON
             Trevor things like this happen to people
             who experience temporary memory loss.
             Everybody does things they regret. You
             just couldn't remember doing these things
             and now you are so it's a shock to the
             system. I'm telling you. You will never
             get better if you keep blaming yourself
             for your wife's death.

                       TREVOR
             Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car
             accident...

The old man calls out to Trevor wheezily.

                          OLD MAN
             Hey buddy!

                       TREVOR
                 (ignoring him)
             ... but I'm starting to think I was... I
             was going to...

                          OLD MAN
             Hey buddy!

Trevor turns to the old man.

                       TREVOR
             What do you want?!

                       OLD MAN
                 (wheezing)
             Who the hell are you talking to?

Trevor turns and Allison is gone. Vanished into thin air.

                                                             74.



INT. BUS - NIGHT

Trevor sits at the front of an empty bus rubbing his head. He
stares at the spot where the creepy old lady knitting the
baby's bootie used to sit. He looks under the seat. There is
nothing there.

The HYDRAULICS HISS as the bus comes to a stop.

                    BUS DRIVER
          This is it mister.

Trevor gets up and hurries off giving the driver a cursory
glance. The driver doesn't look at Trevor as he speaks.

                    BUS DRIVER (CONT'D)
          Have a good night now.

Trevor EXITS the bus.

EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT

Trevor steps out of the bus and faces the ROMAN CATHOLIC
CATHEDRAL. He ascends the steps.

INT. CONFESSIONAL - NIGHT

Trevor sits in the booth across from the tiny screen, behind
which is a VERY TIRED PRIEST who is still in his pajamas.

                    TREVOR
          I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not
          even Catholic. I just had to tell
          somebody. It's like, ever since my wife
          died I don't know what I've actually done
          or what I've imagined. But I do know if
          one tenth of what's happening to me is
          reality... I've done some really awful
          things in my life. Things that I've... I
          guess I've blocked out...

                    PRIEST
          What things do you think you've done?

                    TREVOR
          Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little
          time. For starters I was responsible for
          the death my wife who by the way was
          carrying my unborn child. That was so I
          could collect her eight million dollar
          estate. I think I killed several women I
          was having mindless sex with behind her
          back.

CONTINUED:
                       TREVOR (cont'd)
             But I did those murders just for the hell
             of it. Finally... I think I made some
             kind of deal with the devil and now he's
             come to collect my soul. Only he's
             decided to mess with my head first. How
             many Hail Marys do you recommend for that
             one father?

                       PRIEST
             Trevor I'm sure you killed no one. You
             are very distraught over your wife's
             death and rightfully so. You did the
             right thing by confessing to me here
             tonight. And you should keep praying for
             the wisdom that will set your soul at
             ease. That being said, you are still in a
             highly emotional state right now. It
             might do you some good to get some
             professional help. Confess to them the
             way you confessed to me. In time you'll
             probably find that the real killer has
             already been caught. Or better yet...
             that these murders never happened at all.

                       TREVOR
             But I saw these women. I saw their
             mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I
             just know it happened I can feel it...

                       PRIEST
             All you've got is the here and the now
             Trevor. That's all anyone really has.
             Maybe this will make things easier to
             understand. A man goes to sleep every
             night and has recurring dream that he's a
             butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if
             he might actually be a butterfly who
             dreams he's a man. And at the end of the
             day does it even matter? All these events
             you're describing. How can you be sure
             any of them really happened?

                       TREVOR
             But that's what I need. To be sure... to
             be absolutely sure...

                       PRIEST
             Shh. It's okay son. There is but one
             truth. One thing you can be absolutely
             sure of. And that thing is this:

The priest moves closer to the screen.

                    PRIEST (CONT'D)
          WE'RE ALL HERE FOR YOU TREVOR.

The Priest begins to chuckle ominously.

Resisting the urge to scream Trevor bolts out of the
confessional...

INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

Trevor rushes out of the confessional. THE CATHEDRAL BELL
begins to CLANG. Eardrums getting battered by the RINGING
Trevor blocks his ears and rushes toward the exit-

-coming face to face with a gargoyle blocking his path.
PINHEAD. Though he speaks softly his voice is heard easily
over the bell.

                    PINHEAD
          Still in the dark I see?

                    TREVOR
          Who are you?

                    PINHEAD
          Poor Trevor.

                    TREVOR
          This game is over do you hear me?

                    PINHEAD
          I hear everything. And soon you will know
          everything. More than you ever wanted I
          can guarantee that. But I want you to
          think for a minute first. Think about all
          you've seen. All the clues you've been
          given.

Pinhead opens his cloak revealing the darkness within. To
Trevor's shock his sucked right into this void inside
Pinhead.

INT. CUBIC ROUTE ACTUARIAL RESEARCH, BULLPEN - NIGHT

Trevor is thrust into the interior of his office building.
Everyone's gone for the day. The only light is coming in from
streetlights outside. Trevor races past the cubicles running
out into a hallway.

He looks down one end then the other... where he sees an
office light is on. He cautiously approaches the office.

He looks inside.

                                                             77.



INT. GWEN'S OFFICE - DAY

Gwen's hacked up body is strewn about the office. Her arms
are atop the filing cabinet. Legs under her desk. Ass on the
copier.

Trevor hears someone coming. He looks down the hall to see A
FLASHLIGHT BEAM TURN THE CORNER, blinding him. It's bearer
begins running toward Trevor.

Trevor bolts the other direction heading for the exit. He
pushes the door open and slams it behind him only he's not
still outside yet...

INT. TAWNY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tawny lies on the bed, dead, tongue sticking out of her neck,
ribcage violated.

Trevor hears someone coming toward the bedroom can see the
flashlight beam jittering as its bearer approaches.

Trevor rushes toward the window, opens it and leaps out onto
the fire escape.

EXT. APT. BUILDING - NIGHT

Trevor's about to climb down the fire escape when he is
bathed in the flashlight's beam from inside. Trevor looks
down and sees a garbage dumpster full of trash bags below. He
jumps.

Trevor sails down three stories and lands in the dumpster. He
climbs out and runs to the street as fast as he can. He races
down the sidewalk trying to get his bearings at the same
time.

Hearing footsteps from behind Trevor turns to see:

The Stranger in the Window not half a block behind Trevor,
keeping Trevor's pace. Then... Trevor stops. And turns.

The Stranger stops as well. This has never happened before.
Trevor shouts down the empty street.

                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
          WHO ARE YOU!

His voice echoes off the darkened buildings.

The Stranger stands there. Trevor begins walking toward him,
blood in his eyes. The Stranger backs away.

CONTINUED:


Trevor bolts into a run and the Stranger takes off running
the other way.

The stranger darts into an alley.

INT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Trevor runs into the alley, seeing no signs of the stranger.
The end of the alley is pitch black.

                       TREVOR
             WHERE'S MY WIFE?!

Trevor hears something at the end of the alley. He grabs a
broken bottle out of a garbage can and heads toward the
darkness. Trevor's teeth are bared now.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
             WHERE'S MY WIFE!?

Something GLISTENS in the dark just before the razor sharp
edge of a switchblade touches his left jugular. Trevor
freezes. OUT OF THE SHADOWS comes... BRET.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
             Bret... what the fuck...?

                       BRET
             Tonight was supposed to be the night,
             Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you
             went through five dart games and didn't
             even joke about it.

                       TREVOR
             Bret. What the hell is going on?

                       BRET
             We were gonna be millionaires you said.
             Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never
             even met her. No connection. Then you
             went and had that fucking car accident.

                       TREVOR
             Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.

                       BRET
             I followed her Trevor. I got to know her
             life. And what a boring one it was. Six
             a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop,
             noon bookstore, one soap operas, four
             o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to
             come home. And wait and wait and wait.
             Nine o'clock get ready for bed.

CONTINUED:
                       BRET (cont'd)
             Ten o'clock fall asleep in front of the
             TV. She did that every day I followed
             her. Every single day. While you were out
             fucking your concubines. Every day I felt
             more and more bad for her, man. And hated
             you more and more.

Trevor is absolutely speechless.

                       BRET (CONT'D)
             Then I find out you're having nooners
             with my GWEN. That was all I could take.
             I didn't want to kill your wife anymore.
             I wanted to kill you. Even before that
             little accident I decided to do it on the
             day we'd set aside for her.

Bret presses the blade against Trevor's neck a little harder,
drawing a rivulet of blood.

                       BRET (CONT'D)
             But now that ain't gonna happen either. I
             fell in love with Kirsty Trevor. The day
             she died it was like my soul had been
             ripped from my body. Not just because I
             lost someone I loved. It's because the
             child inside her... was mine.

Bret then puts the knife to his neck.

                       TREVOR
             No!

Bret drags the knife across his own jugulars slicing them
open. Blood pours out of his smiling mouth. Then something
really weird happens. Cuts begin to open up all over Bret's
face and his hands. Blood pouring to the ground in buckets.

Bret lifelessly falls into the pool of blood... Before he can
process what's just happened, Trevor hears a NOISE behind him
and turns to see... several of those slithering sewer
monsters coming toward him, surrounding him.

And behind them, SEVERAL SILHOUETTED FIGURES walking slowly
toward him. We don't need three guesses to figure out who
they are... CENOBITES.

Panicking Trevor reaches down and grabs the knife out of
Bret's hand and readies himself for the inevitable attack
when-

-the BLINDING LIGHT FROM A POLICE car illuminates the alley.
First Trevor notices the sewer monsters are gone.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

Then the figures we thought were Cenobites are actually LANGE
and several police officers. Lange looks disappointed.

                    LANGE
          Okay Trevor. Put the knife down.

Trevor does so. TWO COPS rush up to Trevor and one swings his
baton down just over Trevor's eye- CRACK!

LIGHTS OUT.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

Trevor's nose has been bleeding. His eye is black and blue
his lip cut. Trevor looks out the window. The streets are
deserted, foreign.

Trevor looks at the rear view mirror. The cop staring back at
him averts his gaze. Trevor thinks he sees something crawl
into the cop's eye.

Lange sits next to the cop, staring back at Trevor. He takes
out his antihistamine and sprays some up his nose.

INT. POLICE STATION LOBBY - NIGHT

The doors burst open and the two cops, Lange escorts Trevor
IN.

The lobby is entirely deserted. Trevor looks around. There
are cups of coffee sitting on desks, jackets thrown over
backs of chairs. Signs of a recently bustling workplace that
has vacated.

INT. CHECK-IN - NIGHT

The cops hustle Trevor up to a counter, finger print him, sit
him in a chair. One of them sits at a computer terminal.
Despite being indoors both cops keep their sunglasses on.

                       COP#1
          Full name?

                    TREVOR

                                                   smaSH CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The cops hurry Trevor down a dank corridor toward a line up
room. Trevor sneaks a peek inside one of the rooms.

INSIDE THE DOORWAY: TWO DETECTIVES have some HAPLESS SOUL
strapped to some odd looking electrical contraption.

                       HAPLESS SOUL
             I told you I don't know!

                       DETECTIVE#1
             Wrong answer!

Detective#1 hits a button and a shock races through the
Hapless Soul's body. Just then the other detective notices
Trevor looking in and SLAMS the door shut.

The trio comes to the line up room.

INT. LINE UP ANTEROOM - NIGHT

Trevor is shoved into the cramped booth-like room with four
other strange looking MEN who all stare at him. Silence for a
moment then:

A LOUD BUZZ is heard and the door on the other side of room
opens.

                       COP#1
             Single file.

Trevor follows the other men. The MAN just ahead of Trevor
turns to him.

                       MAN
             We're all here for you Trevor.

                       COP#1
             NO TALKING!

INT. LINE UP ROOM - NIGHT

Trevor walks IN with the rest of the gentlemen. Hugging the
nearest wall they go up a small set of stairs onto a stage.
Trevor hears Lange's VOICE overhead.

                       LANGE'S VOICE
             Stop and face the mirror!

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                82.
CONTINUED:


The five men do as they're told, facing a large two-way
mirror on the opposite wall. An awkward moment.

                          LANGE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
             Thank you!

The door to the room opens again and Trevor turns, leading
the other men back through the anteroom.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The cops hustle Trevor out into the hallway. The next door
down opens and out come two more detectives and... TAWNY'S
BOYFRIEND, the brute, looking fit to be tied. He sees Trevor
and fills with rage.

                       BRUTE
             I hope they fry your ass mutherfucker!

He lunges at Trevor. It takes the detectives he's with and
two more cops to keep him from pummeling Trevor. As Trevor's
lead away the brute begins to sob uncontrollably.

                       BRUTE (CONT'D)
                 (to Trevor)
             YOU'RE GONNA BURN IN HELL!!

                       COP#1
             Got quite a fan club don't you, hotshot?

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Trevor sits at a tape recorder. Lange sits across from him.

                       TREVOR
             For the last time. I honestly don't know
             how any of them died...

Lange stands, squirting antihistamine in his nose. He nods at
Trevor and WALKS OUT. No sooner has the door closed when it
opens again and Givens walks IN. Givens gets right in
Trevor's face.

                       GIVENS
             Now I want you to tell me what you
             remember happening- in your own words-
             exactly the way you told Detective Lange.
             But this time I want you to make one
             small adjustment.

                       TREVOR
             What's that?


                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                83.
CONTINUED:


Givens whirls around revealing Lange's face on the back of
his head!

                       LANGE
             DON'T FUCKING LIE TO ME!

Trevor thinks a moment. He is absolutely numb. He smiles a
little insanely.

                       TREVOR
             I did it. I killed them all. I confess.

INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY - NIGHT

Still handcuffed Trevor is escorted toward the detention area
by the cops in the sunglasses. He's silently praying he'll
wake up from this one somehow. No such luck. Trevor and the
cops round a corner and there's Lange running up to them.

                       LANGE
                 (to the cops)
             Quick detour through the morgue boys.

Lange leads them to a set of elevators.

                          TREVOR
             Morgue...?

                       LANGE
             That's right Trevor. The timing was
             impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight
             months two weeks and three days but we
             finally found the body. Just need you to
             ID it for us.

                       TREVOR
             Where was it?

                       LANGE (CONT'D)
             That's the weird part. It just magically
             turned up in the river less than thirty
             yards from where the car had landed. Like
             somebody put it there while we weren't
             looking.

The elevator doors open and they get in.

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

It's a long ride down. Nobody speaks.

Trevor looks at the cops in the sunglasses. One of them takes
his pair off. His eye sockets are empty. We can see brain.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                84.
CONTINUED:

The cop cleans his shades then his mouth smiles at Trevor
before he puts the sunglasses back on.

Finally the doors open. Lange unlocks Trevor's handcuffs and
the cops push him out the door into a dark corridor.

INT. DARK CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Trevor looks back to see Lange and the cops staring back at
him.

                       LANGE
             Just keep walking Trevor. You can't miss
             it.

One of the cops waves bye-bye to him. And with that the
elevator doors shut.

Trevor turns around and faces the long corridor. He begins
his hike towards its end where an ominous set of double doors
awaits.

He arrives at them and pushes them open.

INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

As soon as the doors open fluorescent lights flicker overhead
illuminating two walls of metal drawers and between them: a
large slab of marble upon which rests a human form covered
with a sheet. Trevor ENTERS.

He makes his way toward the body and stares at it.

A low WHEEZING noise coming from a dark corner just beyond
the slab distracts him. Trevor looks and freezes when he
sees:

THE GOAT laying on the floor in a pool of blood. It's still
breathing. One of the goat's slatted eyes is staring at
Trevor as if begging for mercy. A STRANGE RIPPING NOISE is
heard. The goat MEWLS in pain then its eye rolls up. Dead.

The animal's body begins to quiver as a tiny wound on its
back widens spitting out streams of blood.

Trevor begins to back away as the wound stretches open,
giving birth to a rising form...

PINHEAD. He rises completely from the goat, stepping out of
the wound. He is red with blood for a second. Then his skin
and robe absorb the blood like a sponge. Pinhead approaches
Trevor blocking him from the body on the slab.

                       TREVOR
             I don't know who you are or what you
             want. I just want to know what's under
             that sheet...

                       PINHEAD
             Use your mind for something other than
             numbers dear Trevor. Think about people
             for a change. People other than yourself.
             Like the women you slept with behind your
             wife's back. You were always so confident
             you had covered your tracks. Always
             confident your wife actually believed
             your fervent denials? Part of you must
             have known she would find out.

          We were about to come for Kirsty. When we
          were offered a deal. We don't usually
          consider bargains but this one was too
          good to pass up. A tribute to the
          resourcefulness of a parent hellbent on
          protecting its spawn. The deal we were
          offered was this: three more souls in
          exchange for the life of the unborn child
          inside Kirsty. The three souls had
          already been picked out. Needless to say
          we were very impressed.

The lights dim. Drawers behind Pinhead begin to open. We see
Gwen's body, Tawny's, Sage's, Bonnie's.

                    PINHEAD (CONT'D)
          Two of your favorite companions, most
          supple and delicious as you already know.
          And the man you had at one time conspired
          to kill Kirsty with. Until you found out
          she was with child.

                                                smASH CUT TO:

QUICK IMAGES of Gwen, Tawny, and Bret being rent to pieces by
the Cenobites, SCREAMING in vain.

INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

                    PINHEAD (CONT'D)
          They were all real screamers too. We had
          a blast. And there was one more. You've
          seen many things you wished you hadn't.
          Many nightmares from which you never
          awoke. They were all clues in our little
          puzzle. Can you guess now Trevor? Can you
          guess the fifth soul chosen for us to
          torment in this little agreement?

The lights flicker overhead, reddening with each strobe.
Hundreds of those little sewer monsters come slithering out
of the cracks in the walls, racing toward Trevor. He doesn't
care.

                    TREVOR
          WHAT'S UNDER THE SHEET?




                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              88.

                       PINHEAD
                 (smiling)
             Welcome to the worst nightmare of them
             all, Trevor. Reality.

Pinhead grabs the sheet and whips it back.

Trevor's jaw drops in disbelief.

IT'S TREVOR'S BODY. It is blue, bloated and mutilated. The
corpse's skull has a massive crack in it.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
             No... no...

INT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY

Kirsty sits across from Lange, who slides the cube across the
desk towards her.

                       LANGE
             Open this and your problem will disappear
             forever. And no one will ever suspect
             you.

INT. CAR - DAY

Kirsty drives. Trevor sits in the passenger seat, in the same
position we saw him in during his last flashback. Only now it
is clear the reason his head is resting on the baby blanket
is to keep his brains from spilling out his split open skull.
ON KIRSTY'S HAND holding his. It is now covered with blood.

                       KIRSTY
             Shhh it's okay.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

The car goes off the bridge landing in the water. Kirsty's
head breaks the surface. She watches the car sink into the
river.

                                                         baCK TO:

INT. MORGUE

Trevor stares at his own dead body in utter disbelief. The
sewer monsters begin crawling up his legs. Pinhead smiles.

                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
             NOOO!!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                              89.
CONTINUED:


The scream ECHOES over Trevor's dead self, which seems so
tranquil in contrast. HOLD on the corpse. After a beat the
bells stop, as does the rumbling and the cracking. The lights
brighten. Serenity. Then:

                       KIRSTY'S VOICE
             Yes. Yes that's him.

REVERSE ANGLE on Kirsty looking down at the corpse wiping her
eyes. She looks over to the other side of the body where
Trevor and Pinhead had been standing. Where now DETECTIVE
LANGE and the coroner DR. AMBROSE had been standing.

The two gentlemen look at each other.

                       LANGE
             Well I guess that's it then. Thank you
             Mrs. Gooding I realize that must have
             been tough.

Lange escorts Kirsty to the door. They EXIT but not before
Kirsty gives her late husband a parting glance. Ambrose
covers Trevor's body and looks OFF CAMERA.

                       DR. AMBROSE
             Alrighty. Let's get started folks.

REVERSE on two other DOCTORS who are busying themselves
collecting instrument. ALLISON and SAGE. They walk over to
Trevor's body and get to work. Sage sticks a needle in
Trevor's arm.

                       SAGE
             Collecting 40ccs of serum...

                       AMBROSE
             Examining cranial fracture...

Allison at his side, Ambrose checks the wound on Trevor's
head, pauses to look inside Trevor's eyes.

TREVOR'S POV: Ambrose closing the eyelid again.

                       AMBROSE (CONT'D)
             Checking oral cavity for blockage...

Ambrose opens Trevor's mouth.

                       AMBROSE (CONT'D)
             And we have a winner...

Ambrose pulls a long black dead lamprey out of Trevor's
mouth. Looks at the slippery creature for a moment.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                             90.

                    ALLISON
          Looks like an eel of some kind.

                    AMBROSE
          Guess it was murder after all.

                    SAGE
          Yeah all we need is the eel's motive.

Allison holds out a large freezer bag, into which Ambrose
dumps the dead lamprey.

                    ALLISON
          I still don't get it. He's been missing
          for almost eight months. But this body
          hasn't been dead more than twenty four
          hours.

                    DR. AMBROSE
          Makes you wonder what he was up to
          between the time he disappeared and when
          he died.

Allison walks right up to the corpse's face.

                    ALLISON
          Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?

                    DR. AMBROSE
              (shivering)
          Allison what on earth possesses you to
          converse with cadavers?

                     SAGE
              (looking at Trevor's corpse)
          It's simple, Dr. Ambrose. What if there
          is no afterlife? What happens when we
          die? Do we just stay stuck inside your
          bodies for eternity watching ourselves
          decompose?

                    AMBROSE
          I'm not following this...

                    ALLISON
          Well if that's the case... wouldn't you
          want someone to talk to you like a normal
          human being one last time?

                    AMBROSE
          You two are creeping me out. And I'm a
          coroner.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

Allison fixes a stray lock of hair on Trevor's forehead.

QUICK CUTS: Allison slipping a tag on Trevor's toe; sliding
Trevor's body into the morgue drawer; her hand turning the
lock on the drawer.

                    ALLISON (O.S.)
          Adios amigo.

INT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY

Lange sits across from Kirsty, who signs some paperwork on
Lange's desk.

                    KIRSTY
          I would have come in sooner but I had an
          important errand to run last night. Out
          of town. Figures you'd find his body the
          minute I decide to go off somewhere.

                    LANGE
          Well you made it down here that's the
          important part. Thank you for your
          patience Mrs. Gooding.

She nods teary eyed. She slides the paperwork across his desk
and gets up to leave.

                    LANGE (CONT'D)
          One last thing... When they found him he
          was holding something. Not to get too
          graphic but they had to wrench it from
          his hand.

Lange reaches under his desk then stands revealing:

THE CUBE inside a ziploc bag. Lange and Kirsty exchange a
knowing glance.

                    LANGE (CONT'D)
          Figured you might want it.

                    KIRSTY
          Of course. That was my... last
          anniversary present to him.

                    LANGE
          A token to remember him by now. Goodbye
          Mrs. Gooding.

She takes the cube.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                92.
CONTINUED:


                       KIRSTY
             Thank you detective.

Lange takes out his nasal sprayer as she walks OUT. She
closes the door behind her and Lange looks up at the closed
door. He sticks the sprayer up his nose.

INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY - DAY

Kirsty walks toward the exit. On her way she passes a trash
can. She discretely tosses the cube into it and rubs her
hands together.

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

The birds are chirping. The sun is shining. Kirsty Gooding
walks out the door and takes a breath of fresh air. She skips
down the steps of the police station toward the street. She
stops in the middle of the sidewalk looking both ways.

A SHADOW COMES up behind her. It's the STRANGER Trevor had
seen out his window. He grabs her shoulder startling Kirsty.
She turns to see LARRY ELLIS, shit-eating grin on his face.
He's holding an eight month old BABY. The one he was drawing.

                       LARRY
             Looking for someone, Kirsty?

                       KIRSTY
                 (taking the baby)
             You bet I was.

Kirsty plants a multitude of smothering kisses on the
laughing child as A NANNY comes up behind Larry pushing a
stroller. Kirsty gently places the baby in it.

                       KIRSTY (CONT'D)
                 (to Nanny)
             Okay we're on our way. Remember her-

                       NANNY
             Lactose intolerance. I've stocked the
             fridge with Lactaid.

                       KIRSTY
             See you in a couple of weeks. You've got
             my cell number right?

The Nanny pushes the stroller away, nodding, waving good-bye.
Larry smiles as he watches the baby go.




                                                        (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                        LARRY
             Daisy is getting so big.
                 (beat)
             I still can't believe HE was her father.

Kirsty smiles to herself.

                       KIRSTY
             Counselor can we not mention HIM anymore.
             Can we just start spending HIS money
             instead.

They walk slowly toward the curb.

                       LARRY
             I've always wanted to go to Madagascar.

                       KIRSTY
             You mean the place with bats?

                       LARRY
             They're called flying lemurs.

                       KIRSTY
             Yeah that sounds like a real blast...

They put their arms around each other.

                       KIRSTY (cont'd)
             I've been thinking about it. This has to
             have been the best eight months of my
             life.

Larry sees a cab and rushes out to hail it.

                       LARRY (CONT'D)
             TAXI!

Something out the corner of her eye scares Kirsty. She turns
to see Lange standing there.

                       LANGE
             You forgot something.

Lange holds up the cube she tossed out. Kirsty's expression
falls. But... how...?

                       KIRSTY
             Oh. Thank you.

Kirsty takes the cube.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                             94.
CONTINUED: (2)


                    LANGE (CONT'D)
          No Mrs. Gooding.

Lange turns and Kirsty's shock there's Givens' face... on the
back of Lange's head!

                       GIVENS
          Thank YOU.

Givens smiles at her then walks away. She slowly walks toward
the cab where Larry has opened the door for her.

                    LARRY
          After you my dear.

INT. CAB - DAY

Kirsty slides into the cab looking at the cube in despair.
Larry slides in after her.

                    LARRY
              (to the cabbie)
          Airport please.

He grabs Kirsty's knee. She just stares at the cube.

                       LARRY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
          What's up?

Larry looks down at the cube. It has magically risen from her
palms and begun to rearrange itself in that way we've come to
know and love so well.

The cabbie, looking back at the sight, slowly slides the
window between the driver and passenger compartments shut.

                    KIRSTY
          Time, Larry. Time's up.

EXT. CAB - DAY

As the cab drives off into traffic we see LIGHT FLICKER from
within it. The cab passes a cathedral. Its BELL BEGINS TO
TOLL.

          EXT. DESERT HILLS - DAY

          Open on a GEIGER COUNTER scanning over a rocky terrain.
          A SAND STORM blows over the landscape. We are lost somewhere
          in the middle of the New Mexico desert.
          According to the instrument, the area contains high levels of
          radiation...
          THREE MEN WEARING FULL ANTI-RADIATION SUITS have left their
          jeep behind to collect samples of contaminated rocks.
          Not at all worried or bothered by the dust storm or high
          winds, they walk towards the hills.
          The man holding the counter stops in his tracks -

                         MAN 1
          (loudly through the

                         STORM)

          ALRIGHT, GUESS.

                         MAN 2

          I'D SAY 43.9?

                         MAN 1

          IT'S OVER 124.5!

                         MAN 2

          IT'S GOT TO BE OFF.

                         (WALKING AWAY)

          THAT'S THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE

          FALLOUT IN CHERNOBYL...

                         - MAN 3
          (following his colleague)

          YEAH. PROBABLY NEEDS SOME

          ADJUSTMENT.

                         MAN 2

          ...CAN'T TRUST THE DIGITAL ONES...

                         MAN 1

                         (STANDING STILL)
          No...It's something else... It's
          like the radioactivity is moving
          around us.
          The numbers on the dial continue to fluctuate. Where is this
          intensity coming from?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         1 CONTINUED: 1
          He turns around, seeing nothing but sand and rock through his
          mask.
          Suddenly, for no apparent reason, THE GEIGER COUNTER GETS

          LOUDER AS THE NUMBERS SKYROCKET.
          In confusion, he taps on the instrument attempting to
          stabilize it, but the radioactivity continues to climb...
          He looks up to the horizon obscured by the sand storm - still
          nothing in sight.
          He sighs. His colleague is probably right, the Geiger counter
          simply needs an adjustment...
          He turns it off when A MAN COVERED WITH BLOOD, HALF NAKED,
          comes out of nowhere and jumps at his face-

                         MAN

          HELP ME... HELP ME, PLEASE HELP ME!
          Scared to death, the scientist pushes him away and backs off.
          The man covered by blood falls on the ground and starts
          crying, begging for help. The scientist doesn't have time to

                         REACT-

          THE RUSTY POINT OF A PICKAXE COMES THROUGH THE BACK OF HIS

          MASK AND OUT OF HIS FOREHEAD!
          Terrified, the man covered with blood watches the scientist's
          dead body-fall to the ground revealing, for a quick second, A

          DARK SHAPE FLASHING IN THE SUN.

                         CUT TO:
          In the distance, the other scientists continue their work,
          oblivious to the attack. Kneeling behind a rock, they make a

                         DISCOVERY-

                         MAN 2

          With his hand, one of the scientists removes the dust around
          some SKELETAL REMAINS.

          to tell whether they are human or animal.

          THE PICKAXE SWINGS THROUGH HIS BACK.

          IMPALED LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT, HIS BODY IS SWEPT INTO THE AIR

          ONLY TO BE SLAMMED AGAINST THE ROCKS...
          Blood splatters on the third man, who steps back suffocating
          with fear behind his mask.
          The shadowy figure continues the assault on Man 2, finishing
          him off. Powerless to stop'the massacre, the last scientist
          runs away in a panic.
          At the top of the hill, he appears, out of breath. He doesn't
          have time to climb the rocks as he is pulled down, screaming
          in his mask.

          While preparing dinner, the perfect housewife presents the
          kitchen of tomorrow by praising all the benefits of nuclear
          energy.
          She is joined by her husband, their children, and their dog.
          The entire family sits at the table with big smiles.
          The frame freezes on this naive image of prosperity and well
          being. A slogan appears:

          "NUCLEAR ENERGY, TRY IT...WE DID!"
          CLASSIFIED STOCK FOOTAGE replaces the commercial-
          These new images are of nuclear tests performed by the US
          Army in the New Mexico desert during the same period-

          SUPER: NEW MEXICO - TODAY
          The sharp outline of the hills appears with the first morning
          light.
          The sun begins to rise revealing-
          A long deserted horizon stretching out endlessly.
          Nothing lives in this and wilderness.

          4 EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 4

          A road curves through the desert terrain.
          On the side of the road, at the bottom of a hill, a gas
          station has survived years of wind and dust.
          Around the main building, a tool shed, three gas pumps, a
          dilapidated well, a water tower, and gutted carcasses of cars
          from the 1950's accentuate the desolate feeling which
          prevails in this place.
          A sign reads "LAST STOP FOR 200 MILES".
          A few tumbleweeds roll across the road.

          KRIIINK KRONK - the noise becomes regular.
          In the darkness we discover a room hardly furnished. The
          withered and yellowed wallpaper flaps slowly in the draft.
          On the dresser, dozens of empty liquor bottles.
          KRIIINK KRONK - On the bed, THE OLD GAS STATION ATTENDANT
          lays with his back to the window.
          KRIIINK KRONK - The noise outside continues steadily without
          disturbing his sleep.
          KRIIINK KRONK - Suddenly, the old man wakes up short of
          breath and looks around trying to locate the noise.
          KRIIINK KRONK - He looks through the shutters, then quickly
          puts on the top of his gas station overalls. He grabs a
          SHOTGUN, loading it swiftly.

          KRIIINK KRONK - The metal grinding noise increases as we move
          towards the gas station door.
          The door opens and the old man walks out holding his gun.
          Nobody. Silence has returned. The metal grinding is gone.
          The lever from the water well still moves. IT'S JUST BEEN

          USED!
          Hidden behind the house someone or something observes the old
          station attendant walking slowly to the well.
          DRIP... DRIP... DRIP...- water falls on the palm of his hand.
          Worried, the old man scans the surroundings.

          HE IS NOT ALONE.

          Behind the gas station, someone observes the old man coming
          back to the house.
          AN EXPENSIVE LEATHER BAG was placed in front of his door
          during his absence.
          The old man looks-around terrified.
          Diligently, he enters the house leaving the bag on the
          ground.
          On second thought, the door reopens and the bag is dragged
          inside.

          The shutters are all closed leaving the station in darkness.
          The old man throws the leather bag on the dining table and
          sets down the shotgun.
          He takes a cigar from an ashtray and lights it. He grabs a
          whisky bottle.

          After a solid gulp, he turns on a bare light-bulb hanging
          over the table, and stares at the bag in silence. One more
          swig for courage, and the old man empties the bag on the

                         TABLE-
          Jewels, a Swiss watch, a DV Cam, glasses, several cell
          phones, a pager, loose cash, credit cards, a wallet...

          .A FEW GOLD TEETH, AND AN EAR ON WHICH HANG GOLD EARRINGS.
          He grabs the wallet and pulls out a photo already sticking
          out.
          On the bent picture, we see a young couple kissing. The young
          woman wears the same earrings found on the severed ear...
          The old man heaves a sigh before putting the wad of cash in
          his pocket. Outside, a voice is heard.

          MAN (O.S.)

          SOMEONE THERE?!
          The voice is followed by a car horn.
          The old man quickly gathers the objects from the table
          returning them to the bag.

          A 1988 AIRSTREAM TRAILER HOME hitched to A CHEVROLET SUV is
          parked in front of the gas station.
          BIG BOB CARTER, an imposing man in his late fifties, stands
          outside the vehicle still honking the horn.
          The trailer home and SUV with the AMERICAN FLAG waving on the
          side, completes the image - Big Bob is an obvious cliche of
          the middle class Republican father with a touch of John

          tries to fix the broken A/C.
          His glasses and white oxford shirt drenched in sweat, Doug is
          totally out of his element. This is a guy who has never been
          out of the city.

          grill to access the mechanism.

          13 INT. SUV - DAY 13

          While they are talking outside, a DEFORMED HAND slides into
          the back window of the SUV.

          A HAND WITH ONLY THREE STRANGELY PROPORTIONED FINGERS.
          It moves slowly, snatching BOBBY'S HOODED SWEATER from the
          back seat.

          SMALL VOICE (O.S.)

                         (WHISPERING)
          .Annnnaaaaau...
          Under the car the visitor's feet walk way. They are bare,
          dirty and covered with dust.

          14 INT. / EXT. OUTHOUSE - DAY 14

          Rays of light pass through the wooden planks.
          The outhouse is so dirty that Bobby is forced to hold his
          breath...
          An EYE peeks between the wooden planks!

                         BOBBY JUMPS-

                         BOBBY
          What the hell Brenda!
          The eye goes away...
          He re-zips looking outside. Nobody.
          When he exits, Brenda appears on the other side.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Freak.
          She looks at him slightly confused...

          What?

          15 EXT. GAS STATION/ROAD - DAY 15

          Doug sits on the porch giving the baby her bottle.
          The old gas station attendant checks the oil and the water.
          ,Ethel joins him, holding a road map.

          OLD GAS ATTENDANT
          You're at least six or seven hours
          away'from there.
          Ethel gives her husband a dirty look.

                         ETHEL
          I told you we should have gone
          through Santa Fe. You never listen
          to me.

          OLD GAS ATTENDANT
          This is the only southbound road
          that goes to 1-88. From there you
          can take the 231 West to
          California. But you'll never make
          it before sundown...

          As the old man closes the hood, a familiar sound returns-

          KRIIINK KRONK - KRIIINK KRONK - KRIIINK KRONK
          He leans over and catches Bobby and Brenda in the distance,
          playing with the well. Brenda is about to drink from her
          hands.

          OLD GAS ATTENDANT
          (shouting to them)

          DON'T DRINK THAT WATER, MISS. IT

          AIN'T NO GOOD.

          There is another room behind the counter, and the beaded
          curtain which separates the two rooms is still moving.

          Beauty? Come on, sweetie...
          No answer.
          Cautiously, Lynn moves through the store to the beaded
          curtains. Above the cash register, an old sepia photograph of
          a miner stares at her.

                         LYNN (CONT'D)
          Beauty?
          Lynn goes into the other room.
          In the darkness, among the old empty bottles, she finds
          Beauty standing with her front legs on a window sill and
          barking to the backyard.
          Lynn looks outside- Nobody. Only the desert and hills.
          Inside the room, THE HALF OPEN EXPENSIVE LEATHER BAG laying
          alone on the table awakens her curiosity.
          As she goes to inspect it, she hears the SUV starting and
          Doug calling out-

          DOUG (O.S.)
          Honey!? We're leaving...
          Lynn grabs the dog by the collar.

          The old man lets her pass with the dog, watching her WITH
          SUSPICION- Has she seen the contents of the bag?

          17 EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 17

          Through the gas station window, we see Lynn leaving with the
          dog.
          Outside, next to the rusty abandoned cars, THE PIGLET HAS
          DISAPPEARED. Only the rope remains.

          A MURMUR IS HEARD AS A SHADOW PASSES SLYLY ON THE FLOOR.

          Lynn puts the dog in the trailer where Doug and Bobby are.
          She enters the SUV. Behind the wheel, Big Bob turns around
          one last time before driving off-

          You know, it's not on the map, but
          if you take a right at the road a
          couple miles from here, it'll lead
          you through the hills. Probably
          save you three or four hours.

          The trailer drives off in the distance leaving the attendant
          in a cloud of dust.

          The binoculars pan across the deserted terrain before
          stopping on the Carter vehicle, a tiny dot at the end of the
          road. The car and trailer approach.
          Off screen, we hear ANIMALISTIC BREATHING behind the
          binoculars.
          The SUV turns off the main road onto a dirt trail. We see
          Brenda lifting the gate and allowing the vehicles to access
          the path, unaware of the danger lurking about.
          Brenda gets back in the SUV. It pulls the trailer on the dirt
          road towards the hills.

          We see the scenery through the window blinds.
          On a wall, photographs of other Carter vacations are
          reminders of the good times spent in the trailer home.
          The thermometer reads above 100 degrees. Sweating, Doug hangs
          on while the camper bounces over the rough road.
          Bobby works on the A/C. He has removed the face plate and
          tries to fix the motor with the screwdriver.

          Still driving, Big Bob turns to his daughters-

                         (SLYLY)

          24 EXT. HILL ROAD - DAY 24

          The lizard has almost crossed the road when-
          SHLING!- RAZOR SHARP METAL SPIRES come out of the ground
          slicing the lizard in two.
          A trap has been set: a long chain of retractable spikes have
          emerged across the road.
          A few seconds later, the SW drives over them at full speed.

          INSTANTLY, THE TIRES EXPLODE.
          Big Bob loses control of the vehicle.
          The car rolls on the rims causing the trailer to almost flip
          over.
          Inside, Doug loses his grip and is thrown against the side of
          the trailer.
          On the road, the spikes retract, disappearing into the
          ground.

          THE SW AND THE TRAILER HOME ZIGZAG ON THE DIRT ROAD BEFORE

          CRASHING AGAINST SOME ROCKS.
          Silence.
          The chain of spikes slithers away in the dust like a snake.

          NO TRACE REMAINS OF WHAT CAUSED THE ACCIDENT.
          The dead lizard, sliced neatly in half, bakes in the hot sun.

          25 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 25

          The dust slowly settles revealing the broken down vehicles.
          Lynn jumps out of the car and runs to the trailer.

                         LYNN
          Doug? Bobby? Are you alright?
          Bobby opens the door releasing the barking dogs.

                         BOBBY
          Don't worry, we're fine.

          I think so... Just a little shaken
          up.
          Bobby walks around the car evaluating the damage-
          The SUV tires are shredded - the rims buried into the ground.

                         BOBBY
          Holy shit!

          On the other side of the trailer, Brenda has gotten out and
          regained her senses. She takes a few steps, taking in the
          land surrounding them...
          The lunar terrain of sand and rocks extends beyond the
          horizon. In the distance, only the jagged hills are cut out
          against the sky. Something OMINOUS AND INDESCRIBABLE lives in
          this place...
          Behind the trailer, Doug walks off with his cell phone.

                         DOUG
          97% nationwide coverage, and we

          He searches desperately for a signal, extending his arm
          forward. Lynn grabs him tenderly by the waist.

          I hope he's enjoying himself.
          On his knees, by the SUV tires, Big Bob inspects under the
          vehicle... Not only are the tires flattened, but the front
          axel has buckled from hitting the rocks.

                         BIG BOB
          That old thing? Give it a try, but
          this is mining country. Whatever
          metal is left in those hills will
          probably scramble the signal...

          What are we going to do?
          Without answering, Big Bob gets back on his feet, wipes his
          hands and grabs a bottle of water from the car. After a long

          A hundred yards away, Bobby has come to retrieve the dogs.
          Beauty and Beast have stopped below a boulder extending
          twenty feet high. They bark and growl towards the top.

          cigarette butt in the sink. She's pissed. She picks it up and
          throws it away.

          Ethel takes it seriously, in that precise moment the arguing
          stops and the family seems united and strong.
          But seen from the surrounding summit, through Goggle's

          Beauty escapes to the hills.
          Bobby runs as fast as he can but cannot keep up. The dog gets
          further and further away, climbing up the side of the
          mountain.
          Beauty moves through the first series of rocks. Bobby loses
          sight of her and stops. Out of breath, he hesitates-
          Ahead, the rocky horizon shows no indication of a definite
          path.
          He spots Beauty climbing between some rocks and continues his
          chase.

                         BOBBY

          BEAUTY!
          At the bottom of the hill, the rocks are too jagged for him
          to continue running. He slows down and begins moving past the
          first set of rocks.
          With much more agility, Beauty climbs quickly towards the
          top, disappearing behind some rocks.

                         BOBBY (CONT-D)

          BEAUTY? BEAUTY?
          Nothing. Only sharp rocks stand before him.

          Bobby hesitates, then gathers his courage and decides to

          Jagged rock after jagged rock, Bobby slowly climbs towards
          the summit.

          He appears between two big stones reaching an intermediate
          zone before the top-

          erosion.

          A dangerous animal could be hiding behind any corner.
          A SHADOW PASSES BEHIND HIM.. Bobby doesn't notice.

          A THIN SHADOW ON THE GROUND. Someone or something is hiding
          behind a rock.
          Bobby freezes. He stares at the shadow. Who will make the
          first move?
          He makes the decision, creeping towards the shadow. Squeezing
          the stone, he lifts his hand to strike but stops when he

                         DISCOVERS-
          A YOUNG GIRL, ABOUT 14, WEARING HIS STOLEN SWEATSHIRT. She is
          about five feet tall and frail.
          The hood covers her head, partly hiding her face. She is
          rather pretty, even with her ABNORMALLY LARGE EYES...
          She trembles, frightened and intrigued by Bobby. What is this

          Ruby, come back!
          Once more, Bobby is alone in the labyrinth.
          On the other side, he finds a trail of blood as if a body had
          been dragged on the rocks.
          The bloody trail is still fresh and disappears behind another
          set of rocks a few feet away.
          Bobby hesitates, unsure of what he might find...
          As soon as he's around the outcropping to the other side
          Bobby sees something that stops him dead in his tracks.
          Before him, on the ground, is Beauty.
          Dead. Disemboweled.
          Bobby drops to his knees, disbelieving, his face turning

          is locked in a grimace of horrible pain and shock. And... the
          animal is missing its front right leg.
          DRIP... DRIP... DRIP... DROPS OF BLOOD fall on Bobby's hand -
          ABOVE HIM, PERCHED ON A ROCK, A FIGURE OBSERVES HIM. A man
          with an impressive build crouches like a monkey. He wears old
          clothes covered with dust, and a DERBY HAT on his head.
          Binoculars hang around his neck.

          IT'S GOGGLE.
          Goggle has no face, as if it were totally covered with wax.
          He has two little holes for nostrils and no ears. His mouth
          is like an opened wound sliced in his skin. His eyes are the
          only features which give him any human resemblance at all.
          Using his hand, Goggle devours something ferociously-

          BEAUTY'S LEG!
          Terrified, Bobby runs away.
          Goggle laughs from his rock.
          Bobby jumps down the hill.
          From the summit, Goggle continues feasting. A few yards away,
          Ruby's slender silhouette slides between the rocks. Goggle
          stops eating, sees Ruby, and throws her the remains. Ruby
          looks at the half-eaten leg in disgust, and pushes it away.

          GOGGLE (O.S.)
          (rough and deep)
          What's the matter Ruby.. .You don't
          like dog anymore?

          39 EXT. HILLS - DAY 39

          Moving at top speed, Bobby descends from the hills,
          occasionally glancing behind him.
          He jumps from one rock to the next. Anything to get out of
          this hellhole.
          He turns around one too many times and fails to see the sharp
          precipice ahead. He tries to stop, but it's too late.
          Bobby slides down a few feet before grabbing hold of a
          protruding rock. The rock tears his skin.
          Bobby tries to climb back up, losing his grip. He falls.
          His head hits the bottom. He loses consciousness.
          Behind him a RATTLESNAKE slithers rattling its tail.
          The snake zips its tongue around his face when -

          A WOODEN STICK WITH FORKED END, TRAPS THE SNARE'S HEAD TO THE

          GROUND SAVING BOBBY FROM A CERTAIN BITE.

          With the hood of the sweatshirt still over her head, RUBY
          WATCHES THE WOUNDED BOY TENDERLY with her big, abnormal eyes.

                         CUT TO:

          40 EXT. ROAD - END OF THE DAY 40

          Close on THE RED SUN on the horizon.
          We hear Doug, singing "California Dreaming" a capella.

                         DOUG
          "...All the leaves are brown and the
          sky is gray. I've been for a walk
          on a winter's day. I'd be safe and
          warm if I was in L.A... California
          dreamin..."
          After hours of walking down this road, his face shows signs
          of fatigue.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          I was in LA._ California
          Dreamin..."
          The lyrics resonate throughout the desert. Suddenly, he stops
          singing.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          What the hell?!

          IN FRONT OF HIM, ABOUT A HUNDRED YARDS AHEAD, THE ROAD ENDS-
          A mound of earth blocks the road like a wall, extending
          hundreds of yards on either side.
          Confused, Doug approaches the wall and starts climbing.
          Reaching the top, he takes off his sun clips from his glasses
          and tries to grasp what's on the other side-
          A HUGE ATOMIC CRATER, three hundred yards in. diameter.

          THE CRATER HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A GRAVEYARD FOR CARS, TRUCKS,

          TRAILER HOMES, MOTORCYCLES...
          Doug climbs down and wanders between the rusted vehicles.
          Doug lights a cigarette before continuing his inspection.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         40 CONTINUED: 40
          In the reflection of a shattered rear view mirror, we see him
          approaching another car.
          Dust completely covers the windows. Doug wipes one down to

                         LOOK INSIDE-
          He notices a baby seat still strapped to the back.
          The cars all seem to be in good condition, as if they were
          simply pushed into the crater.
          He leans down towards another car-
          Barbed wire is rolled around the flattened tires...
          As Doug looks around in confusion, trying to figure out what
          this place might be, THE CAMERA CRANES UP TO A WIDE AERIAL
          SHOT - revealing five or six others craters.

          41 EXT. TRAILER - MAGIC HOUR 41

          It's getting colder.
          Lynn warms her hands at a fire in front of the trailer.
          A few feet away, Brenda collects firewood while calling out
          her brother's name...

                         BRENDA

          BOBBY! BOB-BY!
          Inside the camper, Ethel watches the sun set in the horizon.
          She cradles the baby in her arms.
          Brenda joins Lynn and throws some firewood into the flames.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
          (looking at the hills)
          We should've gone looking for him
          when it was still light out. I'm
          nervous.

          Keep it together Brenda, Mom is
          already worried enough... The fire
          will help Bobby find his way back.

                         BRENDA
          What if he doesn't come back? Maybe
          he's hurt. Maybe there was an
          accident...

          42 EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 42

          Clouds pass, revealing an almost full moon. Wind blows around
          the dark gas station.
          Between the broken-down cars, we see Big Bob approaching on
          the road.
          A rusty tea pot sits on a pile of trash and whistles in the
          wind. By placing his hand on the spout, Big Bob stops the
          whistling and silence returns.
          Whistling. Silence. Whistling.
          Big Bob walks to the porch.

                         BIG BOB

          HELLO! ANYONE HERE?!
          No answer. He knocks on the door.

          BIG BOB (CONT'D)
          It's Bob Carter, I got some gas
          from you a couple of hours ago.
          Still nothing. Big Bob draws his gun and opens the door when-

          SILENCE.
          From the other side of the house, the whistling has stopped.

          BIG BOB (CONT'D)
          Anybody there? Answer me!
          After a few seconds, the whistling returns.

                         (CONTINUED)

          Big Bob shrugs it off and enters.

          43 INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT 43

          Holding his gun, Big Bob steps into the empty gas station
          store. A faint light comes from the back room. The wind blows
          dust through the broken windows...
          Vigilantly, he moves through the empty shelves, behind the
          counter and past the beaded curtain separating the two rooms.
          The light bulb above the dining table is on.

                         BIG BOB
          Somebody home? Hello?
          Big Bob pushes the last door leading to the back room.
          His hand feels for the light switch.
          CLICK - an old lamp comes on in the corner.
          He finds a wall mounted phone and picks up the receiver.
          No tone.

          BIG BOB (CONT'D)

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Dammit...
          Through the window, Big Bob sees a pick-up truck.
          He starts searching for the keys.
          Going through the different rooms, he discovers a drawer full
          of money, jewels, watches, credit cards... A REAL FORTUNE.
          He spots a key chain hanging from a nail next to the desk. He
          reaches for the keys when something else grabs his attention-
          Partially hidden in the dark, he discovers a few family
          photos and a few newspaper clippings from the 1950s pinned to
          the wallpaper.
          Big Bob lights the desk lamp and turns it towards the wall-
          His face goes cold-
          On the aged photos, we recognize the old gas station
          attendant in his younger days, next to his wife and his

                         CHILDREN-

          ABNORMAL CHILDREN GRUESOME AND DEFORMED BY NATURE...
          Cleft lips, tumors, uneven extremities, malformations, skin
          diseases, and gangrene of the face...

          THEY ARE ALL AFFECTED BY GENETIC ABNORMALITIES.
          On a more recent polaroid, we can recognize Ruby at 6 years
          old. Besides her three fingers and big eyes, half of her
          skull is missing or caved in.
          Another polaroid - in a wheelchair, a little boy has
          difficulty holding up his hugely disproportionate head.
          The headline from the clippings makes Big Bob understand the
          origins of these horrors-
          "New Mexico- Nuclear enters a new age."
          ".. .Miner town evacuated"
          "Miners refuse to abandon their lands by hiding in

                         MINES"
          "Military destroys miner's town."
          The old man's family was. one of those families whose genetic
          lineage was forever changed by the nuclear fallout.
          Big Bob is shocked, never believing such a thing was
          possible.

          A COUPLE OF MORE RECENT ARTICLES MENTION PEOPLE DISAPPEARING

          IN THE REGION.

          BIG BOB (CONT'D)
          You son of a bitch...
          Worried for his own family, he grabs the keys and walks out.
          From the bedroom window, we see him running to the pick-up
          truck.

          44 INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 44

          Big Bob slams the door, starts the engine and turns on the
          headlights.
          The headlights shine on the outhouse.
          The wooden outhouse door slams back and forth in the wind.
          Something blocks it from shutting completely-

          A voice comes to him. A MAN SOBBING-

          Wide eyed, he stands and throws himself on the car door.

          It's PAPA JUPITER.

          Bloodied and screaming, Big Bob is dragged out of the car in

          Mayday ...mayday... This is a

          Still nothing.

          50 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 50

          Lynn's distress call is heard from the trailer isolated in
          the middle of the desert.

                         LYNN
          Mayday. . .We're stranded in the
          desert, we need help...mayday...
          Suddenly, the light on the C/B turns green and static can be
          heard. Ethel grabs her daughter's hand, hopeful that someone
          may have heard them.
          A second later, HEAVY BREATHING is heard over the radio.
          The light turns off. The two women look at each other in
          confusion.

                         LYNN (CONT'D)
          What was that?

          It sounded like an animal...
          Lynn stands up worried.

          Lynn, wait.
          Ethel stays alone with the baby.

          Still tied to the trailer, Beast growls and pulls on his
          chain.
          Lynn raises the collar of her jacket to protect herself from
          the wind and moves closer to the fire.

          With a flashlight in one hand, the gun in the other, and a

          Ruby is still at his side, observing him silently.
          She hears Brenda's calls and runs away.

          Bobby slowly opens an eye, regaining his senses. Blood has
          coagulated on his face. He turns his head in the direction of
          his sister's voice, realizing that it's night. How long has
          he been unconscious?

          Beast strains on his chain, a low growl of rage coming from
          his chest.

          55 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 55

          Inside the trailer-
          The first aid kit is open on the table. Even with a blanket
          around his shoulders, Bobby shivers.
          Ethel soaks cotton in alcohol using it to clean his wounds.

                         ETHEL
          You're lucky Brenda found you.
          Imagine if you had to spend the
          whole night out there in the cold.
          Bobby winces from the pain.

                         BRENDA
          Don't worry, Beauty will come back
          when she's hungry...
          Bobby doesn't answer. He keeps the truth to himself, not
          wanting to worry his family.

                         BOBBY

          I want you guys to stay in here.
          Brenda?! You hear me?
          Gun in hand, he opens the door-
          Bobby is about to shoot when a figure emerges from the dark.
          IT'S DOUG, holding as much as he could carry from the car
          graveyard.

          What the fuck are you doing? Don't

          Quickly, Lynn exits the trailer and jumps into her husband's
          arms. They kiss.

          Look what I found.
          Various tools, a fishing pole...

          With all of this, we can find a way
          to fix the car, right Bobby?
          Bobby doesn't answer.

          I found this really huge crater at
          the end of the road! I've never

                         DOUG
          Stop! Stop, you're tickling me!
          Lynn continues with more fervor.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Oh, so you want to play?
          He turns around and starts tickling her as well. They laugh
          together before kissing passionately.

                         LYNN
          I love you...

                         DOUG
          I love you too...
          They start making out.

          62 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 62

          At the same time A HAND opens the gas tank and unscrews the
          cover.

          59.

                         62 CONTINUED: 62
          In total silence, the hand slips a rubber hose into the tank
          and starts siphoning gas. We follow the hose up to the
          monstrous mouth of-
          PLUTO - The deformed bald giant with a child's face. But a
          child with a thick, primal cruelty snapping in his
          asymmetrical, protruding eyes.
          Silently, Pluto siphons some of the Carter's gas into a gas
          can.
          Lynn's hand presses against the window, as she and her
          husband continue, unaware.
          Pluto laughs stupidly, excited by the situation. His large
          smile reveals POINTY SHARK-LIKE TEETH.
          Once the gas can is full, he waves at somebody hidden in the
          dark.

          63 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 63

          Brenda rests on her bed. Exhausted, she turns off the bed
          lamp,. and slides under the sheets. She falls asleep listening
          to the music.
          In the other room of the trailer, Bobby's watch reads
          11:45pm. Bobby is restless. He doesn't know what to do.
          A few feet away, Ethel sleeps on the couch.
          Suddenly, Bobby hears barking in the distance.

                         BOBBY
          Beast?!
          He grabs the gun and exits the trailer, leaving the door
          open.

          64 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 64

          Bobby moves into the night. Beast is still barking somewhere
          in the dark.
          As he passes the SUV, he overhears the moaning and heavy
          breathing coming from inside.
          His flashlight moves over the desert terrain and the
          occasional bush. He calls out to his dog, trying not to wake
          anyone.

                         BOBBY
          Beast? Come on, boy. You hear me!
          Come on now.
          Bobby moves further from the trailer towards the barking.

          HIS FLASHLIGHT PASSES QUICKLY OVER A SHAPE HIDING IN THE

          BUSHES!
          Bobby shines the light on the bush and approaches-
          Nothing. It must have been his imagination.
          The barking becomes a ferocious growl.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Beast? Beast? Its me. Come on...
          All of a sudden the growling becomes a "mooing" cow.
          Then a goat. Then a chicken.
          Terrified, Bobby turns around and runs back toward the SUV.

          65 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 65

          In the living room, Ethel sleeps.
          At the other end, Brenda turns under the sheets. The muted
          bass coming from the iPod drums on in the background.

          A GNARLED HAND ENTERS FRAME AND BRUSHES A STRAND OF HAIR FROM

          BRENDA'S FACE SO STEALTHILY THAT SHE DOESN'T EVEN STIR.

          IT'S PLUTO. THE DIVERSION OUTSIDE HAS ALLOWED HIM TO ENTER.
          He stands above Brenda watching her sleep, an innocent smile
          on his face. His hand softly grazes her hair as if she was a
          kitten, then pulls on the sheets to expose her body.
          Pluto covers her mouth, silencing her. BRENDA'S EYES OPEN

          WIDE.

          66 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 66

          Panting and panicked, Bobby knocks on the SUV's tailgate
          window, interrupting Lynn and Doug.

                         BOBBY
          Doug! Doug!
          Caught red-handed, Lynn dresses and Doug pulls up his pants.

          What do you want, Bobby?

                         BOBBY
          Come on, open up!
          Lynn opens the back window giving him a dirty look.

                         LYNN
          This had better be important.
          Bobby is too scared to keep the truth hidden. He regains his
          calm before talking.

                         BOBBY
          Something's going on around here.
          We're not alone.
          Exasperated, Lynn takes a deep breath, not taking him
          seriously.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          I know this sounds weird, but there
          are people living in those hills.

                         LYNN
          Bobby... We're in the middle of
          nowhere. Believe me, no one could
          survive out here!

                         BOBBY
          I saw them. And Beauty...

                         DOUG
          Beauty what?

                         BOBBY
          They cut out her insides.

                         LYNN
          What are you talking about?

                         BOBBY
          Her guts were all over the place...
          He struggles to talk.

          I...I didn't want to scare you so I
          didn't say anything, but
          something's going on... You even
          said you heard some breathing on
          the radio didn't you?
          Lynn nods.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          We're not alone, I'm telling you...
          Doug exits the car. Obviously, Bobby is not kidding.

                         DOUG
          Calm down Bobby, OK? Let's go check
          it out together. Lynn, stay right
          here.

          67 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 67

          From the window, we can see Bobby and Doug walking to the
          trailer.
          In the back room, Pluto hears them, grabs his walkie-talkie

                         AND GROWLS-

                         PLUTO
          Noaowww!

          68 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 68

          AT THAT MOMENT, an explosion takes place a few hundred yards
          away from the trailer.
          The flames climb into the air lighting the surrounding rocky
          desert.
          SOMEONE SCREAMS. Doug and Bobby turn around.

          IT'S BIG BOB!
          He has been crucified to a Joshua tree and transformed into a

          HUMAN TORCH...
          The explosion and the screaming has awakened Ethel who comes
          out of the trailer in her nightgown. Recognizing his screams,
          she runs to her burning husband.

                         ETHEL

          IT'S BOB! IT'S BOB!

          Doug tries to hold her back, but she is determined to get to
          him.

          69 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 69

          Doug runs into the trailer grabbing a fire extinguisher and
          some blankets. In the panic, he fails to see Brenda
          restrained by Pluto.

                         DOUG

                         (PANICKED)
          Brenda, stay with Catherine!
          He jumps out without waiting for an answer.
          Pluto gives Brenda a satisfied smile- NO ONE WILL BOTHER THEM

          NOW.

          70 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 70

          Doug runs out leaving the door wide open.
          Someone jumps from the roof and, on all fours, lands in front
          of the door. He stands and, for the first time, we see the
          face of -
          LIZARD - Pluto's cousin.
          Lizard is as thin as Pluto is imposing. Extremely pale, his
          face is disfigured by A CLEFT LIP WHICH EXPOSES HIS DEFORMED

          JAW. A SAVAGE WITH NO SENSE OF PITY, LIZARD IS, AFTER PAPA

          JUPITER, THE MOST VIOLENT INHABITANT OF THE HILLS.
          Lizard has Big Bob's Magnum. He enters the trailer and closes
          the door behind him.

          71 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 71

          Big Bob screams as the flames devour his naked flesh.
          His fingers tighten. His bloodied face distorts with pain.
          Even his eyes are burnt. Considering the condition of his
          body, it's a miracle he's still alive...
          Doug arrives with the extinguisher and begins putting out the
          fire under Ethel's horrified, watchful eye.

          72 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 72

          Back inside the trailer.

                         72 CONTINUED: 72
          With a wicked smile on his face, Lizard puts on Ethel's apron
          and places her flowery sun hat on his head. This disturbed
          mind takes pleasure in dressing up in "Mama's clothes"...
          Then, famished, he eats everything he can find in the
          trailer.
          Raw meat, fruit, potato chips... He washes it all down with
          milk, orange juice...
          His eyes stop on the bird cage. He smiles.
          Lizard moves closer, opens the cage and grabs one of the
          parrakeets.
          The small bird looks around in confusion.

          HE TEARS OFF ITS HEAD AND SQUEEZES THE BLOOD INTO HIS MOUTH!
          Blood drips on his chin.
          Brenda's muted screams attract his attention.
          Lizard walks across the trailer. HE WANTS HIS SHARE.
          He pushes Pluto violently to the ground.

                         LIZARD
          Move!
          (with a smile)
          You gotta be a man to do that...
          Pluto is outraged and tries to stand up. He wants to talk but
          no words come out. JUST GRUNTS AND GROWLS.
          Lizard savagely hits him several times.
          Behind them, terrified, Brenda watches helplessly as they
          fight.
          Lizard puts his foot on Pluto's face, pinning him to the
          ground, and then points the gun to his head.

                         LIZARD (CONT'D)
          I told ya to move!
          Pluto moves away and, in a fit of rage, breaks everything in
          the trailer. Dishes, chairs, table... everything.
          Lizard laughs like a goon. He grabs Brenda by her feet and
          pulls her to him.

          Excited and amused at the same time, he stares at Brenda's
          appetizing calf muscle. He smells it, licks it, and then,
          without hesitation, plunges his teeth into her leg.

          73 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 73

          Brenda's muted screams are heard from inside the trailer.

          74 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 74

          The flames have been replaced by white smoke.
          Doug unties Big Bob. His body falls motionless to the ground.

          COMPLETELY CARBONIZED, HE HAS STOPPED BREATHING.
          Smoke comes out of his mouth.
          Doug uses the blanket to extinguish the last flames.
          Behind Doug, Ethel looks at her husband refusing to accept
          the truth.

                         ETHEL
          No..No.. It's not possible. That's
          not Bob. That's not my Bob.
          She grabs Doug by his shirt trying to convince him.

          Doug.. It's not him. Tell me it's
          not him. It's not my Bob!
          The poor woman has lost her mind. Ethel erupts in laughter
          pointing to her dead husband.

                         ETHEL (CONT'D)

                         (HYSTERICALLY)
          That is not my Bob! That is not my

          Lynn and Bobby are paralyzed. Doug turns to his wife.

                         DOUG
          Take your mother away from here!
          With her eyes fixed on her father, Lynn walks her mother
          away.
          In Bobby's eyes, sadness has been replaced by hatred. Full of
          rage, the youngster grabs the gun and walks away.

          Returning to the trailer, Lynn struggles to restrain Ethel.
          Ethel finally realizes it's too late for her husband and
          collapses into her daughter's arms.
          Just then, a muffled scream from Brenda pierces the night.

                         LYNN
          Oh my god!
          Lynn runs inside leaving her mother alone.

          76 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 76

          Bursting into the trailer, Lynn stops on a dime when she sees
          Lizard, in Ethel's clothes, holding the baby.
          Behind him, Pluto restrains Brenda.
          Lizard walks up with the baby.

                         LIZARD

          Big fat baby good.., you fat... Fat
          and juicy!
          Lynn is paralyzed with fear.

          Baby... Baby...
          Instinctively, Lynn grabs the closest thing, a FRYING PAN,
          and hits Lizard brutally in the face.

          Stunned, he falls to the ground and drops the baby, who
          begins to wail.
          when he lifts his head, Lynn strikes again-
          He blocks her arm and twists it, bringing her to her knees.
          Lynn tries to fight him off, but he is too strong.
          Still restrained, Brenda spots the PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER under
          the sleeper. The one Bobby had used to fix the A/C.
          At the other end of the trailer, Lizard has immobilized Lynn
          and POINTS THE GUN AT THE BABY!
          Lynn stops.

          Without a word, Lizard tears off Lynn's shirt and bra.
          The gun stays pointed at the baby as-
          Lizard removes Ethel's sun hat and hovers over Lynn's
          breast...
          Seen from behind her shoulder, we can't figure out exactly
          what this mental case is doing... Is he nursing from her
          breast?
          Lynn trembles, but can only think of her baby and her sister,
          who are still threatened.
          Excited by what his brother is doing, Pluto fondles Brenda.
          Suddenly, Ethel jumps into the trailer with a broom and
          starts batting away at Lizard.
          For once, her adrenaline kicks in as she fights for the most
          important thing in her life - Her family.
          The broom has little effect and is almost comical...
          BANG! - Lizard shoots Ethel in her chest, throwing her back.

          77 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 77

          From far away, Bobby hears the gunshot. He quickly turns
          around to help his family.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

          78 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 78

          In the trailer home, Brenda takes advantage of the confusion
          to get away from Pluto and grabs the Phillips screwdriver
          from beneath the sleeper.
          Brenda slides the screwdriver to Lynn who raises it and is
          about to strike when-
          BANG! - Lynn is shot in the chest.
          Lizard turns to Brenda and aims at her head.
          He is about to shoot when Lynn, with her last breath-

          PLANTS THE PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER IN HIS THIGH. IT STARTS

          TEARING THROUGH HIS FLESH!
          Lizard screams in pain and turns the gun back to Lynn-
          BANG! - He blows off part of her skull.
          Blood splatters throughout the cabin.

          79 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 79

          Alarmed by the gunfire, Doug gets up and looks at the trailer
          in the distance. He doesn't know what to do.
          Bobby appears behind him-

                         BOBBY
          Come on Doug! They're in the
          trailer-!
          They both take off running.

          80 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 80

          Witness to the slaughter, Brenda is petrified with fear.
          Lizard pulls out the screwdriver and stands with difficulty.
          He picks up the baby and hands it to Pluto.

                         LIZARD
          Take it.
          Pluto obeys. Lizard grabs Brenda by the hair and pulls her
          out of the trailer.

          Come on bitch...
          She screams and resists by grabbing at furniture and pulling
          off the curtains...
          Her nails scratch against the paneling.

          BEFORE LEAVING, LIZARD RIPS THE JEWELRY FROM ETHEL AND LYNN'S

          BODY...

          81 EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT 81

          Brenda is pulled out by Lizard.
          When he sees Bobby and Doug approaching, Lizard changes his

                         MIND-

          HE INSERTS THE BARREL OF HIS GUN INTO BRENDA'S MOUTH...
          Brenda is wide eyed. Without hesitating, Lizard pulls the

                         TRIGGER-
          CLICK! - no more bullets.
          Lizard drops Brenda.

                         LIZARD
          I'll come back for ya...
          Lizard disappears into the night.
          Brenda lays on the ground trembling and crying.
          Doug arrives at the trailer, while Bobby aims the 9mm at the
          assassins.

          BANG! BANG! BANG!
          It's too late. They're gone.
          Bobby runs to his traumatized sister laying on the ground. He
          holds her in his arms, trying to calm her down.
          Doug approaches the open door. He notices bloody hand prints
          along the side of the trailer home- One of the attackers has
          been hurt...

          82 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 82

          Doug enters the trailer unable to imagine the tragedy.

                         82 CONTINUED: 82
          Horrified, he discovers Ethel on the couch, not quite dead,
          but short of breath and in pain.
          Doug is stone faced-

          ON THE GROUND, LYNN'S BODY, HIS OWN WIFE, SOAKS IN HER BLOOD!
          His eyes fill with tears. He tries to keep from crying but
          his sadness is too deep.
          His hand approaches her face. His fingers graze her hair.

          SUDDENLY, LYNN'S BODY SUFFERS A LAST MUSCLE SPASM, LIKE A

          CIRCUIT SHORTING OUT.
          Doug tries to breathe life back into her body, but death has
          overtaken her open eyes. He closes them and starts weeping.
          The music from the Fisher Price mobile is the only other
          sound...
          Doug turns around. THE CRIB IS EMPTY...

                         DOUG

                         (SOFTLY)
          No...No...
          He squeezes his fist with rage.

          83 EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 83

          At the foot of the burnt tree, Big Bob's body is laid out on
          some rocks, the blanket over his face.
          A few figures emerge out of the darkness and gather around
          the body like a pack of hyenas.

          BIG BOB IS DRAGGED AWAY THROUGH THE DUST...

                         CUT TO:

          84 EXT. HILLS - NIGHT 84

          Backlit by the moon, at the top of the hill, we find Goggle
          and his binoculars.
          Reflecting in the lenses, we see the carters' trailer glowing
          in the night.
          A rustling noise attracts his attention.

          Before Goggle can turn around, a wild animal jumps at his
          face- IT'S BEAST.
          The German shepherd tears at Goggle's face and locks deep
          into his throat. Goggle tries to fight it off, but the animal
          is determined to kill.
          Goggle grabs AN OLD RAZOR out of his pocket and tries to cut
          the animal.
          The dog bites down tightening its grip. BONES CRACK.
          He drops the razor. Goggle's derby hat falls between some
          rocks.

          BEAST AVENGES BEAUTY IN A BLOODFEST!
          Someone calls him on the on walkie-talkie-

          RADIO (O.S.)
          "Goggle? Goggle..."
          Goggle will not answer anymore...

          85 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 85

          Laid out on the couch, Ethel agonizes between life and death.
          Brenda stares into space, saying nothing. Doug touches her
          head as he passes. Instinctively, she backs off terrified.
          Across the trailer, Bobby paces back and forth.

                         BOBBY

                         (PANICKED)
          What are we going to do Doug? What
          are we going to do if they come
          back?
          Completely defeated, Doug comes back and goes to Ethel's
          side.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Doug!
          Doug does not answer and takes Ethel's hand. She opens her
          eyes and looks at him as if nothing happened.

                         ETHEL
          This camper's so small. No matter
          how much you clean, it's always a

          Is Big Bob home?

                         DOUG
          Not yet.

                         ETHEL
          Did everyone go to bed?

                         DOUG
          Yes, Brenda is here and Bobby is in
          the kitchen.
          At the other end, Bobby turns away, crying. Brenda looks away
          as well.

                         ETHEL
          (short of breath)
          Is Lynn sleeping?
          Doug holds back the tears.

                         DOUG
          Yes..
          (after a beat)
          Do you need anything?
          Ethel finds it more and more difficult to talk.

                         ETHEL
          Look in the closet Doug, I'm sure I
          have another blanket. I'm so cold.
          Doug tucks one of the blankets around her.

                         DOUG

                         (REASSURING)
          There's one here. Nice and warm.

                         ETHEL
          You've always been so sweet. I
          understand why Lynn loves you so
          much.
          She raises her arm to caress his face.
          Her hand falls on the bed. Lifeless.
          Brenda screams, bursting into tears.

          At the same time Bobby pounds his fist against a wall. His
          eyes full of hate, he joins Doug.

                         BOBBY

                         (DETERMINED)
          Come on! I'm not going to take this
          shit...
          Doug gets mad as well.

          DON'T BE STUPID! WE'RE NOT GOING

          ANYWHERE, DO YOU HEAR ME?

                         BOBBY
          Fine. You stay here. I'm going
          after them.
          Doug gets between Bobby and the door, preventing the kid from
          leaving.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)

          Doug drags him in front of his mother's body.

          Look! Look at what they did to your
          mother. Look at what they did to

          Brenda throws herself into Doug's arms.
          Bobby stares at the bullet holes in the trailer door.
          Suddenly, the sound of a radio is heard-

          From outside we can see Doug's eye through one of the bullet
          holes. Nobody, everything seems quiet.

          Get ready Bobby..
          Doug opens the door and jumps out ready to fight.
          From beneath the trailer, someone observes him...
          Doug bends down and discovers-
          GOGGLE'S SEVERED ARM. In its hand, the walkie-talkie still
          works.

          Bobby is about to join him when Doug signals-

          THERE'S SOMEONE HIDING UNDER THE TRAILER.
          Without a sound, Bobby aims the gun at the kitchen floor.
          Outside, Doug backs up to see who is hiding.
          Behind the step ladder, he sees an inert shape in the
          shadows.
          BANG! - Bobby shoots through the floor. Immediately, the
          shadowy figure jumps out into the light-

          Beast!
          The dog jumps into Doug's arms and begins licking his face.
          Bobby can't believe it, his dog has returned.
          Radio static comes back on the walkie. Bobby picks it up-

          her back to me...
          More static...

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

          DO YOU HEAR ME?!
          Silence. Suddenly we hear-

          CATHERINE'S CRIES ON THE RADIO!
          Doug drops the radio, scared speechless...

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          How much ammo do you have left?

                         BOBBY
          I don't know, half a clip?

          77.

          86 INT. DARK PLACE - NIGHT 86

          On a dimly lit wooden table, Catherine lays, wrapped in a
          blanket.
          A butcher's knife is planted next to her...
          Asthmatic breathing, and the sound of running water punctuate
          the silence.
          Ruby steps out of the darkness and moves towards the baby.
          She watches through her abnormally large eyes and extends her
          stringy fingers to touch the baby.
          A large screen splits the room in two.
          A strangely shaped shadow moves behind the screen: A
          HANDICAPPED BODY washed by A LARGE WOMAN...
          An empty wheel chair rests in a corner.
          Amused, Ruby looks at the baby who smiles back. She carefully
          takes Catherine in her arms when the invalid's voice

                         INTERRUPTS-

          LARGE WOMAN (O.S.)
          Put that down Ruby... You know
          better than to play with your
          food...
          Ruby takes a step back, hugging the baby tighter.

                         - RUBY
          Mama, pleaaase...

          HANDICAPPED (O.S.)
          (weak asthmatic voice)
          Listen to your mother Ruby and put
          that baby down... Now!
          Frightened, Ruby obeys and quickly runs out of the room.
          The baby starts crying...

          hear me?
          Something has gone off in her eyes. She is absent, no longer
          living, just surviving.
          Doug is about to leave, taking with him anything from the
          trailer which might be useful.

          BASEBALL BAT, FLASHLIGHT, PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER...

                         BOBBY
          Let me go with you.

                         DOUG
          No, you stay here with your sister
          and stay by the radio. Somebody's
          bound to hear us.
          Brenda continues her distress call.

          Mayday...mayday... Can anybody hear

          The sun'll be up soon. One of them
          is hurt, I'm going to follow his
          trail through the hills.
          Bobby pulls out the 9mm gun and hands it to him.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          No. You keep it in case they come
          back.

                         BOBBY
          What about you?

                         DOUG
          Don't worry about me, I'll take
          Beast.
          Beast sits at his feet ready to go. Doug straps the walkie-
          talkie over his shoulder.

                         BOBBY

          I... I didn't mean what I said...
          Doug hugs him like a brother.
          Before walking out, he bends down to Lynn's body and kisses
          her one last time on the mouth.

                         DOUG
          I'm going to find.our baby my
          love...I promise.

          88 EXT. HILLS - SUNRISE 88

          The first sign of dawn lights the distant horizon.
          The vultures perched on a dead Joshua Tree swivel their heads
          around, to see a distant, running FIGURE -
          DOUG AND BEAST, moving steadily among the rocks.

          89 EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - DAY 89

          Doug and Beast arrive at the old mine's entrance on the side
          of the hill. The trail of blood leads inside.
          Doug hides behind a rock. Sweating, he catches his breath.
          Beast breathes heavily as well. Doug remembers what his wife
          always used to say-

                         DOUG
          (to the dog)
          I told you to stop smoking.
          Doug sets a different frequency on his radio-

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          (Into the walkie)
          Bobby? Bobby? You read me?

          BOBBY (O.S.)
          Yeah, Doug...

                         DOUG

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          I'm not sure if I'll get a signal
          from inside. If you don't hear from
          me in a half an hour, you're on
          your own.

                         (A BEAT)
          Bobby?

                         BOBBY
          Yeah... Good luck, Doug.
          He puts the walkie away and takes out the flashlight.

                         DOUG

                         (TO BEAST)
          You ready big guy? I hope you're
          not afraid of the dark.
          He pets the dog one final time and stands up.

          90 INT. MINE - DAY 90

          With the light from the entrance behind him, shadow enters
          the mine.
          The beam from his flashlight follows the trail of blood on
          the ground.
          The wooden pylons which have held up the walls for a hundred
          years threaten to crumble at any second.
          Only static on the radio. Doug turns it off.
          He moves further into the darkness, probing with his
          flashlight into the inky pit.
          Doug arrives at a fork splitting the tunnel off in two
          different directions.
          Doug lights each tunnel with the flashlight until he finds
          the one with-the blood trail, then continues on into that
          one. Tracking.
          Suddenly he stops.
          The beam of the flashlight has revealed TWO DOZEN PICKAXES
          that have been planted in the ground over mounds. That look
          very much like graves. The pickaxes look eerily like crosses,
          given the whole place the feel of A SUBTERRANEAN GRAVEYARD.
          Hanging from the graves, dates and portraits of all the
          miners who have died here, including women and children...
          The flashlight dims. Doug taps it to no avail.

                         (CONTINUED)

                          DOUG
           Come on. You can't be serious.
           Then light goes. completely off, leaving Doug in darkness.
          Scratch! - He lights a match.
          Holding the tiny flame, Doug continues down the tunnel until
          he arrives at another fork. He can no longer see the blood
          trail.

          A SHAPE SLIDES SWIFTLY BEHIND HIM!

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          (to Beast, meaning

                         HIMSELF)
          Just stay calm, boy...
          A gust of air kills the match.
          He immediately lights another-
          Again, THE DRAFT SNUFFS IT OUT.
          He turns around, looking for the source of the air, and
          notices a reflection of light at the end of the tunnel.
          He moves towards the reflection.

          91 EST. MINE EXIT - DAY 91
          On the other side of the hill, the collapsed wooden beams and
          stones block part of the mine's exit.
          Doug emerges with Beast. His eyes takes a moment to adapt to
          the bright sunlight.
          He. cannot believe what he sees. At the bottom of a hill, A

          SMALL TOWN - A CLASSIC ONE-STREET TOWN BUILT BACK IN THE

          50'S.
          Doug turns the walkie on.

                         DOUG

                         (ENTHUSIASTIC)
          .Bobby, Bobby, it's Doug... I
          can't believe it! I found a street
          and some houses. Maybe somebody
          does live here...
          The radio remains silent.

                         (CONTINUED)

          Bobby, do you hear me? Bobby?
          Still nothing. Doug turns around and looks up-
          A wall of rock towers behind him.
          He tries one last time, but the signal won't go through.

          92 INT. TRAILER - DAY 92

          Close up on the C/B radio in the trailer-
          Only static comes from the speakers.

          93 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 93

           Brenda drags one of the tires from the SUV 30 feet away.
           She douses it with lighter fluid and-
          Whoosh! - a match sets it on fire creating a thick, black,
          smoke signal.
          Brenda joins her brother who is busy planting wooden stakes
          in a circle fifty meters around the trailer.

                         BRENDA
          Maybe somebody heard our calls..

                         BOBBY
          Nobody's going to find us Brenda,
          even with that smoke...Nobody's
          coming._.. You heard what Doug
          said-We're alone now, just you
          and me. Let them come, I'm waiting
          for them.
          Now, Bobby stretches the nylon wire from the fishing pole
          around each stake. He sets the fishing pole next to the
          trailer, rigging to it one of Catherine's TOY SHAKERS-
          An improvised alarm system.

          94 EXT. HILLS - DAY 94

          At the summit, somebody observes the trailer and the thick
          cloud of smoke rising to the air.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

          95 EXT. TOWN - DAY 95

          Doug runs down the hills towards the town. Behind him, from
          the mouth of the mine, someone observes between the rocks-
          it's Ruby.
          Doug slows his pace as he enters Main Street. The town is
          deserted. No sign of life anywhere. All the houses and cars
          are covered with a thick layer of dust.
          Taking a closer look, he realizes all the parked cars are
          from the 50's.
          Uncertain, Doug walks through the ghost town, with Beast at
          his side...
          No movement besides the wind blowing and lifting an
          occasional cloud of dust. Doug walks up to a house and knocks
          on the front door.
          No one to open the door. Doug wipes one of the windows-
          It's too dark inside to see anything. The door is unlocked,
          Doug pushes it.
          It squeaks open. He hesitates before entering.

          96 INT. FIRST HOUSE - DAY 96

          Sunlight passes through the dusty windows revealing a
          living/dining room decorated from the 50's.
          Doug can't believe his eyes-
          Through the kitchen door, he can see a woman doing dishes.
          A man sits in the living room reading a newspaper.
          Children play in front of the blank TV set...

          THESE ARE NOT REAL PEOPLE BUT MANNEQUINS!
          They have been dressed and placed into real life situations.

          THE ATOMIC SYMBOL CAN BE FOUND ON EACH OF THEIR FOREHEADS.
          Doug spots a telephone behind the staircase and checks for a
          dial tone.
          Nothing. He picks up the phone casing.

          EMPTY. JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE HOUSE, IT'S FARE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

          97 EXT. TOWN - DAY 97

          Doug quickly crosses Main Street to visit another house.

          98 INT. SECOND HOUSE - DAY 98

          New interior- New surreal setting.
          Around a table, a family of test dummies eat dinner.

          99 EXT. TOWN - DAY 99

          Stupefied, Doug enters yet another house.
          The door remains open as we see another family of dummies
          living a perfect little life. A LIFE WHICH STOPPED IN THE

          LATE 50'S...
          Around the corner of a house, a little girl dummy is sitting
          on a swing, her face half broken.
          A second later, Doug thinks he hears CHILDREN LAUGHING. He

                         TURNS AROUND-
          Nothing but the wind blowing through the houses.
          Doug takes Catherine's bib from his pocket and lets Beast get
          its scent.

                         DOUG
          Find her, Beast, find Catherine...
          With his nose to the ground, the dog pulls Doug straight
          ahead.
          Doug walks away through the streets, pulled by the dog.
          On the outskirts of town, we discover a fence buried in the
          sand. On it, an old metallic sign reads-

          TEST SITE 3B - MILITARY ZONE - HIGH RADIATION RISK
          The scent leads Doug into an alley off the main street.
          He sees an old generator on full throttle. A thick smoke
          pours from the exhaust.

          SOMEONE LIVES HERE!
          His daughter could be there...

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         99 CONTINUED: 99
          Doug tries to see into the windows, but they are caked in
          filth. He decides to go around when-

          A MAN WALKS INTO VIEW WITHOUT SEEING HIM!
          Immediately, Doug backs away.
          The man drags a cadaver by its feet. Half of the dead body
          is missing, having apparently been torn off.
          Beast GROWLS.
          The man turns around, revealing his horrible face-
          A METALLIC BRACE is screwed on four sides of his head helping
          him stand straight. ENORMOUS CYSTS DISFIGURE HIM AND COVER
          EVERY VISIBLE PART OF HIS BODY. Let's call him "CYST".
          Cyst traces back his steps, trying to find what caused the
          noise. He holds the gas station attendant's shotgun!
          The alley is empty. The generators are still motoring.
          All seems normal. Cyst turns back towards main street.
          Cyst passes an old'parked car without seeing Doug and the dog
          hidden inside.
          Doug breathes a sigh of relief. Close call.
          Quietly, Doug gets out of the car. He hesitates as to whether
          he should bring Beast with him or to leave him in the car.
          The dog could be his best weapon but, on the other hand, he
          also represents a_bigger risk to be spotted.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)

                         (SOFTLY)
          You wait here Beast! Come on,
          sit!... Good boy. I'm gonna find
          Catherine...
          The dog is confused and whines through the half-opened
          window.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          Shhhh... Quiet Beast... Don't move!
          I'll be back...
          He closes the car door and starts down the alley, lowering
          his head.

          From inside the car, Beast watches Doug getting further
          away...
          Doug sneaks along the side of the building towards the front
          door.
          He hesitates, unsure of what awaits him inside-

          102 INT. HOUSE - DAY 102

          Doug crosses a doorway without making a sound. He enters the
          front hall squeezing the bat in his hands.
          Something in the air, A DISGUSTING SMELL, catches his
          attention. Doug moves slowly and discovers, in the dining
          room, sitting amongst the dummies-

          BIG BOB'S CHARRED BODY!
          His father-in-law's arms have been torn off and devoured. THE
          AMERICAN FLAG that used to adorn his SUV is planted THROUGH

          HIS FOREHEAD!
          Doug approaches terrified.

          BEHIND HIM A WEAK AND ASTHMATIC VOICE BEGINS TO SING THE

                         NATIONAL ANTHEM-

          VOICE (O.S.)
          "Oh, say can you see, by the dawn's
          early light,
          What so proudly we hailed at the
          twilight's last gleaming?"
          Doug jumps and quickly lifts the baseball bat, ready to
          swing.
          Nobody. Just the fake living room filled with inert dummies.
          No trace of his baby. An electrical fan turns in a corner,
          close to a shelve full of old books...
          Doug moves forward, gripping the bat tightly.

          VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          (feeble and asthmatic)
          "...Whose broad stripes and bright
          stars, through the perilous
          fight..."
          He can hear his own heart beat as he searches through the
          house. In another room, close to the window and in the
          shadows, he sees someone sitting in a wheelchair.

          VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          "...And the rockets' red glare, the
          bombs bursting in air..."
          Doug gets closer-
          A ray of light shines on the skull of whoever sits in the
          wheel chair.
          The wheel chair moves forward revealing a most horrific sight-
          BIG BRAIN - We recognize the handicapped man whom we have
          seen before, bathing behind the screen. Big Brain's body is
          skeletal. He was born with a genetic disease giving him a
          head ten times bigger than his face. A head so heavy, he is
          unable to hold it up. It rests back on his chair, forcing him
          to stretch his eyes to see from side to side.
          Big Brain is maybe the most representative character of the
          damage done by nuclear fallout in this area.
          Doug threatens him with the baseball bat-

                         DOUG
          Where's my baby! Where's
          Catherine?!
          Big Brain does not answer.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
          What did you do with her?

                         BIG BRAIN

                         (MURMURING)
          ..Nothing..
          Doug is beyond his breaking point -

                         DOUG
          Where is she then? ANSWER ME!
          He raises the bat.

                         BIG BRAIN
          (weak and asthmatic)
          .I don't know where she is. I
          never leave this place...
          Big Brain moves away from the window wheeling himself to the
          couch. His hands are thin and pale, like a child's.

          IT'S BREAKFAST TIME!
          At the same moment-

          CRASH - PLUTO, THE DEFORMED BALD GIANT, PULVERIZES THE DOOR

          WITH AN AXE AND SMASHES INTO THE HOUSE!
          Like a wild animal, Pluto charges Doug, destroying everything
          in his path.
          Doug retreats in the living room, throwing the dummies at his
          assailant.
          The giant comes closer and closer.
          Dummies are chopped into pieces.
          Doug dodges away and tries to escape, using the stairs in the
          hallway but the giant grabs him by the feet and pulls him
          down...
          The axe swings through the air missing him by a hair each
          time.

          103 INT. 1950 CAR - DAY 103

          Sensing his master is in trouble, Beast jumps around inside
          the car trying to find an exit...
          The passenger window opening is too small for him to break
          out...

          104 INT. HOUSE - DAY 104

          Doug runs into another room, escaping from Pluto and his axe.
          Instinctively, he uses the first piece of furniture he can
          find, A CHEST, to block the door behind him. He looks
          desperately for an exit. No way out.
          The axe penetrates through the door. The chest won't be
          enough to hold back Pluto.
          Second axe blow- This time the axe tears up the boards of the
          door, allowing Pluto to stick his gruesome face inside.
          Seeing Doug trapped in the room, the bald giant begins to
          laugh stupidly before turning around and walking away.

                         104 CONTINUED: 104
           The house is now silent. No sign of the giant.
           With his heart pounding through his chest and the baseball
           bat in hand, Doug moves towards the half-broken door,.

          CRASH! - PLUTO EXPLODES THROUGH THE WALL, LANDING ON TOP OF

          DOUG!
          Doug loses his bat but slides away before the axe comes
          swinging down.
          Desperate, he picks up the bat and uses it as a shield. The
          axe splits it in half.
          Doug throws himself at Pluto plunging the splintered bat into
          his abdomen.
          The sharp piece of wood enters Pluto's stomach.
          Completely out of his mind, Pluto removes the piece of wood
          from his abdomen and beats Doug in the face with it, sending
          him across the room.
          Pluto lowers his head, charging Doug like a bull. Doug
          crashes into one of the walls.
          He can't even take a breath before the giant grabs him by the
          leg like a rag doll and throws him through a wall.
          Doug falls to the ground in the living room. Wounded and
          exhausted, he is also defenseless. He has lost his glasses.
          Not far away, Big Brain savors the spectacle.
          The giant walks to him spinning the axe in his hand like a
          baton.
          His foot crushes Doug's glasses on the floor.
          The axe swings through the air. Doug jumps out of the way.

                         ANOTHER SWING-

          THE AXE STRIKES INTO HIS LEFT HAND, CUTTING OFF SOME FINGERS!
          Doug stares wide eyed at his amputated fingers and screams
          with pain.
          Blood is everywhere.
          In an act of self preservation, Doug crawls under the table.

                         (CONTINUED)

          Pluto destroys it with the axe and advances to finish him
          off.
          His asymmetrical eyes stare coldly-
          Doug is at his mercy.
          Pluto slowly caresses the axe's blade on his victims throat
          and face.
          The sharp blade moves dangerously across Doug's skin. Pluto
          stops when he sees Doug holding his PHILLIPS SCREWDRIVER!
          Pluto laughs like a dumb child at the feeble weapon. Behind
          him, Big Brain joins in on the laughter-
          Disfigured by his wounds, Doug is frozen with the screwdriver
          pointed at the giant. He looks ridiculous and starts sobbing
          like a terrorized child.

                         DOUG
          Please, I'm begging you... Don't
          kill me...

                         PLUTO
          (making fun of him)
          Loook at-t hiiis fa-ace... Loook at-
          at hiiis fa-ace...
          Even the frozen faces of the test dummies seem to mock him.

                         SUDDENLY-
          Doug stops crying_instantly, it was a trick!
          He turns the screwdriver around and slams it into Pluto's
          foot.
          The screwdriver goes through the shoe nailing Pluto to the
          floor. Pluto screams in pain.
          Doug rises and moves behind him. In a swift movement, Doug
          takes the American flag from Big Bob's forehead, stabbing
          Pluto in the back of the neck!

          OLD GLORY'S STAFF COMES THROUGH HIS THROAT ON THE OTHER SIDE.
          Pluto screams again, dropping the axe.
          Outraged, Pluto tears the flag from his neck and turns to
          Doug.

          DOUG IS HOLDING THE AXE.
          The blade swings through the air and slams into Pluto's
          skull!
          Pluto's eyes freeze and his body falls to the ground, his
          skull half open. DOUG JUMPS ON TOP OF HIM. FULL OF RAGE, HE

          MUTILATES PLUTO WITH THE AXE TO THE POINT OF EXHAUSTION.
          Big Brain watches Pluto die without showing any emotion.
          Silence returns to the destroyed house.
          Doug tears off a piece of Pluto's shirt and uses it as a
          BANDAGE for his hand...
          He picks up his half broken shattered glasses on the floor
          and put them back.
          SLING! - Doug removes the bloody axe from the corpse. He
          turns to Big Brain, who backs off-

          The back door to the SUV opens, revealing Bobby and Brenda
          carrying Lynn's body inside where Ethel's body has been
          moved.
          Not far from the car and above the fishing pole, Catherine's
          shaker remains still and silent...

          106 EXT. TOWN - DAY 106

          Still imprisoned in the car, Beast barks, desperate to find a
          way out.
          A hundred yards away-
          Cyst crosses Main Street toward Big Brain's house still
          holding the shotgun.
          Through the broken door, Cyst spots Pluto in a pool of blood.
          Hatred fills his eyes as he loads the shotgun and prepares to
          shoot.

          He looks for Doug but sees no one.
          Cyst moves in between a few cars, failing to see Doug hiding
          behind one of them.
          Doug hits the man in his knee with the axe.
          HE SEVERS HALF OF HIS RIGHT LEG. Cyst screams in agony.
          In one swift move, Doug removes the axe from Cyst's kneecap
          swinging it into his back.
          Cyst falls on the ground.
          The fall pushes the axe further into his back. Cyst reaches
          for the shotgun lost in his fall.
          Doug steps on his chest and pushes slowly-
          Crack - The axe finally hits the spine, killing him
          instantly.
          Doug picks up the shotgun.

          From the broken window, Big Brain watches Doug walk away

          Lizard enters the house holding a MACHETE. The wound Lynn had
          given him before she died still bleeds through his improvised
          bandage.
          He moves to the kitchen with a limp. There, he comes face to
          face with Ruby. Behind her, the baby is wrapped inside a
          blanket on the table.
          The kitchen walls are covered with dry blood. Severed human
          remains are scattered about and hanging like slabs of meat.
          Ruby blocks his way-

          At the same time, Doug arrives at the last house on the
          street.
          He looks for his baby in every part of the house.
          Nothing but dummies.
          Doug enters a room and sees a crib.

          shadows. They smile at him kindly-

          THEIR FACES AND LITTLE BODIES ARE MONSTROUSLY DEGENERATED!
          Doug backs away terrified.

          110 INT. LIZARD'S HOUSE - DAY 110

          Lizard is about to butcher the baby on the table.
          Catherine is calm and moves slowly under the blanket.

          111 EXT. TOWN - DAY 111

          In a panic, Doug runs out of the last house screaming.

                         DOUG

          CATHERINE!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          112 INT. LIZARD'S HOUSE - DAY 112

          Lizard lifts the machete and removes the blanket-

          THE BABY HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE PIGLET STOLEN FROM THE GAS

          STATION!
          Ruby made the swap before Lizard entered the kitchen.
          The piglet runs off oinking...

                         LIZARD

          RUUUBY!
          Enraged, Lizard sticks the machete into the table.

          113 EXT. HILLS - DAY 113

          Outside, with the baby in her arms, Ruby runs as fast as she
          can.

          114 EXT. TOWN - DAY 114

          Desperate, Doug runs through the test town looking for his
          daughter.
          In an upstairs window, he sees Ruby's mother, THE OBESE
          WOMAN, swinging on a rocking chair staring back.
          Suddenly, coming from the hills, Doug hears the sound of a
          baby crying. In the distance, he spots Ruby running through
          the rocks. He runs with the shotgun in hand.

                         DOUG
          Catherine!

          115 EXT./INT. 1950 CAR - DAY 115

          Under the fake car, in between the seats, Beast finds a hole
          big enough to fit his nose.
          The animal forces his way through, scratching at the floor
          until he finally fits his body through the hole and out of
          the car.
          The dog runs down Main Street...

                         CUT TO:

          116 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 116

          Back on the trailer-

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         116 CONTINUED: 116
          Sweating, Bobby joins his sister hidden behind the SW. With
          the 9mm in hand, staring at the horizon, he is ready to face
          the enemy.
          Above the fishing pole, Catherine's shaker is still.
          Gust of wind blow on the eerily silent plains.
          Suddenly, in a flash, the fishing line tightens and THE

          SHAKER MOVES AROUND, MAKING NOISE.
          Then, quiet returns as if nothing had ever happened.
          Brenda is terrified. Maybe someone has crossed their zone of
          security.
          Bobby Lifts his head and looks a full 360Â°-

          NOTHING.
          Bobby and Brenda exchange worried glances when-

          THE FISHING POLE MOVES, SHAKING CATHERINE'S SHAKER

          FRENETICALLY.
          The fishing reel quickly unwinds...
          This time there is little room for doubt, even if all seems
          clear around the camper.

                         BRENDA
          I don't.see anybody... What's
          happening?
          Bobby and Brenda leave their hiding place. They move, back to
          back, cautious...

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
          answer me, why isn't anyone there?
          I'm scared...

                         BOBBY

                         (LOW VOICE)
          Stay close Brenda.
          From inside the SW, we see the two adolescents getting
          further away when-

          A DARK FIGURE JUMPS IN THE FOREGROUND, IN FRONT OF THE

          WINDOW!

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         116 CONTINUED: (2) 116
          It's PAPA JUPITER. His long hair and thick beard cover
          everything except his determined and PSYCHOPATHIC EYES.
          Bobby and Brenda have arrived at the end of their security
          zone...

                         BRENDA
          Look!
          Further ahead, on the ground, a tumbleweed is stuck on the
          fishing wire, moving it in the wind.

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)
          Let's go back...
          Not convinced, Bobby agrees, but his face freezes when he
          turns back to see- THE BACK DOOR OF THE SUV, WIDE OPEN.
          At a loss, Bobby and Brenda return.

          THEIR MOTHER'S BODY HAS BEEN REMOVED!

                         BRENDA (CONT'D)

                         (PANICKED)
          What happened? What happened Bobby?
          Where's mom?
          A trail of blood leads from the trailer to somewhere behind
          some rocks.

                         BOBBY

                         (TO BRENDA)
          He's over there. Get the trailer
          ready.._
          The new "visitor" has brought the nightmare back to life in
          Brenda's eyes. She's paralyzed.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Brenda? Come on?
          Brenda remains still.

                         BOBBY (CONT'D)

          BRENDA?!
          Terrorized, Brenda backs up to the trailer, while her
          brother, with a determined look on his face, walks to the
          hills.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          117 INT. TRAILER - DAY 117

          Brenda returns to the trailer where two propane tanks have
          been brought out from under the sink.
          Through the window, she watches her brother get further out.

          118 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 118

          What Bobby discovers behind the rocks is beyond horrific-
          Kneeling next to his mother's corpse, Papa Jupiter devours
          her heart, tearing into it with his teeth. FEELING BOBBY'S

          PRESENCE, HE TURNS AROUND AND STARES AT THE YOUNG MAN WITH A

          SADISTIC SMILE. BLOOD DRIPS DOWN HIS BEARD.
          Bobby points his gun at him.
          Papa Jupiter stands and, in a fit of rage, charges at Bobby.
          Keeping his cool, Bobby fires-
          BANG! BANG! BANG! The bullets only slow him down.
          CLICK! The gun is empty.

          119 INT. TRAILER - DAY 119

          Brenda opens the valves to the gas tanks.

          120 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 120

          .Outside, Bobby throws the gun and runs to the trailer as fast
          as he can. _
          Papa Jupiter is right behind him.
          He takes a SMALL PICKAXE from his belt and throws it at
          Bobby.

          THE PICKAXE STICKS INTO THE TRAILER INCHES FROM BOBBY'S FACE!

          121 INT. TRAILER - DAY 121

          Bobby enters the trailer, closing the door behind him. He
          quickly tapes matches at the bottom of the door, right above
          the striking part of the matchbox on the floor.
          Next to him, the propane flows freely.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          122 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 122

          Behind the trailer, Brenda helps her brother squeeze out of
          the back window.
          They both run and hide behind a rock.
          At the same time, Papa Jupiter stands in front of the trailer
          door, relishing the idea that his victims are inside.
          He opens the door. The matches strike-

          PAPA JUPITER IS ENGULFED IN THE FLAMES.

          THE TRAILER HOME EXPLODES!
          Protected by the rocks, Bobby and Brenda watch as the
          explosion climbs to the sky. They did it...

                         CUT TO:

          127 EXT. HILLS EDGE - DAY 127

          With Catherine held tightly in her arms, Ruby runs on the
          edge of the mountain.
          Seventy yards behind, Lizard gives chase with a limp and the
          chain of spikes in tow.

                         LIZARD
          Ruby...Ruby! You come back here
          right now. You hear me, you little
          bitch?
          The road on the edge comes to a dead end.
          Ruby is stuck, the only way out is to climb. Without using
          her hands, she attempts to ascend. It's close to impossible.

          SUDDENLY, LIZARD GRABS HER ANKLE!
          She tries to fight him off, but he is too strong.
          Ruby kicks him in the jaw enraging him more. He pulls her
          down swiftly when-

          BEAST APPEARS BEHIND RUBY!
          The animal shows his teeth, advancing towards Lizard who
          backs off.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         127 CONTINUED: 127
          Lizard is amused and almost excited with this last
          confrontation... Discreetly, he grabs the chain of spikes
          while keeping his eyes on the barking German Shepherd.

          THE RUSTY, RETRACTABLE SPIKES ARE RELEASED ALONG THE CHAIN!
          Beast sees the weapon and leaps towards Lizard.
          Too late. The chain strikes the dog in the air, sending him
          over the edge.

          BEAST WHINES AS HE LANDS ON A PROTRUDING SECTION OF THE

          RAVINE A FEW FEET FURTHER DOWN...
          Ruby refuses to hand over the baby, holding it tightly to her
          chest.

                         LIZARD (CONT'D)
          Give me that baby, Ruby!
          With no time to react, Lizard is brutally struck in the face
          with the shotgun butt-

          DOUG IS BACK!
          Taking no chances and screaming like a wild beast, Doug beats
          Lizard repeatedly pushing him away from the baby.
          With a bloodied face, Lizard can hardly stand.
          Doug turns the weapon around and-
          BANG! - He shoots Lizard in the chest.
          Lizard is thrown back with the force.
          Doug reloads still screaming-
          BANG! Lizard is hit in the throat and falls.to his knees.
          Blood sprays everywhere.
          Doug reloads again-
          BANG! - hit in the shoulder, Lizard falls back in the dirt.
          His face slams into the dust.
          Exhausted, Doug walks over to his adversary.
          He is dead.
          Disfigured with wounds, Doug turns to Ruby, who extends the
          baby.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         127 CONTINUED: (2)
          Doug can barely comprehend it - the nightmare is finally
          over!
          He. drops the smoking gun and opens his arms to embrace his
          baby. He cries tears of joy as he holds Catherine close to
          him.

                         DOUG
          My baby ...My little princess... It's
          me, it's daddy...
          He kisses the baby and hugs her tightly, elated. Ruby is
          moved. She smiles when suddenly her face freezes-

          LIZARD STANDS FIFTEEN FEET BEHIND, HOLDING THE SHOTGUN!
          Trembling, he lifts the weapon towards Doug and the baby.
          Instinctively, Ruby moves to stop him.
          KA-CHUNK! - Lizard reloads.
          His finger squeezes the trigger.

          BANG!
          At the last second, Ruby jumps on Lizard changing the
          direction of the blast.
          They both fall off the mountain into the emptiness. Their
          bodies plunge a hundred feet down, splattering on the rocks
          below.

          RUBY HAS SACRIFICED HER OWN LIFE TO SAVE DOUG AND THE BABY.

          130 EXT. TRAILER - DAY 130

          One of the FAMILY PHOTOS of the carters posing with their
          dogs is slowly burning away in the flames.
          Pieces of the trailer still burn in the middle of the desert.
          Surrounded by debris, Papa Jupiter's body is impaled.on a
          darkened metal siding. Still alive but entirely burnt, his
          skin is raw and unrecognizable. With every breath, blood
          spits from his mouth...
          Facing this post atomic creature, Bobby hesitates to take it
          out of its misery. Brenda comes to his side-

                         (CONTINUED)

                         BRENDA
          Come on, Bobby. Let's get out of
          here...
          Bobby's face has changed. He is no longer the innocent kid of
          just a few hours ago. His eyes are now filled with rage and a
          determination to survive and succeed no matter what.
          Brenda and Bobby walk away from the burning trailer. On the
          other side of the smoke, they see-

          DOUG WALKING BACK WITH THE BABY, BEAST LIMPING AT HIS SIDE.
          Exhausted, wounded, disfigured, but still alive.

          131 EXT. HILLS - DAY 131

          From a distance, next to the fiery trailer, we see Doug,
          Brenda, and Bobby gathered around the baby. Reunited again.

          FROM THE SUMMIT OF THE HILLS, SOMEONE OBSERVES THEM WITH

          BINOCULARS.

                         THE END
The Hollow Man


				written by Andrew W. Marlowe
								  Red Wagon 
Prods. 
								Revised Draft 
6/26/98

	FADE IN:
	On complete darkness.
	A SMALL DOOR swings open.
	A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the 
	length of a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a 
	gloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the 
	frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind 
	it. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to 
	pad down the tube s length.
	After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit 
	cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops.
	The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s 
	ears.
	The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a 
	door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle.
	The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING.
	The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, 
	but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on 
	the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and 
	dashes toward it.
	But an invisible force descends.
	The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its 
	body, crushing it.
	A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air, 
	halting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes, 
	struggling against the unholy force.
	Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life 
	quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes...
	The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white 
	fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood.
	HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked 
	ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into 
	the rat.
									
	CUT TO:
	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
	In the background we hear Jay Leno s monologue from the 
	Tonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer 
	screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with 
	the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry 
	framed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips 
	coffee from an  Einstein  coffee mug. He peers at a 
	complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his 
	screen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts 
	slightly, then falls apart.
	Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the 
	cellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard 
	with renewed vigor.
	Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s 
	fingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on 
	and off, it trembles and twists apart.
				SEBASTIAN
			Damnit.
	Sebastian pears out his window. Across the courtyard, a 
	light comes on in a neighboring window. He sees a 
	BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her 
	living room. The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses 
	it and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to 
	the window, getting interested. But when the brunette 
	reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window 
	and lowers her shades.
				SEBASTIAN (cont d)
			Damnit.
	Sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. 
	He s obviously tired. He opens his eyes and stares up at 
	the ceiling. Painted across the white matte finish in big 
	red letters is a brief reminder -  You Should Be 
	Working.  Sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins 
	pecking away again.
										 
LATER:
	The television is now only static. We pan by his alarm 
	clock. 4 am. We find Sebastian pacing in front of his 
	computer.
	He gets an idea... slides back in his chair. Types away 
	again. The molecule reforms on the computer screen.
	He types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule. 
	Nothing happens.
	He hits a few more keys and watches intently for a 
	reaction.
				SEBASTIAN
				 (beat)
			I am a goddamn genius.
	He hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on 
	the screen. He dials.
									
	CUT TO:
	INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT
	Digital phone rings.
	In the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a 
	deep sleep. As she straggles out of bed and over to her 
	desk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her.
	The ringing continues. She moves her computer mouse 
	around and her screen comes to life. She click on a 
	telephone icon and the ringing stops. A beat later, 
	Sebastian appears in a window on her screen.
				LINDA
			Sebastian, do you know what time it 
			is?
				SEBASTIAN (SCREEN)
			You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it 
			was waste of time.
				LINDA
			What is it this time?
	INTERCUT: SEBASTIAN S BEDROOM
	Sebastian peers at the image of Linda in the computer 
	window. He notices something behind her in the bed, the 
	young man sleeping face down.
				SEBASTIAN
			Who s that?
	Linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer 
	screen and positions it so Sebastian can t see the bed.
				LINDA
			Not your business. Not anymore.
				SEBASTIAN
			Touche.
				LINDA
			So you calling about anything in 
			particular, or were you just hoping to 
			catch me sleeping in the nude?
				SEBASTIAN
			I cracked the reversion.
	Upon hearing this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline.
				LINDA
			You cracked it?
				SEBASTIAN
			Look at this. 
	Sebastian hits a couple of keys. A moment later the 
	molecular structure appears on Linda s computer.
				SEBASTIAN
			Watch this.
				LINDA
			You sure?
				SEBASTIAN
			91% sure.
				LINDA
				 (astonished)
			Eleven months with no progress and you 
			suddenly come up with it out of the 
			blue? How?
				SEBASTIAN
			The usual. Coffee and twinkies.
				LINDA
			I hate you.
				SEBASTIAN
			I know. You think you could hunt down 
			Matt and get to the lab early. I want 
			Isabelle prepped for a live test.
				LINDA
			Yeah, I think I can find him. What are 
			you going to do?
				SEBASTIAN
			Well y know. It s daylight in 
			Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel
			Committee and tell them to get our
			prizes ready. See you in a few.
	ON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian clicks off. Linda 
	crosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake.
				LINDA
			Hey... come on.
	DR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late 20s too, stirs from under 
	sheets.
				MATT
				 (groggy)
			What?
				LINDA
			Sebastian just called. We gotta get to 
			the lab.
	Matt bolts up.
				MATT
			Shit! You didn t tell him I was here, 
			did you?
				LINDA
			Give me some credit, will ya.
				MATT
			So what s the rush?
				LINDA
			He cracked reversion.
	Matt pulls his jeans on.
				MATT
			Wanna ride down?
				LINDA
			We better take our own cars.
				MATT
			You re gonna have to tell him about us 
			eventually.
				LINDA
			I know. It s just You re his best 
			friend. He ll feel betrayed.
	EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. SKYLINE - DAY
	From a distance, the Nation s Monuments stand awash in 
	the harsh light of morning.
	CAMERA finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security 
	fence of a warehouse. The imposing structure is 
	surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire.
	The Porsche is waved through security and heads straight 
	into the warehouse.
	INT. WAREHOUSE -DAY
	The Porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space 
	and Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, 
	and Birkenstocks. He notes the other cars parked in the 
	lot, then crosses to bunker in the center of the 
	warehouse, guarded by a MARINE, shouldering an M-16.
				MARINE GUARD
			Morning, sir.
				SEBASTIAN
			Morning, Ed.
				MARINE GUARD
			Your team s in early. Something 
			special going on?
				SEBASTIAN
			Sorry, Ed. You know the rules. 
	Sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen. A 
	laser reads his print. 
	Scan readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN 
	Clearance:    ALPHA ALPHA THREE 
	Division:	CLASSIFIED 
	The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside.
				MARINE GUARD
			Have a good day, sir.
	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
	Inside the elevator is a numberless keypad. Sebastian 
	taps in his floor code.
				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization please.
				SEBASTIAN
			Caine zero zero two seven.
				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization verified. Good morning, 
			Dr. Caine. 
	The elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes 
	below us and keeps descending into the belly of the 
	earth, the shaft goes down forever.
	INT. HABITAT S CORRIDOR
	We slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas 
	chambers. Each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a 
	specific animal, although no animals are visible.
	As we pass one habitat, something slams into the 
	Plexiglas and begins barking. Another HOWL joins in. Then 
	SCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen 
	animal cries. THUMP.
	THUMP.
	The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry 
	animals were slamming against it. But still, no animals 
	are seen.
	Above each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES 
	revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but 
	they remain invisible to the naked eye. MATT taps on a 
	sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly 
	empty cage.
				MATT
			Isabelle ...
	The woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the 
	Plexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face. The 
	Plexiglas begins to shake violently.
				MATT (cont d)
			Calm down baby. Calm down. It s 
			okay...
	Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and 
	pulls them down over his eyes. 
	THERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature, ape-like in 
	shape, rattles about the cage. Matt slowly unlatches the 
	Plexiglas door and reaches inside.
				MATT (cont d)
			It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m not 
			going to hurt you. Come here.
	THERMAL POV - he reaches out to the creature. He grabs 
	hold of it, firmly. Stroking it. The creature COOS. Matt 
	reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature.
				MATT (cont d)
			Just hold still. 
	Something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. 
	Blood erupts in a bite pattern.
				MATT (cont d)
			 Ow, shit.
	Matt drops the hypo and falls back. The cage door flies 
	open and something runs out. Matt pulls himself up to see 
	the heat signature running down the hallway. He turns 
	around to see another heat signature coming at him. Matt 
	pulls off his goggles to see Linda coming up the 
	Corridor.
				LINDA
			You okay?
				MATT
			She bit me.
				LINDA
			Yeah. She s become a lot more 
			aggressive in the last few days.
	Linda takes the goggles from Matt.
				LINDA (cont d)
			Go take care of that bite. I ll get 
			her.
				MATT
			And give you a chance to pull ahead? 
			Never.
	Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and 
	pulls out a two tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt.
	AROUND THE CORNER
	A slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. 
	We hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS.
	Looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a 
	haunting heavy breathing. The control door is closed 
	though and something large and angry is throwing itself 
	against it. We can t see anything.
	A few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner, 
	wearing goggles and leveling their pistols.
				MATT
				 (ala Porky)
			Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting 
			simians.   heheheheh.
				LINDA
			Knock it off.
				 (soothing voice)
			Isabelle!
	THERMAL POV - Dark hallway. Movement. A red shimmering 
	heat signature. It comes running at Linda. HOWLING. Linda 
	fires. A T-DART flies. Thwack... It stops in mid-air. 
	Then falls. But it doesn t hit the floor. Instead, it 
	stops inches above the ground. 
	THERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap at 
	Linda s feet.
				MATT
			Good shootin , Tex.
				LINDA
			What s that make it?
				MATT
			I m still ahead. 6 to 5.
	Like a smug gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from 
	the top of her tranquilizer gun.
				LINDA
			But I m catching up.
	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
	The elevator doors open and Sebastian steps out. He s met 
	by SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, a fiery red-head.
				SARAH
			Can I have a word?
				SEBASTIAN
			Most normal people say good morning.
				SARAH
			Don t you think you should test the 
			protocol on the liver samples before 
			you inject Isabelle?
				SEBASTIAN
			How many tissue samples have we 
			successfully regressed? Hundreds, 
			right? How many have gone on to work 
			on the full system? None.
				SARAH
			That s beside the point.
				SEBASTIAN
			No, that is the point. I m not going 
			to waste six months of my life on an 
			outmoded testing procedure. This thing 
			works. I know it. I feel it.
	Linda comes down the corridor, listening in on the tail 
	end of the conversation.
				SARAH
			Fine. You can mop up afterward.
				SEBASTIAN
			You think I m going to kill Isabelle?
				SARAH
			Kill? More like liquefy.
				SEBASTIAN
			Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but 
			I m the project leader. Understand? 
	She says ...
				SARAH
			Yes, Sir.
	... but somehow it feels like  Fuck you.  She storms off. 
	Sebastian turns to Linda.
				SEBASTIAN
			How did you ever convince me to hire 
			her?
				LINDA
			You said you wanted the beat vet in 
			the country.
				SEBASTIAN
			Yeah, well she cares more about the 
			animals than the research.
				LINDA
			Maybe that s why she s so good.
									
	CUT TO:
	CLOSE ON: MATT as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron. As 
	it s spinning slows to a halt, he pops the top and 
	reaches in, removing...
	A GLOWING VIAL OF ORANGE LIQUID.
	Sebastian peers at the vial.
				SEBASTIAN
			Who da Man? You da Man.
				MATT
			As we pull out we see we are.
	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
	Almost feels like a dungeon. Think high-tech 
	Frankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical 
	readouts, bizarre medical equipment.
	On a table in the middle of the room, a sheet drapes over 
	a humanoid form, strapped down at it s invisible limbs. 
	The straps move slightly... ghostly. Wires lead from the 
	body to lots of machinery.
				MATT
			Protocol is hot.
				SEBASTIAN
			Vitals?
	Sarah, checks over the various readouts ... heartbeat, 
	blood pressure, the rest.
				SARAH
			Normal.
	CARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab assistant, wheels in 
	a cart of equipment. Linda taken a seat by the table and 
	pushes aside the sheet.
				BOOMING VOICE
			THIS IS GOD. YOU ARE DISTURBING THE
			NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS AND WILL BE
			SEVERELY PUNISHED FOR ALL ETERNITY.
			GOD HAS SPOKEN.
				SEBASTIAN
			How many times do I have to tell you, 
			Frank you aren t God.
				 (beat)
			I am.
				FRANK (LOUDSPEAKER)
			Sorry, Boss. Forgot.
	Sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the 
	Laboratory floor. TWO PEOPLE in the booth.
				SEBASTIAN
			You guys ready to roll?
	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
	FRANK CHASE, early thirties, and tech expert JANICE 
	WALTON, early twenties, man a small booth above the lab. 
	They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists.
	The room is crammed with electronic and recording 
	equipment. A handful of monitors display different images 
	of the lab. Thermal and regular video. Another screen 
	monitors vital signs.
				FRANK
			We are live and in color. On your 
			mark.
	Frank and Janice looks down on their colleagues. 
	Sebastian nods their way.
				SEBASTIAN
			Okay. Roll  em.
				JANICE
			Okay. We are rolling record on videos 
			one through twelve.
	Frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a 
	microphone. Recording.
	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
	Frank s voice echoes through the chamber.
				FRANK (V.O.)
			Subject Isabelle Two. Currently in 
			phase shift... one hundred twenty six 
			days, eighteen hours.
				LINDA
			Testing De-Phase protocol. Injecting 
			serial protein Caine One Two Five. 
	Linda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a 
	centrifuge nearby.
				MATT
			Maybe if you stopped naming them after 
			yourself, you d have better luck.
				SEBASTIAN
			Why thank you, Dr. Kensington, for 
			that keen scientific observation. I ll 
			be sure to include it in my memoirs.
				MATT
			A whole mention? And I thought I was 
			just gonna be a footnote.
	Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into 
	the vial, drawing up the colored liquid.
	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
				MATT
			Okay.
	Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s vitals.
	INT. LABORATORY - DAY
	Tension in the air.
				SEBASTIAN
				 (to Linda)
			Ready.
	She wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it 
	tight. She then takes some dye and sprays it. A surface 
	appears, floating beneath the restraints. It sheens in 
	the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps the 
	surface several times. A small bulge appears, like a 
	vein.
				LINDA
			Propped.
				MATT
			Let s make some history.
	Matt lowers the hypo to the vein. But Sebastian takes the 
	hypo from Matt s hand.
				SEBASTIAN
			Nice try, Sparky.
	Matt relinquishes the needle.
				LINDA
			Come on, Isabelle. You can do this. 
	Sebastian lowers the hypo. The skin bonds and gives. The 
	needle remains in sight after it slips through the 
	visible surface. Matt presses down on the hypo plunger, 
	releasing a dye into his bloodstream. The gold liquid 
	twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb. 
	It s the shape of a vein. The liquid begins to react. 
	Small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of 
	color. Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed 
	up.
				SARAH
			Elevated heartbeat.
	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH
	Janice analyzes the screens.
				JANICE
			We re still in the green.
				FRANK
			Confirmed. Vitals still in the normal 
			range.
	INT. LABORATORY
	The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex 
	webbing of a bloodstream appears.
				MATT
			It s reacting.
	Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes 
	visible.. the shadow of a skeletal system.
				SEBASTIAN
			Do you see this?
				LINDA
			It s working. It s actually working. 
	Matt pulls the sheet back. Muscles are beginning to 
	appear. And eyeballs. Frightened eyeballs.
				SARAH
			Heart rate s up. She s scared.
	Sarah soothes her.
				SARAH (cont d)
			It's okay, baby. It's okay.
				SEBASTIAN
			Subject began manifesting almost 
			Immediately. Protocol is reacting 
			quickly.
	Isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints. She 
	begins to howl.
				LINDA
			Subject may be in pain or extreme 
			discomfort.
				SARAH
			Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating. 
			Brain activity going through the roof. 
	The brain appears, seemingly growing from the inside out. 
	The shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from the 
	inside out. A SKULL APPEARS howling in pain, in horror.
				SARAH (cont d)
			We ve got a problem.
				SEBASTIAN
			What? What problem!
	Sarah checks her monitors.
				SARAH
			It s her heart. We can see the heart 
			beating in the ape s
				FRANK (V.0.)
			I got an erratic heart beat.
				SARAH
			She s going into cardiac arrest.
				LINDA
			Got the crash cart.
	Carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in.
				SARAH
			We re losing her.
	Her machine flatlines.
				SEBASTIAN
			No! It s got to work.
	The body is only half there. It looks as if its caught in 
	decomposition. Linda rubs the cardiac paddles together.
				LINDA
			Clear!
	Linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest. The jolt 
	of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief 
	moment. Then the skin and flesh fade away again.
				SARAH
			We ve got something!
	The heartbeat starts up again. The body continues its 
	march toward,visibility.
				SARAH (cont d)
			Still. erratic.
				LINDA
			Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do 
			it. You can fucking do it.
	Everybody s pulling for her.
				SARAH
			Come on, monkey.
				MATT
			Do it. Do it. Come on.
	Muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists 
	and turns, frightened. Then skin. The monkey howls. Skin 
	forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being 
	painted on before our eyes.
				SARAH
			Stabilizing.
	The entire form glows, then blinks, then glows again, as 
	if it was discharging some stored energy.
				FRANK (V.0.)
			Brain activity returning to normal.
	The monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda 
	hovers over it stroking its fur.
				LINDA
			Welcome back, Isabelle.
	Sebastian puts his hand on Linda s shoulder... a move 
	that does not go unnoticed by Matt. We did it.
				SEBASTIAN
				 (beat)
			How is she?
				SARAH
				 (surprised)
			I think she s gonna be okay
								
	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HABITAT

	Frank, Matt, Sarah, Janice and Linda watch Isabelle rise 
	and walk about the cage. She goes over to the other 
	monkeys and joins in their grooming rituals.

				CARTER
			Amazing. She's normal, absolutely 
			healthy. If you didn't know any 
			better, you'd think nothing had 
			happened to her.

				MATT
				 (ribbing Sarah)
			Yeah. I can't wait to slice up her 
			brain and trace her neural pathways.

				SARAH
			Screw you, Matt.

				MATT
			Well maybe not right away.

				LINDA
			We should celebrate.

	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	The fanciest one in D.C.

	The entire eight person team sits around a round table, 
	drunk and laughing, as the last champagne flute is 
	filled.

	Sebastian raises his glass.

				SEBASTIAN
			To the finest research team I've ever 
			known.

	A round of "Hear, hears" and they all clink glasses and 
	drink.

	EXT. RESTAURANT BALCONY - LATER

	The din of the diners fades away as Linda slips out onto 
	the restaurant's balcony. She find Sebastian leaning 
	against a railing, breathing in the night air.

				SEBASTIAN
			Hey...

				LINDA
			I thought you'd gone.

				SEBASTIAN
			Where would I go?

	He looks out over the sweep of the city, the twinkling 
	lights of D.C. and darkness of the Potomac river.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Twenty years ago there were no 
			computers, no fax machines, no cell 
			phones. I was just wondering what the 
			world will be like twenty years from 
			now... if what we're doing will change 
			everything.

				LINDA
			A little "I am become death... the 
			shatterer of worlds"?

				SEBASTIAN
			Something like that.

				LINDA
			Since the day I met, all you wanted to 
			do was change the world.

	She puts her hand on his shoulder.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Listen, I know we've... I mean... well 
			... I just want you to know how proud 
			I am of you. I know it probably 
			doesn't mean a lot...

				SEBASTIAN
			Actually it does.
				 (beat)
			I guess since you were there from the 
			beginning, you know me better than 
			anyone else on this godforsaken 
			planet.

				LINDA
			You're positively maudlin. You should 
			be happy. Do you have any idea what 
			you've accomplished?

				SEBASTIAN
			Yeah... but I was working so hard, I 
			didn't realize I'd have no one to 
			share it with.

	Sebastian heads back inside. But he stops and turns back.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			I don't suppose we could turn back the 
			clock for a night and you could come 
			home with me?

	Her look says it all. Too much water under the bridge.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Right. Sorry. Too much champagne.

	He turns and heads back into the party. As he heads in he 
	passes Matt heading out. He and Sebastian exchange 
	"Heys".

				MATT
			What was that about?

				LINDA
			Nothing. It's just... He is who he is. 
			Sometimes I just have to be reminded.

									
	CUT TO:

	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

	Sebastian wanders through the empty hallways of the 
	laboratory.

	INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

	Sebastian paces back and forth, examining the habitats. 
	He taps on the Plexiglas of one. The cubicle explodes 
	with

	BARKING.

	We see the Plexi steam up in one part, as if something 
	was breathing on it. As if a nose were pressed against 
	it.

				SEBASTIAN
				 (a little drunk)
			What's it like? Talk goddamnit! Tell 
			me what it's like!

								
	DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. PENTAGON - DAY

	Flying over Washington D. C. , we cross the Potomac and 
	circle the five-cornered building, looking particularly 
	gloomy on this grey day.

				SEBASTIAN (V.0.)
			Six years ago, this committee 
			commissioned me with a very specific 
			task...

	INT. PENTAGON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

	At the table are six men. A handful of senior military 
	brass and top civilian advisors direct their attention to 
	the front of the room, where Sebastian, flanked by Matt 
	and Linda, is in the middle of his presentation.

				SEBASTIAN
			To successful phase-shift a human 
			being out of quantum sync with the 
			visible universe and then return him 
			safely, with no after affects.

	Next to Sebastian a video shows a small monkey shifting 
	from the visible spectrum. It's hair, skin, organs and 
	skeletons slowly dissolve before our eyes.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Well, we found out sending them to 
			"never-never-land" was easy, it's the 
			getting back that's hard.

	Sebastian fast forwards a few moments until the video 
	screen shows the bizarrely tangled heap of flesh and bone 
	that used to be alive.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Every time we've tried to bring a test 
			subject back from phase-shift. 
			Cellular bonds would dissolve, the 
			primary DNA strands would decay. But 
			now...

	Sebastian pauses. Something's bothering him.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			But now...

	One of the senior advisers, DR. HARRY KRAMER, 
	distinguished 50s, finally breaks the silence.

				KRAMER
			But now?

	Linda and Matt look up at Sebastian expectantly.

				SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
			But now...
				 (pause)
			But now, we feel we are closer than 
			ever to resolving this issue. We've 
			been experimenting with a new 
			regression formula that looks rather 
			promising.
			A FOUR STAR GENERAL leans forward.

				GENERAL
			How long?

				SEBASTIAN
			Sir?

				GENERAL
			Son, as you can imagine, we are very 
			anxious to field test this tactical 
			asset. How long till you resolve this 
			issue?

	Linda starts to speak, but Sebastian cuts her off with a 
	look.

				SEBASTIAN
			Shouldn't be more than another year, 
			Sir.

	Frustrated sighs all around the room.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Maybe sooner.

	EXT. PENTAGON - DAY

	As Linda, Matt and Sebastian head to their cars.

				MATT
			Yo. Reality check! What the hell was 
			that about?

				SEBASTIAN
			Keep your voice down.

				MATT
			The protocol works. Why'd you tell 
			them it didn't?

				SEBASTIAN
			I wasn't ready for them to know.

				MATT
			But they're the oversight committee. 
			They're supposed to know.

				LINDA
			I'm sure he had a reason.
				 (firmly)
			You did have a reason, didn't you, 
			Sebastian?

				SEBASTIAN
			I had more than a reason. I had a 
			goddamn epiphany.

	They reach his Porsche.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			What do you think they'd do if they 
			know we could send a subject into 
			phase shift and pull it back out 
			again? How many seconds would it take 
			for them to take over the whole 
			project, bringing in their soldiers to 
			test the formula on. We'd have lost 
			control of it by the end of the week.

				LINDA
			It's their money, Sebastian. It's 
			going to happen eventually.

				SEBASTIAN
			I know. But not yet. There's too much 
			for us to learn. I don't want my hands 
			tied by their political agenda when we 
			go to phase three.

				MATT
			Well, then... mind telling us how 
			you're gonna get a human test-subject 
			for phase three without the committee 
			finding out?

				SEBASTIAN
			That's easy. I've decided to test the 
			procedure ...

	INT. LABORATORY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

				SEBASTIAN
			... on myself.

	The team sits around the conference table. Their jaws 
	drop and they stare at him with wide eyes.

				FRANK
			Are you nuts?

				SEBASTIAN
			Was Jonas Salk nuts?

				FRANK
			Yeah. Pretty sure he was.

				CARTER
			And remember, for every Jonas Salk, 
			there are a bunch of guys who aren't 
			famous cuz they died.

				SEBASTIAN
			If we're that unsure, how can we 
			morally justify testing it on someone 
			else?

				JANICE
			Isn't it a little soon to be moving 
			into phase three anyway?

				SARAH
			She's right. We haven't even finished 
			collating the phase two research.

				SEBASTIAN
			We'll have plenty of time to collate 
			and cross-reference later. Monkey data 
			doesn't matter anyway. The only real 
			data is human data.

				SARAH
			You don't even know if any of the 
			protocols will work on humans.

				SEBASTIAN
			How are we gonna find out? Besides, 
			we've succeeded with a gorilla and 
			their DNA is 98% the same as humans. 
			And the 2% is not that significant.

				LINDA
			Sebastian ... humans can talk, build 
			houses and cook in microwave ovens. 
			Gorilla's live in trees. That's a 
			helluva 2% if you ask me.

				SEBASTIAN
			We're all concerned. I know that. But 
			if we're gonna move forward ever, this 
			is something we have to do.

				LINDA
			Why you? Why not one of us?

				SEBASTIAN
			The risks. I couldn't ask...

				MATT
				 (interrupting)
			What if we volunteer?

				LINDA
			What if you're too valuable to lose?

				SEBASTIAN
			I'm Project Leader. It's my formula 
			and my call. The best way to express 
			your concern is to make damn sure you 
			do your best work. I'll want about 
			four weeks to...

				FRANK
			To put your affairs in order?

				SEBASTIAN
			To run some more reversions and tissue 
			tests and then we'll attempt the phase 
			shift. I'll stay shifted for three 
			days of testing and then we'll perform 
			a quantum regression.

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

	A knock on the door.

				SEBASTIAN
			Come in.

	Linda pushes into the room and closes the door behind 
	her.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			What?

				LINDA
			In the past six years, I've never once 
			challenged your decisions, but this 
			... Sebastian. I don't think you 
			should do this.

				SEBASTIAN
			You don't understand.

				LINDA
			Oh please. How long were we together? 
			You must've said it a million times 
			... Nobody knows who built the lunar 
			lander. All they remember in the first 
			man on the moon.

	Sebastian shrugs and nods.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			But what if something happens to 
			you... what about the project? 

	Sebastian smiles.

				SEBASTIAN
			Lin, trust me... nothing's going to 
			happen.

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Linda and Matt are in bed together. Matt kisses her way 
	up and down her arm. But Linda is distracted.

				LINDA
			He refuses to listen to reason.

				MATT
			Can we talk about this later? I'm 
			trying to make love to you.

				LINDA
			Sorry. I just can't let it go.

	Matt props himself up on the pillow.

				MATT
			I know how you're feeling. Hell, he 
			and I've been friends since freshman 
			year.

				LINDA
			So how can we let him do this?

				MATT
			What if you were given the opportunity 
			to be the first person on ,Mars, would 
			you go?

				LINDA
			In a heartbeat.

				MATT
			What if they didn't know whether or 
			not they could get you home?

	Linda thinks about it. It's still tempting.

				MATT (cont'd)
			This is his chance to be Chuck Yeager 
			or Christopher Columbus. Well, if I 
			were him I'd do the same thing.

	Matt goes back to kissing Linda.

				LINDA
			Let me ask another question.

				MATT
			Is about who gets to be on top?

				LINDA
			Is the human race really ready for 
			what we're doing?

	Matt groans and rolls over.

				MATT
			Why do you always get philosophical 
			before we're about to get physical?

				LINDA
			No really. Is it ready? We're 
			barrelling down a road that begs moral 
			and ethical questions that I don't 
			think we can answer.

				MATT
			They said the same thing about the 
			bomb. They said we'd never survive the 
			nuclear age... but here we are.

				LINDA
			This night is still young.
				 (beat)
			I mean, when you think about it, it's 
			creepy. Do we really want to live in a 
			world where people can just disappear 
			in the blink of an eye?

				MATT
			We made our deal with the devil years 
			ago. Might as well stick around to 
			cash in.

	INT. MEDICAL EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

	Sebastian stripped to his shorts paces nervously. A knock 
	on the door.

				SEBASTIAN
				 (his voice catches)
			Yes?

	Matt sticks his head in.

				MATT
			We're ready.

	Sebastian nervously shakes his limbs out. Then nods.

				SEBASTIAN
			Okay.

				MATT
			It's not too late to back out. I'm 
			happy to take your place.

				SEBASTIAN
			No. I'm ready.

	Matt leads him into the hallway.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	As they walk down the corridor toward the lab...

				MATT
			Nervous?

				SEBASTIAN
			A little.

				MATT
			Ever tell you the one about Superman 
			and Wonder Woman?

				SEBASTIAN
			I don't think so.

				MATT
			So Superman's flying around the city, 
			and he's horny as hell.  Lo and behold 
			he looks down and sees Wonder Woman, 
			completely nude, sunning herself up on 
			the roof of the Justice League. I mean 
			she is lying there naked and spread 
			eagle. So Superman starts thinking, 
			"man... this is too easy. I could go 
			down there, do a little fast pumping 
			and be gone before she even sees me." 
			After all he is faster than a speeding 
			bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down, 
			takes care of business so quick, you 
			can't even see him. Well ... I tell 
			ya. Wonder Woman looks up, surprised 
			as hell and says "What the hell was 
			that." And the Invisible Man replies 
			"I dunno know, but it sure hurt like 
			hell."

	INT. LABORATORY

	Sebastian shoots Matt a look.

				SEBASTIAN
			You know, that could be the last joke 
			I ever hear.

				MATT
			C'mon, man. That's funny shit.

	The buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified 
	HEARTBEAT, thumping its familiar rhythm. Bah-bump. 
	Bah-bump. In the center of the room, Sebastian, dressed 
	only in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table 
	inclined at a 45 degree angle. Electrodes are strapped to 
	his body. An I.V. tube snakes from the needle in his vein 
	up to a bag of saline solution. Dripping slowly. Linda 
	makes last minute checks of some of the equipment. She 
	pats Sebastian on the shoulder.

				LINDA
			O.K. How're you feeling?
			
			Sebastian takes a deep breath.

				SEBASTIAN
			Fine.

	Sarah checks his vitals.

				SARAH
			Pulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit 
			elevated.

				SEBASTIAN
			To be expected.

				SARAH
			No reason for concern. He's ready. 

	Linda takes a moment and studies Sebastian's face. She's 
	almost teary eyed.

				SEBASTIAN
			Hey... it's gonna be okay.

	Linda nods. Back to business.

				LINDA
			Start recording.

	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH.

	Janice hits record on the equipment decks.

				JANICE
			We're hot. All systems nominal, 
			Houston.

	Frank coordinates all the data being fed into the 
	computers. He pushes a series of buttons and speaks into 
	a microphone.

				FRANK
			Okay, kids. Let's make some history.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Frank's voice echoes through the chamber.

				LINDA
			Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs. 

	Matt jabs a hypodermic into small vial of colored liquid. 
	Draws up 20ccs.

				MATT
				 (to Linda)
			Ready.

	Linda takes the hypo from Matt.

				MATT (cont'd)
			If the tests are any indication it 
			should work quickly.

				SEBASTIAN
			I'll inject myself. If anything goes 
			wrong, they can't blame you.

	She hands the hypo Sebastian and steps away. Sebastian 
	stares at the golden formula silently for a moment.

				LINDA
			We can still shut down, Sebastian.

	He shakes his head.

				MATT
			Any last words?

				SEBASTIAN
			Yeah. If I'm killed, pretend I said 
			something deep and clever. 

	Then... Back to business. He inserts the needle into the 
	I.V. Sebastian. Presses into himself and depresses the 
	plunger.

				LINDA
			Injection was administered at
				 (checks watch)
			... 18:23:47.

	The colored liquid snakes it's way into his bloodstream.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Keep talking. Tell us what you're 
			feeling.

				SEBASTIAN
			Nothing so far.

				SARAH
			Vitals are stable.

	They wait and watch.

				LINDA
			Nothing's happening.

	Another moment passes by.

				MATT
			Human DNA structure is slightly more 
			complex... it's possible that it may 
			take more time...

	Another moment passes.

				LINDA
			Maybe we overlooked something.

				SEBASTIAN
			Recheck the protocol. It can't be non- 
			reactive.

				CARTER
			Kinda like a firecracker with a bad 
			fuse...

	Sebastian shoots Carter a questioning look.

				CARTER (cont'd)
			Don't know if it'll go off.

				LINDA
			Frank?

				FRANK (V.0.)
				 (from the booth)
			No change in bio-electric.

				SEBASTIAN
			Goddammit.

	Another long pause. Sebastian concentrates.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Okay wait, my arm... it's getting a 
			bit warm... yeah, it's ... it's 
			starting to tingle...

	Excitement overtakes the room.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Okay... it's spreading to my back... 
			like, like a fever...

				LINDA
			Here we go.

	Slowly the flesh on Sebastian's arm begins dissolving, 
	revealing the complex network of nerves, blood vessels 
	and flesh beneath it.

				SEBASTIAN
			Shit... it's starting to burn... Oh 
			god. It hurts. I didn't think it would 
			hurt.

	The HEART BEAT thumps faster, accelerating

				SARAH
			Heartbeat's elevated. Pulse at 100.
			... 130 ...

				LINDA
			What do you feel? Keep talking. KEEP 
			TALKING!

				SEBASTIAN
			Pain!

				SARAH
			Pulse is 165 ... 170 Blood pressure 
			180 over 100. ... 

				CARTER
			He's going to blow out his heart.

				LINDA
			Prop the crash cart.

	Carter grabs the crash cart, rolls it in. Matt tears off 
	the I.V. leads into Sebastian's arms.

				MATT
			We've got to stop it!

				LINDA
			We can't!

	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH

	All the monitors are going crazy.

				JANICE
			Something's happening.

	Frank leans into the microphone.

				FRANK
			Listen up! Electric activity 
			increasing in all limbs. Brainwaves 
			are through the roof.

				JANICE
			I didn't think the human brain could 
			spike that high.

				FRANK
			Maybe it can't.

	INT. LABORATORY

	Sebastian screams in dire pain. He struggles against his 
	restraints as his skin liquefies into a muscular mass. 
	It's like something's eating away at him. Gruesome. The 
	yells become louder and more painful to hear.

				SEBASTIAN
			No. Oh god! NO! STOP IT! STOP IT!

	The muscular system begins to dissolve, leaving a 
	struggling skeleton wrapped with tentacular blood vessels 
	and stuffed with the major organs. The beating heart, the 
	heaving lungs.

				SARAH
			Pulse is 180 .... holding stable. 

	Screaming.... Then the organs go. Then the blood vessels. 
	Leaving only a skeleton howling in pain. The jawbones 
	spread wide ... Screaming... screaming...

				CARTER
			 Holy shit.

	Then as if someone had poured acid all over the bones, 
	the skeleton evaporates into nothingness.

				SARAH
			Pulse is dropping. 170..
			150 .... 160..

	There is NOTHING left of Sebastian Caine.

				LINDA
			Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at
			18:26.

	The screaming continues and the restraints continue to 
	twist and turn. Suddenly the restraints go limp.

				MATT
			Is he dead?

	Linda checks the readouts.

				LINDA
			No. He passed out from the trauma.

				SARAH
			Vitals returning to normal. Pulse 110 
			... dropping. Blood pressure 130 over 
			75.

	A long beat as everybody's eyes stare at the instruments.

				FRANK (V.O.)
			Electrical activity is stabilizing.

				SARAH
			Pulse steady at 70.

	A long beat.

				MATT
			Un-fucking-believable.

	A reverent pause as Linda runs her fingers over what 
	would be his skin. Small electrical charge dance around 
	her fingertips. She gasps.

				LINDA
				 (whispers in his ear)
			You did it, Sebastian. You're the 
			first.

				CARTER
			Let's get him into recovery.

								
	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER

	The chamber is half constructed out of Plexiglas at the 
	end of the Hallway of Habitats.

	On the recovery bed, a sheet drapes over Sebastian's 
	invisible body. The gentle bleatings of medical machinery 
	pound out a dulling rhythm.

	Linda sleeps in a corner chair as Matt slips into the 
	room. He checks the readouts on Sebastian then takes a 
	seat by Linda. She wakes with a start.

				MATT
			S'okay. You nodded off.

				LINDA
			His breathing's hypnotic. How long's 
			it been?

				MATT
			Seventeen hours.

				LINDA
			Where are the others?

				MATT
			In the lab crunching numbers. We've 
			got enough data there for two 
			lifetimes of research.

	Linda rubs her temples and gestures to the bed.

				LINDA
			I keep looking at that hole, wondering 
			if he's really there.

	She notices something out of the corner of his eye. The 
	sheet twitches.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Did you see...

	The sheet twitches again.

				MATT
			He may be coming out of it.

	Linda and Matt watch intently. Then suddenly... the 
	sheets thrash violently. A yell of pain.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			The lights! Turn off the goddamn 
			lights! Ah Christ!

	Linda jumps up and crosses to Sebastian. Matt rushes to 
	the wall and turns off the lights. Darkness. The room is 
	lit by the glow of machinery.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			I can't... I can't close my eyes. I 
			can't close my eyes.

				LINDA
			Your eyelids are transparent.

	The sheets slowly stop thrashing.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			So I ... I'm...

				LINDA
			Yes.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			My arms. I can.. where? ... I can feel 
			them...

				LINDA
			Your arms ... your whole body... It 
			worked, Sebastian. It worked.

	The sheet rises and slips away. The wires, seemingly 
	connected to thin air, spread out like a spider's web and 
	then fall away one-by-one. The monitors all go dead.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Mirror. I ... I want to see.

				MATT
			Over here in the corner.

	Matt motions to a dark corner of the room, toward a 
	mirror and sink. We push in on the mirror. No reflection. 
	Suddenly it fogs up ... Sebastian's breath. A finger 
	tracing appears in the fog ... but of course we see no 
	finger. The sink faucet twists on and water runs. It cups 
	into the shape of hands and lifts into the air, splashing 
	against the surface of Sebastian's face. Beads of water 
	cling to his f ace, outlining it I shape f or a moment 
	before dripping away.

				MATT (cont'd)
			What was it like?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I ... It's hard to think.

	Sebastian's voice is now behind him. Matt turns around.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			The transformation... I remember every 
			molecule in my body shattering.

				MATT
			It was painful?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			At first... but then everything went 
			black. I couldn't see or hear or feel 
			anything. It was all just black... 
			like I wasn't connected.

				LINDA
			Your system received quite a shock.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			At least my senses are starting to 
			return... You're wearing your 
			Shalimar, aren't you?

	Linda realizes that he's standing very close by. Her hair 
	lifts slightly and Sebastian inhales. Chills go down her 
	spine.

				LINDA
			Sebastian.

	Linda's hair drops back to her shoulders.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			This is weird. I'm looking through 
			myself at the floor. I'm looking right 
			through myself. I can't tell ...

	He bumps into a chair.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			... where my body is.

	A moment of silence.

				LINDA
			Sebastian?

	No answer. Linda and Matt look at each other, slightly 
	alarmed.

				MATT
			Sebastian?

	An indentation forms on the bed a moment later.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You really can't see me. Can you?

				LINDA
			Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea, 
			headache, body-ache, disorientation.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			No, just tired.
				 (beat)
			It's funny. I can see everything... 
			more than before... but I can't see 
			myself.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Carter, Frank, Janice and Sarah work at various research 
	stations. The door opens and Linda and Matt enter.

				CARTER
			Hey. How's he doing?

				LINDA
			Why don't you ask him?

	Linda motions to the gap between her and Matt. The four 
	of them stare at the nothing.

				SARAH
			Sebastian, how do you feel.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Not to bad, considering.

	They turn round. The voice is coming from behind them. 
	The group rises from their various workstations and turn 
	toward where the voice came from.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Odd, isn't it?

	A rheostat switch on the wall turns and the lights dim. 
	Though it's a simple act, it feels somewhat ominous.

				LINDA
			He can't close his eyes so they're 
			sensitive to light.

	Linda's explanation puts everyone at ease.

				JANICE
			So, what was it like?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Over here.

	Sebastian has moved. As everyone turns toward him again, 
	he can't stifle a slight giggle.

				LINDA
			C'mon Sebastian. Knock it off.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Sorry. Couldn't resist.

	His voice again come s from somewhere else in the room.

				FRANK
			I feel like we're playing Marco Polo.

				MATT
			Well, I see the procedure hasn't 
			changed your personality.

	Frank pulls on a pair of THERMAL GOGGLES.

				FRANK
			No worries. I'm on it.

	THERMAL POV - Every body in the laboratory shows up as a 
	heat signature, including Sebastian. Frank points.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			Gotcha, big man.

	THERMAL POV - The HEAT SIGNATURE reaches for a chair.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Boy, you people have no sense of 
			humor.

	A chair slides back from a desk and bends under 
	Sebastian's weight.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Show me. So ...

									
	CUT TO:

	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

	Frank and Janice shuttle the playback controls as a VIDEO 
	MONITOR re-plays various angles of Sebastian's phase 
	shift.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Stop there.

	Frank halts the tape.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Index that. That was when it started 
			burn. Epidermal reaction.

				JANICE
			Index Mark. 112125.

	Janice scribble the numbers in her notebook. Linda 
	crosses, nursing a cup of coffee.

				LINDA
			It's late. Time you got some rest.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Just a little longer.

				LINDA
			Hate to pull rank, but you're my 
			patient now and you need rest. We've 
			got a busy day tomorrow.

	Heavy sigh.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Fine.

	

	INT. THE RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

	As Linda enters she points to a small camera in the upper 
	corner of the room.

				LINDA
			We've set up a thermal camera for 
			observation and I've arranged one of 
			us to be here 24/7 in case you need 
			anything. The team's gonna be on alpha-
			call alert for the duration. If 
			anything goes wrong, we can all be 
			here within...

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Thirty minutes. Yes,,_I know. I wrote 
			the procedure.

				LINDA
			I was trying to be reassuring.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You like this don't you?

				LINDA
			What's that?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Being in charge.

	It's clear she does. But she's certainly not going to 
	admit it.

				LINDA
			Please. I'm just doing my job.

									
	CUT TO:

	CLOSE ON: A video screen. A thermal lump lays stretched 
	out on the bed.

	Pull back to reveal SARAH staring at the screen. We are.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	A bank of monitors display the various angles of the Hall 
	of Habitats, the laboratory and, of course, Sebastian in 
	the recovery room.

	Linda hands Sarah a cup of coffee.

				LINDA
			You gonna be okay?

				SARAH
			Fine. It's not like I have anything 
			else going on in my sad pathetic life.

				LINDA
			Carter'll be in at six to spell you 
			and I'll be in by nine. Call me if 
			anything happens, okay?

	Through the glass wall, Linda sees Matt knocking and 
	waving her out.

				SARAH
			I'm fine. Go on ahead.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	The rest of the team straggles into the elevator. 
	Yawning. Exhausted from the day.

				CARTER
			Man, I'm tired. That was a long day.

				LINDA
			Days only get longer from here.

	Linda catches Matt's eye. Gives him a look. "You coming 
	over?" Matt nods, "yes", imperceptible to everyone but 
	Linda. She smiles.

								
	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

	Deserted and dark.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Late. Sarah rubs her temples. Her eyelids are heavy. 
	She's having real trouble staying awake. The buzzing 
	fluorescent light isn't helping either.

	INT. RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

	The sheets ruffle and the indentation disappears from the 
	bed. We can hear breathing and soft sound of bare feet 
	shuffling against linoleum.

	CAMERA SLOWLY PANS toward the door, as if we, are 
	following someone walking.

	The door handle turns and the door pushes open.

	INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

	WE SLOWLY TRACK DOWN the Hallway of the Habitats. We hear 
	the sounds of sleeping creatures. A couple of them growl 
	at something unseen. The growling follows the invisible 
	something as it passes by.

	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

	The laboratory door opens and shuts again. Ghostly. We 
	see papers shuffling at one of the work stations. A glass 
	moves slightly.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Sarah reclines in her chair. Fast asleep, Behind her is 
	the glass wall, revealing the empty hallway behind it.

	But a small portion of the glass fogs, as if someone had 
	just breathed on it. As the fogged part quickly clears, 
	we see the door to the observation room quietly open.

	ON SARAH, still sleeping. We hear a whisper.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
				 (whispering)
			Sarah. Are you awake?

	Her heavy breathing mixes with Sebastian's.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
				 (barely audible)
			Hmm.

	Sarah's hair moves slightly, as if a hand were running 
	through it. And then we see her shirt move, like fingers 
	were tracing over it. Down from the shoulder to her 
	breast. Around her nipple. Sarah moans slightly, as if 
	she were dreaming, but she doesn't stir. And then her 
	breasts cup slightly, as if they were being touched... 
	softly... gently. Her breathing becomes harder, more 
	labored, erotic... and then she... BOLTS AWAKE. Bar eyes 
	wide with fear. She jumps and cups her own breasts and 
	looks around the room. It's empty, of course. She jumps 
	over to the monitor and checks on Sebastian's room. The 
	heat signature isn't there.

				SARAH
			Dr. Caine! Goddamnit, Dr. Caine! Are 
			you in here?

	She listens. It's silent. She tries holding her breath, 
	listening for his breathing. But there's nothing.

	Sarah reaches over to a microphone. Hits a few switches.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Dr. Caine?

	VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE COMPOUND

	- LABORATORY

				SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER)
			Dr. Caine, please report in.

	- HALLWAY OF HABITATS

				SARAH (V.0.,LOUDSPEAKER)
			Dr. Caine, report in please!

	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

	Sarah waits. No response.

				SARAH
			Shit. 

	She looks around the room. He must be in here.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Dr. Caine? Sebastian? Come on, this 
			isn't funny. I know you're in here. 

	Nothing. No response. Sarah waves her hand around, 
	reaching out, trying to find him. After a few beats she 
	stops and rubs her head.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			I must be going crazy.

	Suddenly, Sarah gets an idea. She quickly exits the 
	observation room.

	EXT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	At a wall storage box, she removes a pair of Thermal 
	Goggles and slips them on.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Sarah enters wearing the thermals. She scans the room.

	THERMAL POV - The room is empty.

	She pulls the goggles off in frustration, and when she 
	glances over at the video screen, she sees Sebastian's 
	thermal image lying on the bed in the recovery room.

	Sarah sinks into her chair, a tad disconcerted.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING

	Linda and Matt finish listening to Sarah's story.

				SARAH
			I found him later in the lab, running 
			samples.

				LINDA
			Why didn't you call me?

				SARAH
			Because I wasn't sure. I'm still not. 
			I mean, I could've easily been 
			dreaming.

				MATT
			It doesn't sound like something 
			Sebastian would do.

				SARAH
			God, I feel so stupid.

				LINDA
			I can talk to him.

				SARAH
			No. I mean...
				 (she torn, unsure of herself)
			It was probably nothing. I 
			shouldn't've mentioned it.

				MATT
			You sure?

				SARAH
			Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, y'know, why 
			would he do that, right? Just, this 
			place at night can be kinda creepy, 
			y'know.

	INT. RESEARCH LAB - DAY

	Sebastian, wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination 
	chair. Wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his 
	head and arms. The electrodes seem to outline his body.

				MATT
			So, how was your first night?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Restless. Hard to sleep when you can't 
			close your eyes.

	As Sebastian talks, we can see the electrodes around his 
	jaw pump up and down.

				MATT
			Yeah? What'd you do?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Got up a couple of times. Knocked 
			about.

				MATT
			Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren't in 
			your cubicle. She said she called you 
			over the intercom and you didn't 
			respond.

				SEBASTIAN
			I guess I didn't hear. I had the radio 
			on.

				MATT
			It'd be helpful to us if you'd tell 
			whoever's on duty where you're going 
			to. I mean, if something were to 
			happen, we'd want to know where to 
			find you.

				SEBASTIAN
			I didn't think it was a problem.

				MATT
			It isn't. I just don't want it to 
			become one.

	Machines pump out EEG, EKG readouts. Matt studies them.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Readings are normal.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Next I want to run a VV and UVF 
			analysis of the platelets.

				MATT
			We'll have to draw some more blood.

									
	CUT TO:

	Sarah rolls up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing empty air. 
	She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing, pulls it 
	tight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye. She 
	acts very self conscious.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You okay?

				SARAH
			Yeah. Why?

				SEBASTIAN
			You just seem a little nervous.

				SARAH
			No. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This 
			might hurt a bit.

	The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda 
	searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times, 
	then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin. His skin 
	bends and gives. The needle remains in sight after it 
	slips through the visible surface. Sarah presses down on 
	the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid, 
			but are you... are you looking at me. 

	The red dye twists into a long snaking red tube up and 
	down his arm. His vein.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			No. I was looking at the clock. Why? 

	Sarah draws the plunger back, sucking Sebastian's blood 
	into the hypodermic and then yanks the needle out.

				SARAH
			Just felt like someone was staring at 
			me.

	Sarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a 
	grease pencil. After a few beats the red dye in 
	Sebastian's blood stream dissolves and disappears, as 
	does the liquid in the vial.

	TESTING MONTAGE

	INT. MRI ROOM

	MATT slides Sebastian's sheet covered frame into an MRI. 
	Even though his head is not visible, it shown up on the 
	MRI scanner.

	INT. MAIN LABORATORY

	CARTER and SARAH lower a harness into a water tank. 
	SEBASTIAN'S BODY displaces the water, revealing an empty 
	body shaped cavity in the water.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	CARTER sips a BIG GULP and stares at a monitor which 
	shows two eat signatures in the Recovery Chamber, huddled 
	over a chess game.

	INT. RECOVER CHAMBER

	on a chessboard... A BLACK KNIGHT takes WHITE BISHOP, 
	seemingly all by itself.

	Across the table, Matt leans back and topples his WHITE 
	KING acknowledging defeat.

	INT. SPECTRAL LAB

	Dim lights. Janice and Frank both don eye guards. Frank 
	switches on a low intensity laser on and it's beam shoots 
	across the room. The beam distorts slightly in the center 
	of the room. As Frank widens the spectral pattern, 
	suddenly the beam splits into a million different 
	spectral rainbows, momentary illuminating Sebastian's 
	entire frame in a glowing tingle of light.

	INT. MAIN LABORATORY

	LINDA pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood 
	sample slides. She slips them under the microscope. She 
	takes a sip of her Diet Coke and puts it on the table. 
	She pears into the microscope and analyses the blood 
	sample, squeezing more stain onto it. She looks up to 
	make notations, but when she reaches for her Diet Coke IT 
	ISN'T THERE. She looks around. It's on the other side of 
	her microscope. She shrugs it off, she takes a sip and 
	sets it down where it was before. She peers into the 
	microscope again and when she looks up... the Diet Coke 
	is gone. She looks around the room and sees it on another 
	table completely.

				LINDA
			Sebastian? Goddamnit.

	We hear Sebastian's laughter echo in the room.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You've no idea how much fun I've had. 
			I'm going to hate going back.

				LINDA
			That's what worries me.?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			How so?

				LINDA
			What happens when we turn the project 
			over to the Army. Ever wonder how much 
			fun they're gonna have?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Maybe we won't give it to them. His 
			voice comes from behind her now.

	We see indentations on her shoulders where his fingers 
	press down.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			I was thinking... tonight's my last 
			night. Ever fantasize about making 
			love to an invisible man?

	Linda pulls away from him.

				LINDA
			Stop it, Sebastian. It's not funny.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Well, don't do it for me. Do it for 
			science. 

	Linda walks away. Sebastian laughs.

				LINDA
			Grow up.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Oh well. Missed your big chance.

				LINDA
			Got some sleep. Big day tomorrow.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	A bevy of activity below us as the scientists prepare. 
	Matt slides the antigen cocktail into the centrifuge and 
	starts it spinning.

	A sheet drapes over a Sebastian's frame, straps across 
	his limbs. He is fully wired.

	Linda looks up to the observation booth.

				LINDA
			Recording?

	Frank peers down at her from the booth, his voice echoing 
	through the chamber.

				FRANK
			Recording. Subject Doctor Sebastian 
			Caine. Currently in phase shift... 
			Three days, seven hours.

				LINDA
			De-Phase protocol. Injecting Serial 
			Protein Caine One Two Seven.

	Matt removes the glowing vial of orange liquid from a 
	centrifuge nearby. Carter hands Matt a hypo. Matt jabs it 
	into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid. Linda 
	sprays Sebastian's arm with dye.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Ready?

				SEBASTIAN
			Not really. I was just starting to 
			enjoy myself.

				LINDA
			Tough.

				MATT
			Okay, man. Here we go.

	Matt inserts the hypo into the vein and presses down on 
	the plunger. The liquid begins to react. Small flashes of 
	light blip up and down the strand of color outlining the 
	vein.

	Ba-bump.. ba-bump... the heartbeat starts to speed up.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Wait... something... something doesn't 
			feel right.

				SARAH
			Heartbeat elevated.


	INT. OBSERVATION BOOTH

	Janice and Frank look over the equipment.

				FRANK
			Vitals still nominal..

	INT. LABORATORY

	The glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex 
	webbing of a bloodstream appears.

	Spreading out from the bloodstream, soon becomes visible 
	... the shadow of a skeletal system.

				SEBASTIAN
			I can't br... br...

	Sebastian begins wheezing.

				LINDA
			What's wrong?

				SARAH
			He's not breathing.

	Muscles are beginning to appear. And eyeballs. Frightened 
	eyeballs.

				MATT
			Subject manifesting.

				SARAH
			Pulse erratic.

	Sebastian pulls against his bonds. One set tears off.

				LINDA
			Carter!

	Carter grabs onto the mass of flesh and muscle, trying to 
	hold it back. But the restraints snap. The half-visible 
	man is screaming. He grabs Carter and throws him across 
	the room.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Sebastian! Sebastian!

	And just for a second, Sebastian is fully visible. And 
	free. He looks around like a scared animal and rips off 
	all the wiring.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Sebastian!

				MATT
			Get a tranq. Stat.

	Sarah preps a tranquilizer. Sebastian locks eyes with 
	Linda. He's lost, he doesn't know where he is. And 
	suddenly, he crumbles to the ground. Linda rushes over to 
	him and puts bar hand on his shoulder. Light bleeds from 
	his skin and his skin begins to dissolve from sight.

				LINDA
			He's reverting. Got him on the table. 

	Matt, Linda and Sarah pull the shifting body up and onto 
	an operating table. Carter pulls himself up and heads 
	back to the group.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Get me a I.V. of A.G. seven.

				SARAH
			I got no pulse. No pulse.

				MATT
			Start CPR.

	Carter locates Sebastian's heart, not a difficult thing 
	because we can actually see it. Carter's hand pushes down 
	in the air inches above the heart. We see the heart being 
	pushed and squeezed. Sarah slaps an air bag on Sebastian 
	and starts pumping air into his lungs. Sebastian's heart 
	begins to beat again, beat on its own.

				CARTER
			Getting a pulse.

				MATT
			Holy shit. What happened?

				LINDA
			Sebastian... can you hear me? Can you 
			hear me? How are his pupils?

				MATT
			I can't see his goddamn pupils!

				SARAH
			I think he's going into shock.

	We slowly FADE OUT to the sights and sounds of our 
	scientist- doctors working on Sebastian... And the 
	beeping of Sebastian's erratic heartbeat.

									 FADE 
UP ON:

	A HABITAT

	The heartbeat continues. In the shadows, two Rhesus 
	Monkeys defend themselves against an unseen attacker. 
	Blood splatters against the Plexiglas wall.

	We FADE OUT AGAIN...

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Linda stares through the Plexiglas walls into the 
	Recovery Chamber. Inside the Chamber, Sarah and Carter-
	eye the various screens monitoring Sebastian's vitals.

	Linda watches the hollow pocket underneath the blanket. 
	She watches the rhythm of its rises and falls as 
	Sebastian sleeps. Matt comes up behind her.

				MATT
			Just got the tissue sample results. 
			Cellular cohesion is stable.

	Linda exhales in relief. Matt puts his hands on her 
	shoulder. Pulls her close to him.

				MATT (cont'd)
			How bout you? You gonna be okay?

				LINDA
			Guess so.
				 (beat)
			I was just thinking about the Apollo 
			missions. Y'know? Grissom, White and 
			Chaffee... What it was like for them 
			on that launch pad that day, thinking 
			they were gonna reach the stars only 
			to burn to death.

				MATT
			Sometimes the test pilots make 
			history. Sometimes the planes crash 
			and people die.

				LINDA
			But he didn't die, did he?
				 (beat)
			What if we can't bring him back? What 
			then?

				MATT
			It's just a little hitch is all. He'll 
			be the first to tell that he'll crack 
			it and I'm sure he will. It'll just 
			take time.
				 (beat)
			Listen, let's got out of here. We 
			could drive up to the old observatory. 
			We'll take some wine and go count the 
			stars and forget all this for awhile. 

	She pulls away.

				LINDA
			No. I want to be here for him.

	Linda pushes through the door of the recovery chamber and 
	takes a seat by Sebastian's bedside. A little hurt, Matt 
	heads down the corridor.

	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

	Frank and Janice are staring into their coffee when Matt 
	enters. Matt crosses to the coffee machine and pours 
	himself a cup. He takes a seat at the table. They all 
	drink their coffee in silent vigil.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

	Linda sits by Sebastian's bedside, listening to the 
	constant rhythm of the machines.

	The sheets shift.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
				 (weak)
			Hey...

				LINDA
			Hey...

	

				SEBASTIAN 
			So I guess it didn't work.

	Linda shakes her head.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You look worried. It must've been bad. 

	Sebastian's voice is weak and strained.

				LINDA
			You almost died.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Well, remember your Nietchze. Whatever 
			doesn't kill me, makes me stronger. 

	Linda smiles.

				LINDA
			I should be making you feel better. 
			Not vice versa.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I guess if I'm going to be stuck this 
			way for awhile, I'd better make some 
			adjustments.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

	In a dusty shaft of light...

	A cotton swab.

	is dipped by a gloved hand into a jar of flesh-colored 
	cream make-up. We follow the hand as it raises the cotton 
	swab into the darkness. The swab strokes over the black 
	and the rich fleshy cream spreads, revealing...

	EYE LIDS of a closed eye.

	The eyelids part, unveiling...

	PITCH BLACK. Blink. Blink.

	No eye.

	Not even a trace of a eye socket. Just darkness.

	A COLORED CONTACT LENS floats through mid-air... hovering 
	before the eyelids. It turns and fastens itself to the 
	darkness between the lids.

	We PULL BACK slowly as Sebastian lifts a latex FACE MASK 
	and pulls it over his head.

	He checks his reflection in the mirror. He looks almost 
	human. Almost. A face, eyes, hands ... the rest of him 
	covered by surgical scrubs.

	We pull back and see the rest of the team looking on.

				MATT
			Not too bad.

				SEBASTIAN
			The latex'll limit the amount of light 
			delivered to my optic nerves.

				LINDA
			You could almost pass for human. 

	Sebastian rises. He looks eerily removed from reality 
	with his cold blank expression.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Well, it gives you a face to talk to 
			at least, and we can all work in 
			normal light again.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	SERIES OF SHOTS

	Carter draws blood from Sebastian.

	Samples are placed into the cyclotron.

	Matt peers through the eyepiece of a microscope. He makes 
	notes.

	Frank and Janice finish a computer simulation on a 
	protein strand. Matt looks over. They shake their heads, 
	no.

	Sebastian slides into the MRI.

	Linda examines a petri dish. She throws her pencil down 
	in frustration.

	Sebastian is hit by the spectral radiation beams.

	Matt pulls a vial of orange liquid from the cyclotron.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Sebastian, still in his latex and scrubs, but looking 
	like he's been dragged through the nine levels of 
	purgatory, is escorted back to the recovery chamber by 
	Linda and Matt.

	He crosses to his bed and collapses on it. Closes his 
	eyes.

				SEBASTIAN
			The testing's making me sick.

				LINDA
			Could be the barium or the radiation.

				MATT
			You're physiology has changed and, 
			well, all bets are off.

				SEBASTIAN
			I can't believe I have to spend 
			another night here.
				 (to Linda)
			Suppose you're gonna go home now, meet 
			up with that boyfriend of yours now. 

	Linda and Matt exchange a glance. Linda quickly covers.

				LINDA
			Do you want me to stay?

				SEBASTIAN
			No. That's okay. It's just, being a 
			guinea pig is more work than I 
			thought. I'll be fine.

	INT. RESEARCH COMPOUND - NIGHT

	Various shots of the empty hallways and deserted labs.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Carter kicks back in his chair listening to his walkman 
	stereo and playing gameboy.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

	Sebastian, in scrubs and make-up, paces back and forth.

	He slams the wall in frustration. He crosses to a mirror 
	and examines himself. He doesn't look half bad. He pokes 
	his cheeks. There's something about him that's a little 
	off, but only if you look close.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	A shadow falls across Carter's face. He looks up. It's 
	Sebastian wearing street clothes - jeans and a hooded 
	sweatshirt over his latex mask.

	Carter pulls of his earphones.

				CARTER
				 (surprised)
			Dr. Caine. What's up?

				SEBASTIAN
			Just stopped by to let you know, I'm 
			going out for a bit.

	Sebastian turns back into the hallway.

				CARTER
			Going out? Hey wait a sec!

	Carter scrambles to his feet.

	INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Carter catches up with Sebastian.

				CARTER
			What do you mean going out for a bit?

				SEBASTIAN
			If I don't get out of here, I'm gonna 
			go crazy.

				CARTER
			But you're not supposed to leave the 
			compound.

				SEBASTIAN
			Why not?

				CARTER
			That's the rule.

				SEBASTIAN
			Yes, but I made that rule. It's my 
			rule and I'm changing it.

				CARTER
			You can't just change it.

	Sebastian hits the elevator button. The doors open.

				SEBASTIAN
			Carter, I was suppose to be like this 
			for three days. Three fucking days and 
			I'll be damned if I'm going to spend 
			the rest of my life as a prisoner in 
			this godforsaken dump. Now I'm going 
			out. I'll be back in a couple of 
			hours. Okay?

	The elevator doors close with Sebastian inside. Shit.

				CARTER
			Shit.

	Carter runs down the corridor.

	INT OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Carter picks up the phone and dials.

	A beat then.

				CARTER
			Yeah, it's Carter. We got a problem.

	INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	The elevator doors open and Sebastian pushes past the 
	Marine Guard.

				MARINE GUARD
			Hey, Doc. Haven't seen you for awhile? 

	Sebastian keeps his face turned away as he crosses to his 
	Porsche.

				SEBASTIAN
			Yeah, well. You know how it in 
			sometimes.

				MARINE GUARD
			You got that right, sir. I was 
			beginning to worry 'cause your car 
			hadn't moved.

				SEBASTIAN
			Thanks, but everything's cool. 

	Sebastian starts his car. It chugs a few times before 
	turning over and speeding out of the warehouse.

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The door opens and Sebastian switches on the lights.

	He looks around his apartment and sighs. It's good to be 
	home.

	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Sebastian enters the bedroom, clicking on the light. He 
	looks at the ceiling, "You Should Be Working", and 
	smiles.

	INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING, PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

	Linda and Matt each rush to their respective cars.

				MATT
			He could be anywhere. Hell he could be 
			right behind us.

				LINDA
			I'll meet you at the lab. I'm gonna 
			swing by his place, just in case.

				MATT
			See you there.

	Matt tries to give her a quick pack. Linda backs away.

				LINDA
				 (quietly, looking around)
			I don't want him to see.

				MATT
				 (looking around too)
			What a mess.

	They get in their cars.

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Sebastian packs up a few personal belongings in an 
	overnight duffle. He crosses to his bookcase and pulls 
	out some books and throws them into the bag.

	But as he does, he notices a light come on in the window 
	across the courtyard. Sebastian turns off his bedroom 
	light and moves toward the window. He peers across the 
	courtyard into the Brunette's apartment.

	He watches the Brunette as she comes into the living room 
	from her front hallway. She drops her keys on the table 
	and begins unbuttoning her blouse as she crosses to the 
	window. Just as the blouse slips off her shoulder, she 
	pulls her blinds shut.

				SEBASTIAN
			Shit.

	Frustrated, Sebastian steps away from the window and then 
	stops. Something has occurred to him.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Don't even think it...

	He looks down and notices his hand is trembling. His 
	breathing is a little heavy. A little nervous. He catches 
	a glimpse at himself in the mirror.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
				 (almost whispering)
			Once...just once.

	The Brunette's living room light switches off and the 
	bathroom light switches on. We see him fighting an 
	internal battle and we see him lose it. He grabs a hold 
	of his hand and peels the latex skin off.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	Linda drives Sebastian's apartment. She spots his black 
	Porsche in the parking lot. She pulls over to the curb, 
	jumps out of her car and heads into the building.

	INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Wearing just a robe, the brunette turns on her shower. 
	The doorbell rings. With a frustrated sigh, the brunette 
	rises.

	AT THE FRONT DOOR

	She peers through the peep hole. No one's there. But as 
	she turns she hears the doorbell again. She opens the 
	door, steps out into the hallway and looks around. Empty. 
	Puzzled she heads back inside her apartment.

	We follow her as she crosses to her bedroom, but a moment 
	later, the bedroom door closes on its own.

	We hear a SCREAM come from the other side. Then another. 
	Then a muffled struggled. And we...

									
	CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY, SEBASTIAN BUILDING - NIGHT

	Linda exits the elevator and heads down to Sebastian's 
	door. She knocks. Waits. No answer. She knocks again. 
	Waits.

	And then she tries the door. It's unlocked. She pushes 
	the door open.

				LINDA
			Sebastian?

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Linda pushes through the living room, into the bedroom.

				LINDA
			Sebastian?

	She notices that the bathroom light is on.

	BATHROOM

	On the floor she finds Sebastian's clothing and on the 
	vanity she sees his latex face and hands.

				LINDA
			Oh shit.

	She scramble for the bedroom phone and quickly dials.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Yeah, Matt, it's me. He was here. No. 
			He's taken his make-up off. I don't 
			know...He must be outside somewhere.
			I don't know where he went. I'm coming 
			back to the lab. How? How'm I supposed 
			to do that? I CAN'T FUCKING SEE HIM! 
			We're going on alpha call.  I want 
			everyone at the lab now. We're gonna 
			need thermal visors and we may need 
			tranqs.

	As she hangs up the phone, and heads out. The CAMERA 
	doesn't follow, but instead pushes through the blinds and 
	out the window. As we cross the courtyard, we begin to 
	hear muffled cries of terror. We hold on the Brunette's 
	window as we...

									
	CUT TO:

	INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The bedroom door opens and we see the Brunette, nude and 
	curled up on the bed, sobbing. We follow the sounds of 
	heavy breathing to the front door of her apartment. The 
	door opens and we push out into the hallway. We can see 
	indentations of feet appear on the hallway carpet.

	INT. CORRIDOR BY SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT

	The elevator doors open and Linda steps inside. The doors 
	close shut behind her. A beat later we see the 
	indentations of footsteps come around the corner. We 
	follow the breathing and stumbling footfalls back into...

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	We push over to the bathroom sink. The faucet turns on 
	and the water starts running.

	We see the water cup under the faucet and splash against 
	Sebastian's face. His face appears briefly in the water. 
	Then the water slips away.

	For second it sounds like he's crying, but then we hear 
	something far worse. He's laughing. Nervous laughter.

	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

	Matt hands out thermal goggles, while Frank loads and 
	passes out tranquilizer guns.

				JANICE
			What are the tranqs for?

				LINDA
			Use your imagination.

				JANICE
			Are you saying he's dangerous?

				MATT
			We're just saying we need to be 
			cautious.

				LINDA
			The Metro stops running after midnight 
			and he's on foot, so he can't have 
			gotten too far.

				CARTER
			Look, this isn't a monkey we're 
			talking about. It's Dr. Caine. Don't 
			you think you're over reacting?

				LINDA
			This program is classified. If he's 
			out there it means someone might find 
			out about him. He could destroy the 
			whole program.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Relax, Linda. No one's gonna find out. 

	They all turn around. At the door is Sebastian, back in 
	his latex outfit.

				MATT
			Where the hell have you been?

				SEBASTIAN
			I got a little stir crazy, so I went 
			to my apartment to pick up some stuff.

				LINDA
			Bullshit! I went to your apartment and 
			I happen to know you did a helluva lot 
			more than pick some stuff up.

				SEBASTIAN
			What are you talking about?

				LINDA
			You, of all people How could you? 

	Caught dead to rights, Sebastian sinks into his chair. He 
	thinks she knows.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			You put yourself and this project at 
			risk.

				SEBASTIAN
			Just what did you see in my apartment?

				LINDA
			I saw your face and your clothes.

				MATT
			It was bad enough you left without an 
			escort, but to take off the...
				 (he motions to his face)
			out in public?

	Sebastian realizes that they don't know.

				SEBASTIAN
			Don't make a mountain out of molehill. 
			I didn't let anyone see me.

				LINDA
			That's not good enough. When you're 
			outside the lab there are a thousand 
			variables none of us can control. It's 
			just not safe for you to be out there.

				SEBASTIAN
			Come on, Linda. You don't expect me to 
			be some kind of prisoner.

				LINDA
			You volunteered for this, Sebastian. 
			You knew going in there could be 
			consequences.
				 (beat)
			For the security of this project, I'm 
			gonna have to ask you to confine 
			yourself to the compound.

				SEBASTIAN
			I'm still Project Leader, Linda. It's 
			my decision to make.

				LINDA
			You're right. It's your decision. But 
			if you leave the compound again, I'll 
			notify the oversight committee. Then 
			they can make the decision. You 
			understand?

				SEBASTIAN
			Matt?

				MATT
			Sorry, man. You'd do the same if it 
			were the other way around.

	A long beat. Sebastian slowly rises, acknowledges Linda 
	with a nod and leaves the room. Linda looks around at her 
	silent co-workers, the goggles and tranqs still on the 
	table.

				LINDA
			Pack 'em up... Everyone go home.

								
	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	The Lab is buzzing with the usual activity. Linda rolls 
	up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing nothing.

				LINDA
			Hold still.

	She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing and pulls it 
	tight. She then sprays the inside of his elbow with dye.

				SEBASTIAN
				 (contentious)
			How much blood do you think you've 
			taken so far?

	The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda 
	searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times, 
	then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin.

				LINDA
			Not enough to worry about.

				SEBASTIAN
			Every day... feels like you're sucking 
			me dry.

	Linda presses down on the hypodermic plunger, releasing a 
	dye into his bloodstream.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			It's funny. All these years I've known 
			you, I never pegged you for a 
			megalomanic.

				LINDA
			What are you talking about?

				SEBASTIAN
			The shoe being on the other foot. You 
			getting to run things.

				LINDA
			I didn't ask for this, Caine. But when 
			a classified experiment disappears in 
			the middle of the night, someone's 
			gotta run the show.
				 (tries sympathy)
			Look, I know how hard this has been 
			for you.

	He knocks her arm away and pulls the hypo, out of his 
	arm.

				SEBASTIAN
			Don't patronize me.
				 (beat)
			And for the record, you've got no idea 
			what it's like. I get up every morning 
			and you people stick needles in me. 
			You bombard me with radiation until I 
			vomit. And then at six it's over for 
			you. You get to go home. But Sebastian 
			is still here. Sebastian can't leave, 
			or else. That's the worst part, you 
			know. Here I have this ... this GIFT 
			and I can't even use it.

				LINDA
			Now it's a gift?

				SEBASTIAN
			You're goddamn right it's a gift. And 
			if you weren't so goddamned short 
			sighted, I'd be out there right now 
			trying to master it. 

	Sebastian looks around at the other scientists staring at 
	him. He tosses the hypo with the needle onto the 
	instrument tray and heads toward the door.

				LINDA
			Where're you going?

				SEBASTIAN
			Looks like I'm going nowhere.

				MATT
			Come on, man. We've got a ton of tests 
			scheduled today.

				SEBASTIAN
			Do them yourself.


	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Linda enters to find Sebastian reading the collected 
	works of T.S. Elliot.

				LINDA
			Want to talk about it?

				SEBASTIAN
			No.

	Linda looks over his shoulder.

				LINDA
			"We are the hollow men, the stuffed 
			men, headpieces filled with straw."

				SEBASTIAN
			Funny, huh? I've become a literal 
			metaphor.

	He puts the books down.

				LINDA
			I don't want to fight you. I just want 
			what's best for the program.

				SEBASTIAN
			I know. And you being right doesn't 
			make it any easier for me.

				LINDA
			You can be scared. That's okay.

				SEBASTIAN
			I'm not scared of being stuck this 
			way. With a little more make-up and 
			practice, I could...
				 (he motions to his face)
			... pass. Y'know, get by in the world. 
			But the testing...

				LINDA
			You're talking like you've given up. 
			It's only been a few months.

				SEBASTIAN
			What if it's years? I don't know how 
			much more testing I can take.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER

	Sebastian paces back and forth, glancing at the camera.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Linda, Matt and Sebastian, in latex and scrubs, stare at 
	an electron microscope's video display. On the screen in 
	a sparse colony of blood calls but every second more and 
	more cells appear, filling the gap.

				MATT
			60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ...
			85 ...

	The others in the lab listen. They start to get excited. 
	Janice and Carter leave their research and come over to 
	watch the screen.

				SEBASTIAN
			We've got it. We've got it.

				MATT
			93% ... 95%... 95%

	They wait. Linda points to a blank patch on the screen.

				LINDA
			That's all we need.

				SEBASTIAN
			Come on, baby. Come on.

	But the blood cells nearest the blank patch twinkle out 
	existence, and then those around them also blink away 
	until after a beat, the screen is empty.

				MATT
			Full quantum cascade at 95%.
				 (beat)
			I'm sorry.

				SEBASTIAN
			You're sorry? You're fucking sorry? 

	Sebastian picks up a glass beaker and hurls it against 
	the wall. It shatters.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Six weeks of this shit and you're 
			sorry!

	He grabs more equipment and begins tossing it in a rage. 
	Carter and Janice grab him and restrain him. After 
	struggling against them a beat or two, Sebastian calms 
	down and pushes away from them and heads out the door.

				JANICE
			I don't blame him.

				LINDA
			I'll go talk to him.

				MATT
			Leave him alone. He just needs to blow 
			off some steam.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

									
	CUT TO:

	Sebastian lies in his bed, staring at the security 
	camera. The camera stares back at him.

	As if from a dream, we hear the Brunette's muffled scream 
	and cries for help. As we push in on Sebastian's cold 
	eyes, we can barely make out her face thrashing back in 
	forth in panic and confusion.

	Sebastian suddenly rises.

	He crosses to the video camera and examines a small panel 
	on the underneath of the camera.

	He reaches into a box of twinkies and pulls out one of 
	the sponge cakes and begins munching. He hits the 
	intercom button on the phone.

				FRANK (V.0.)
			Yeah?

				SEBASTIAN
			I'm going to the lab.

				FRANK (V.0.)
			Don't you sleep?

				SEBASTIAN
			Waste of time. Da Vinci never slept.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Frank eyes Sebastian in the monitor.

				FRANK
			Okay. I'm here if you need me.

	He watches as Sebastian's heat signature moves toward the 
	door.

	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

	In the dark deserted lab, Sebastian pulls together a 
	circuit board, a computer chip and some wiring. He seems  
	be assembling something.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Sebastian crosses underneath the camera... just out of 
	its range... reaches up and using a screwdriver, unscrews 
	the access panel. He scans the electronics and attaches 
	two alligator clips to wires on the circuit board.

	Trailing a long length of wire, Sebastian crosses back to 
	his bed and lies down. He holds a black project box with 
	a button on it. He lies perfectly still and press the 
	button.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	The video image of the Recovery Chamber flickers 
	slightly, before returning to normal.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Sebastian rises and begins to peel off his latex.

	INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

	Sebastian's POV - Various animals stir restlessly. A DOG, 
	visible, leaps against the Plexiglas, barking wildly. We 
	push further down the corridor.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Again, Sebastian's POV as he pushes through the open door 
	of the observation room. We see Frank sorting through 
	various computer readouts, highlighting certain coding 
	sequences.

	We push in until we are looking over Frank's shoulder at 
	the video monitor. According to the video, Sebastian is 
	sleeping soundly in his room.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

	The rewired security camera stares down at the empty bed.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Frank glances over at the video monitor. He can see 
	Sebastian's heat signature lying in the bed.

	Frank feels something on his neck. He flicks whatever it 
	is away with his hand and goes back to work.

	INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	The elevator door opens. The Guard turns around. The 
	elevator is empty.

	INT. METRO STATION, WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

	A Metro Subway train draws to a halt. With a cautionary 
	"BING BONG" its doors slide open. A handful of people 
	exit and enter. One man bumps shoulders. He turns round 
	to apologize, but there's no one there. The doors close 
	and the train pulls out of the station.

	EXT. DOWNTOWN D.C. - NIGHT

	A couple of pretty girls exit a bar and stumble to their 
	apartments.

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	One of the girls enters her apartment. The door half 
	closes behind her and then reopens and closes again.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING

	Frank's reading a book when Linda and Matt enter.

				MATT
			How'd it go?

				FRANK
			Quiet. He worked in the lab till about 
			10:30 and then went to sleep.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

	Close on the security camera. The wires have been removed 
	and the access panel replaced.

	Sebastian whistles a cheerful tune as he finishes 
	applying his makeup. The door opens and Linda and Matt 
	enter.

				SEBASTIAN
			Ah, my two favorite people. Good 
			morning.

				LINDA
			Good morning.

				MATT
			Why so cheery this morning?

				SEBASTIAN
			You know some days you just wake up 
			feeling the world is full of 
			potential. Like your eyes have been 
			opened.

				MATT
			I'm happy if I make it to my coffee 
			machine.

	Linda hands Sebastian a disk.

				LINDA
			I restructured the third genome on 
			your radiated protein strand. Thought 
			you might want to take look.

				SEBASTIAN
			Cook up a batch and let's see where we 
			go.

				LINDA
			I thought you'd want to take a look at 
			it.

				SEBASTIAN
			I trust you. Now if you'll excuse me, 
			I need to have my head examined.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER - DAY

	Linda pulls bags of frozen plasma from the shelves in the 
	walk-in storage freezer.

				LINDA
			I'm telling you, I know him. 
			Something's going on.

				MATT
			Think he knows about us.

				LINDA
			If he knew about us, he'd be angry and 
			that wasn't angry.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Janice heads up one of the corridors when something on 
	the floor catches her eye. She bends down and takes a 
	look at it. Barely visible on the floor is a fragment of 
	a BAREFOOT FOOTPRINT.

	She runs her finger along the dried mud. It turns to 
	dust.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Sebastian holds his latex head on his lap, while EEG 
	leads hang suspended in mid-air, outlining his real head. 
	Carter analyzes the results.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			When you were a kid, you ever dream 
			about being invisible?

				CARTER
			Sure... all the time.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			What did you imagine you'd do?

				CARTER
			The usual.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			What's the usual?

				CARTER
			Hanging out in the girl's locker room. 
			Kicking Jimmy Margiani's ass.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Jimmy Margiani?

				CARTER
			School asshole. Drove a red Trans Am. 
			Back then, I was the size of a small 
			planet and made a rather large target.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Ever think up anything along the grand 
			scale?

				CARTER
			Sure. World domination. Manipulating 
			stock markets, consolidating a 
			political power base. But those are 
			more recent fantasies.

	Carter pulls off the electrodes and Sebastian slides on 
	his latex facemask.

				SEBASTIAN
			And what if it weren't fantasy? What 
			if you were out there in the world and 
			could do whatever you wanted with no 
			consequences whatsoever. How far would 
			go? I mean... if it were real?

				CARTER
			I don't know, man. Out in the real 
			world... I mean, there's a 
			responsibility...

				SEBASTIAN
			Let's say you saw a woman with amazing 
			tits. Would you brush against them?

				CARTER
			Hell, I try and do that now.

				SEBASTIAN
			Human nature. So if you could get away 
			with more, would you do more?

				CARTER
			I read that in a survey at a major 
			university they asked college students 
			"Would you steal if you were 
			guaranteed to get away with it?" 82% 
			said yes.

				SEBASTIAN
			Eighty two percent? Makes you wonder 
			if the world's ready for what we're 
			doing.

				CARTER
			So, Doc what did you do?

				SEBASTIAN
			What do you mean?

				CARTER
			When you were out.

				SEBASTIAN
			I just walked around. Y'know.

				CARTER
			Aw, you just walked around? Come on. 
			There's more, right?

				SEBASTIAN
			Like what?

				CARTER
			Man, I'd be walking up to people 
			saying shit like "This is God, go,get 
			a haircut." Or hanging out in the 
			changing room at Victoria's Secret.

				SEBASTIAN
			Kind of sophomoric, don't you think. 
			Besides, it was late and I wasn't out 
			that long.

				CARTER
			Well, did you see anybody?

				SEBASTIAN
			There was this one girl.

				CARTER
			Yeah? And did you mess with her? 

				SEBASTIAN
			Naw...

	Sebastian gives Carter a sly grin.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			Well maybe a little.
				 (beat)
			I tell you though, a man could get 
			used to it.

	INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT

	Alone, Linda packs up her stuff for the evening.

	Slowly we push in on her and hear quiet breathing. We 
	realize we are in...

	SEBASTIAN'S POV

	Then ...

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Goodnight.

	Linda-jumps.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Sorry, didn't mean to frighten you.

				LINDA
			It's fine. I just didn't know you were 
			there. Goodnight.

	As she leaves the Lab, he follows her down the hallway.

	EXT. LINDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

	Linda passes through the revolving doors of her apartment 
	building. A few beats later, as if caught by a gust of 
	wind, the revolving door slowly turns on its own.

	INT. APARTMENT'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Linda slips into her apartment and the door closes behind 
	her. A moment later we see the doorknob turn back and 
	forth. It's locked.

	EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

	On a fire escape, we see the ladder shake and descend to 
	the ground. The metal rattles back and forth as if 
	something were climbing it.

	We slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window. 
	Through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see 
	Linda enter the room. The panel of glass fogs from 
	Sebastian's breath. The fog wipes away, seemingly by 
	itself.

	But then through the window we see Matt walk into the 
	living room and put his arms around Linda's waist. We 
	hear a shocked intake of air.

	He kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress. Her 
	dress falls to the floor. Matt takes off his sport coat 
	and drapes it over a chair, while Linda unfastens the 
	buttons of his shirt. They're laughing now, exchanging 
	kisses.

	Matt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra. He kisses 
	his way down her neck to her breasts. Linda pulls him to 
	her.

	Suddenly the window shatters. Startled, both Matt and 
	Linda jump back covering themselves.

	We hear Sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the 
	fire escape.

	A moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out. He 
	sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down 
	below.

				LINDA
			What was it?

				MATT
			I don't know. I don't see anything. 

	Matt picks up a piece of glass and examines it.

				MATT (cont'd)
			It's like something hit it.

	Linda picks up the phone and dials.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

	Carter picks up the phone.

				CARTER
			Hello?

	Carter looks at the security monitor of the recovery 
	room. Sebastian's heat signature lies still on the bed.

				CARTER (cont'd)
			No. No. He's here No, I'm staring at 
			him. He's right there in his room.

	INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Linda breathes a sigh of relief.

				LINDA
			Thanks. No, just checking. 'Kay, bye.
				 (hangs up phone)
			Phew.

	Matt pulls her into him.

				MATT
			Relax... it's nothing. Where were we?

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

	BARKING can be heard in the background. That horrible 
	repetitive barking that grates the soul like Chinese 
	water torture.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Be quiet!

	A photograph of Linda drifts through the air and settles 
	atop a flaming candle. It ignites into fire, twisting and 
	turning in mid-air, then falling on the floor as ash. A 
	beat later water runs from the sink faucet. It forms in 
	the shape of hands and splashes against his face, 
	dripping away.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			And the cyclops screamed out, "Who is 
			it who blinds me?" and Odysseus 
			replied "Nobody is my name". And the 
			Cyclops raged to his friends "Nobody 
			is killing me. Nobody".

	The barking continues. A moment later the chamber door 
	slides open. We push down the...

	HALLWAY OF THE HABITATS

	... until we are face-to-face with the unhappy barking 
	dog.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Shhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing.

	The Plexiglas door to the doggie's cage swings open and 
	some invisible force grabs little doggie around the neck. 
	The force squeezes its little fur ball throat until the 
	barking stops.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Nobody's gonna hurt you. 

	The force keeps squeezing until the little doggie goes 
	limp. Then the dog smashes against the Plexiglas over and 
	over until blood spills out its mouth. The Plexiglas door 
	swings closed again and moments later the door to 
	Sebastian's cubicle closes as well. The water runs in 
	Sebastian's sink washing the blood away from his now half 
	visible hands.

								
	DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HABITAT'S CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING

	Sarah sees the dead dog lying prone on its bedding. She 
	eyes it curiously and opens the cage door.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - LATER

	Sarah stares at the empty chamber.

				SARAH
			You awake?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I am now.

	The sheets raise and drape off of him.

				SARAH
			Notice anything unusual last night. 

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			No. Why?

				SARAH
			Franklin Three. He's dead.

	Sebastian pulls a sheet around him. He moves across the 
	dimly lit room like a ghost.

				SEBASTIAN
			What of?

				SARAH
			His neck was broken and his windpipe 
			collapsed.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			How'd that happen?

				SARAH
			I thought maybe you could tell me.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Sarah... You saying I had something to 
			do with it?

				SARAH
			He was alive last night when I left 
			and he was dead this morning. And you 
			were the only one down here.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I was in my room all night.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

	Sarah sits with Carter as they run through the security 
	video tape. Matt and Linda look over their shoulder.

				CARTER
			That's all twelve hours.

				LINDA
			He never left the room.

				SARAH
			A windpipe doesn't just suddenly 
			collapse. Someone or something killed 
			it.

				MATT
			You saw the tape. The man was in his 
			chamber.

				SARAH
			Then we have a problem, because I the 
			cage was locked from the outside. That 
			means it was opened, the dog was 
			killed and the cage was closed and 
			locked again. Only a human could do 
			that.

				CARTER
			Well, it wasn't me.

				MATT
			And it wasn't him.

				LINDA
			Are we sure?

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - NIGHT

	Linda passes Sebastian's chamber. Sebastian's in latex.

				SEBASTIAN
			Any big plans for tonight?

				LINDA
			Quiet night at home. Maybe a book.

				SEBASTIAN
			Really? Whatever happened to that guy 
			your were seeing?

				LINDA
			He's still in the picture. Why?

				SEBASTIAN
			Being locked down here, I'm forced to 
			live vicariously. Someday you'll have 
			to tell me what he's like.

				LINDA
			Maybe someday I will. See you in the 
			morning.

				SEBASTIAN
			Au domain.

	Sebastian watches Linda walk away. He glances at the 
	camera and starts to peel off his face.

	INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	The elevator door opens. It's empty.

	SEBASTIAN'S POV - as we push past the guard and down onto 
	the street.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Empty street. We hear whistling. Splashes of water splat 
	out from shallow puddles,,as Sebastian walks through 
	them.

	SEBASTIAN'S POV - A car approaches. As it drives by we 
	see Matt and Linda inside, heading back to the warehouse.

	The footsteps stop.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Hmmm.

	We see the footsteps start to head back toward the 
	warehouse.

	INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	Linda and Matt exit their car and cross toward the 
	elevator.

				LINDA
				 (to Marine Guard)
			Forgot something.

	INT. STREET IN FRONT OF WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

	As we watch the footsteps head back through the puddles 
	toward the warehouse, we see Frank pass us in his car.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			What the hell?

	He breaks into a run. Feet splash water and he races back 
	toward the warehouse.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Empty. The elevator door opens and we push out into the 
	hallway. Sebastian's POV

	INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT

	We follow Sebastian down the hallway to his cubicle. But 
	as he rounds the corner, he quickly ducks back. The 
	entire research team is in his cubicle. Sebastian slowly 
	approaches and watches as Frank takes down his video 
	board.

				FRANK
			Pretty clever really. All it does is 
			recycle the signal. He flips this 
			switch, it takes a snapshot and that's 
			all we see.

				LINDA
			Asshole.

				JANICE
			And you think he's violent?

				SARAH
			He killed a dog with his bare hands.

				FRANK
			Dogs aren't people. Are we in any 
			danger?

	Linda doesn't know.

				LINDA
			Either way, we aren't equipped to 
			handle this. We have to inform the 
			committee.

	Everybody murmurs in agreement.

				JANICE
			What if he doesn't come back?

				LINDA
			They'll go after him.
				 (beat)
			Who has tonight's shift?

				JANICE
			I do.

				LINDA
			Pretend nothing's wrong. Everyone just 
			do what you're doing so he doesn't 
			become suspicious. Okay? Matt and I'll 
			go tell Doctor Kramer and we'll lot 
			the committee deal with it. 

	Sebastian's POV - He backs away and races down the hall.

	EXT. DR. KRAMER'S HOUSE - POTOMAC MD - NIGHT

	The stately stone house sits on a finely manicured lawn 
	in one of the nicest neighborhoods in town. Linda's car 
	is parked on the curb in front.

	We break from a typical establishing shot and as the 
	CAMERA tracks closer to the house, we realize that we are

	SEBASTIAN'S POV

	We hear breathing and footsteps as we push through some 
	bushes and head toward a bay window which looks into the 
	Kramer living room.

	Through the glass we see LINDA and MATT seated across 
	from DR. KRAMER. We can't hear what they're saying but it 
	certainly looks serious. Kramer puffs on a pipe and 
	strokes his beard, shaking his head.

	Kramer rises and shakes hands with Linda and Matt, and 
	the three of them head toward the front door.

	We move away from the window and track toward the front 
	door. As the door opens we begin to hear the tail end of 
	the conversation.

				KRAMER
			I'll call General Caster right now and 
			convene the oversight committee 
			tomorrow.

				LINDA
			Thank you, sir.

				MATT
			What do we do in the meantime?

				KRAMER
			Just sit tight and wait for my call. 

	Matt and Linda head down to her car. Kramer heads back 
	inside.

	INT. KRAMER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	Kramer heads back into the living room. His wife appears 
	a the upstairs railing.

				MRS. KRAMER
			What was that about?

				KRAMER
			Just a little trouble at work.

				MRS. KRAMER
			You coming up?

				KRAMER
			In a minute. I have to make a few 
			calls.

	Mrs. Kramer retreats back to her bedroom as Dr. Kramer 
	crosses over to the telephone. He picks up the receiver 
	and starts dialing. In the middle of dialing, the phone 
	goes dead. He clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to 
	get a dial tone. Nothing. He checks the connections on 
	the phone and then follows the wiring to the wall. The 
	line's plugged in. Weird. He hears a door creak open in 
	the kitchen.

				KRAMER (cont'd)
			Hello? Hello?

	Kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen. The kitchen door 
	leading to the backyard is open. Puzzled, he crosses to 
	it. A wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling 
	dead leaves in small twists of wind. The windchime rings 
	lightly. Kramer steps out.

	EXT. POOL/PATIO, BACKYARD - NIGHT

	In the dim spillover light from house, Kramer crosses to 
	the telephone- box against the back of the house. It Is 
	open and several of the wires have been pulled. He looks 
	around, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his 
	pipe. For the briefest of instants, Sebastian's face is 
	visible in the smoke. Kramer jumps back in surprise and 
	the pipe drops from his mouth. He gives a small sharp 
	cry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and 
	his cries are stifled. In the darkness, we can make out 
	his form writhing as if possessed. The struggle continues 
	a beat until Kramer manages to break free.

				KRAMER
			Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!

	As Kramer runs, he looks behind him. But no one's there. 
	WHAM! Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles, rolling 
	into the pool. But as he hits water there's not just one 
	splash, but TWO. In the water next to him is human shaped 
	AIR-POCKET. It's Sebastian displacing the water. And 
	because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two 
	arms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface. 

	MARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at 
	the pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his 
	flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around 
	him. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails 
	for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A 
	moment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR 
	POCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the 
	pool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of 
	water. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall 
	until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of 
	tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the 
	light like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree. The shape 
	disappears into the darkness. A moment later Martha 
	emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face 
	down in the pool. She screams.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY

	Linda passes by Sebastian's chamber.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			What? No good morning for me? Don't 
			you like me anymore?

				LINDA
			Oh, sorry. I...I'm in a hurry.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			That's okay. It's going to be busy 
			day.

	INT. LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY

	Matt sits across from her, twirling a pen in his hand. 
	They both stare at the phone.

				LINDA
			When did he say held call?

				MATT
			He's probably meeting with the 
			committee trying to figure out what to 
			do.

				LINDA
			I'm gonna call him.

	Linda picks up the phone and dials.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Yes, Dr. Kramer please. Excuse me?
				 (inhales sharply - surprised)
			When? I'm so sorry.

	Linda blanches as she hangs up the phone.

				MATT
			What?

				LINDA
			He's dead. Drowned in his pool last 
			night.

	Linda picks up the phone again and dials.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Yes, General Thompson please. Thank 
			you. 

	As she waits the phone line clicks dead.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Hello? Hello?

	She clicks on the hookswitch.

				MATT
			Let me see that.

	He tries it too. Same result.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Intercom's working, but there doesn't 
			seem to be an outside line.

	INT. CORRIDOR/ELEVATOR

	They waste no time getting to the elevator. Linda and 
	Matt step in.

				LINDA
			I'll be right back with help.

	Linda taps in his floor code.

				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization please.

				LINDA
			Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.

				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization invalid. Request denied.

				LINDA
			That's a first.

	Linda taps the keypad again.

				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization please.

				LINDA
			Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.

				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization invalid. Request denied.

				MATT
			Let me try mine.

	Matt hits buttons on the keypad.

				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization please.

				MATT
			Kensington Two Romeo One Five Nine.

				ELEVATOR (V.0.)
			Authorization invalid. Request denied.

				LINDA
			Tell me this isn't happening.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Frank, Sarah, Carter and Janice man various work stations 
	in the lab. Linda and Matt enter.

				LINDA
			We've got a problem.

	INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

	Frank's fingers fly over the keyboard.

				MATT
			How long before anybody starts looking 
			for us?

				LINDA
			There's no set check in procedure. It 
			could be weeks.

	A graphic of the elevator system pops up on the screen. 
	Frank highlights the security terminal. Frank hits a few 
	more keys. The screen reduces to a series of numbers.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			You think you can got in?

	Frank rewrites a few of the numbers.

				FRANK
			Already in. It was only a second level 
			encryption.

	The Security System specifications pops up.

				JANICE
			Some security system.

				FRANK
			Oh the system is fine. It's just I'm 
			just extraordinary.

	Frank types a few more keys, and his eyes widen.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			But apparently someone is more 
			extraordinary than me.

				MATT
			What is it?

				FRANK
			There's nothing wrong with the system. 
			Our codes have been removed.

				MATT
			Removed? By who?

				FRANK
			Here's a clue. Only one code remains. 

				LINDA
			Whose?

				FRANK
			Dr. Sebastian Caine.

	INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER

	The team approaches Sebastian's chamber. Carter pulls on 
	the pair of thermal goggles dangling from his neck up.

	THERMAL POV - The chamber is empty.

				CARTER
			He's not in there.

	Linda enters the chamber. She notes that Sebastian's face 
	and makeup are on the sink vanity. Linda crosses to the 
	phone and hits the "PAGE BUTTON"

				LINDA
			Okay, Sebastian. Fun's over. Tell us 
			where you are.

	She waits. Then...

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I'm sorry. But I can't lot you turn me 
			in.

				LINDA
			Sebastian... where are you?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)
			You have no idea what it's like. The 
			power of it. The freedom. I can't let 
			that go.

				LINDA
			C'mon Sebastian. You're scaring me. 
			Tell me where you are and we can talk 
			about it.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (INTERCOM)
			There's nothing to talk about. See ... 
			I've done things that can't be undone. 

	A long beep as the intercom clicks off.

				LINDA
			Sebastian! Sebastian!
				 (beat)
			I want search parties. Thermal goggles 
			and tranquilizers.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Linda and Matt, wearing thermal goggles and clutching 
	tranquilizer pistols, walk down the hallway, scanning 
	back and forth.

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

	Janice enters the office.

				JANICE
			Dr. Caine? Are you in here? Dr. Caine? 

	Suddenly, Janice jerks back.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I'm here.

	INT. HABITAT'S CORRIDOR

	Sarah scans all the habitats with a thermal scanner. 
	Listening intently.

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

	Janice struggles with her unseen assailant, slamming into 
	walls and knocking into filing cabinets.

	INT. LABORATORY

	Frank and Carter search the lab with their thermal 
	scopes.

				FRANK
			Doctor Caine?

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

	Linda and Matt knock.

				LINDA
			Sebastian?

	No response. They push through the door. The room seems 
	deserted. Signs of a struggle. File cabinets opened, 
	drawers tossed.

				MATT
			This is bad.

	THERMAL POV - Linda surveys the room, spotting a slight 
	heat signature peeking from the corner.

				LINDA
			There's something over there.

	Linda moves toward it. Whatever it is its hidden from 
	Matt's POV by the supply cabinet. As Linda gets close she 
	pulls of f her thermal goggles to see...

	JANICE -

	Her face blue, eyes bulging. An I.V. cord wrapped around 
	his neck. Linda jumps back.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Jesus. Oh my god.

	Matt rushes over. Sees the lifeless corpse.

				MATT
			What happened?

	Linda lowers the body to the floor.

				LINDA
			She was strangled. Multiple blows to 
			her head.

	Linda begins a medical check of the rest of the body. 
	Matt stoops down and examines Janice's face.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			We got a big problem here.

	A lamp tumbles from the desk and smashes to the floor. 
	Both Linda and Matt jump. Linda frantically dons the 
	thermal visor and scopes the room again. Nothing. Matt 
	notices the lamp cord beneath Linda's leg. Points it out 
	to her. She sighs with relief... she pulled the lamp off 
	the table.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Get everybody to the conference room. 
			Now!

	Matt picks up the phone. Clicks the hookswitch. Clicks 
	the hookswitch again.

				MATT
			Intercom... the phone lines. They're 
			dead.

				LINDA
			Gimme that.

	She checks the phone, punches some numbers. Nothing.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			It was just working.

				MATT
			What the fuck is going on here?

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Matt and Linda head toward the lab.

	Linda suddenly stops.

				MATT
			What?

				LINDA
			Shhh.

	Linda takes a few cautious steps. Senses something.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Give me the visor.

	Matt, suddenly concerned, hands her the visor. 

	THERMAL POV - Linda checks out the corridor. Empty. Linda 
	takes Matt's hand.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			C'mon.

	They move quickly up the corridor. See Frank, Sarah and 
	Carter.

				FRANK
			Did you find him?

				LINDA
			Janice is dead.

	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

	Linda scans the room with her thermal scope.

				LINDA
			It's clear.

	Matt, Frank, Janice and Sarah step in, locking the door 
	behind them.

				SARAH
			The man has checked out of reality.

				FRANK
			What happened? I don't understand.

				CARTER
			Isn't it obvious? Right now, we're the 
			only ones who knows he exists. If he 
			gets rid of us, no one knows and he 
			becomes the most powerful man on 
			earth.

				FRANK
			But he's not a killer.

	They all look at Linda.

				LINDA
			He wasn't. He is now.

				MATT
			Can you fix the elevator? Restore our 
			codes?

				FRANK
			It'd take hours to crack the 
			encryptions.

				MATT
			Right now that sounds like good news.

				CARTER
			So what do we do until then. Sit 
			around waiting for him to kill us off? 

	Everyone looks around for some leadership. Finally.

				LINDA
			No. We find him, before he finds us.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	The group moves quickly, passing under an air vent. As 
	they round the corner the vent slowly swings down and an 
	air disturbance drops to the ground.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	As they enter...

				CARTER
			You sure this'll work.

	Linda sits down at a computer terminal, activates it.

				LINDA
			We designed it to help find the rats 
			we kept dropping in year one. They 
			were too small for thermal scans.

	A map of the compound appears on the screen.

				MATT
			Systems hot. Activating motion 
			detectors.

	Matt toggles a switch. Linda stares at a map of the 
	compound. Blips appear on the display... in the 
	observation room... in the Habitat Area and in one of the 
	corridors.

				LINDA
			I've got movement in Corridor Six.

				MATT
			That's him.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	A shadow edges down the tunnel. It settles for a moment, 
	disappearing completely, then is back on the move. At the 
	tunnel's edges, motion detectors light up as the thing 
	passes by.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	Carter checks his Tranq pistol & Matt rummages through a 
	locker.

				MATT
			Got 'em.

	Matt pulls out a pair of walkie-talkies. He tosses one to 
	Linda.

				LINDA
				 (into walkie)
			Check. Check.

	Her voice echoes from the other unit.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Be careful.

				MATT
			Just watch our backs. Hey Carter, 
			ready?

				CARTER
			Let's do it.

	Matt and Carter exit. Linda locks the door behind them.

	INT. TUNNEL

	Matt and Carter trot toward corridor six.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

	Linda huddles over the display, tracking the two.

				LINDA
				 (into Walkie)
			Take a right at the next accessway. 
			He's working his way back to the 
			offices.

	We see Matt and Carter on one of the working video 
	screens as they push down the tunnel.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Matt and Carter move cautiously, listening for any sound.

				MATT
				 (Walkie - sotto)
			If we split up, can we trap him on 
			corridor eight?

				LINDA (V.0.)
			If he keeps heading in that direction. 

	Matt nods to Carter. The pair splits, heading down 
	separate accessways.

				MATT
			Going Thermal.

	Matt pulls the visor down over his eyes.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

	Linda watches the two separate and come around Sebastian 
	in a pincer move.

	Suddenly, the blip that was Sebastian disappears. Linda 
	grabs the walkie.

				LINDA
			I lost him. Matt, I lost him.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Matt makes his way forward.

				MATT
			He probably just stopped moving.

	But Matt becomes more cautious with his footsteps. Slowly 
	... approaching a corner...

	He rounds the corner and sees a heat signature at the far 
	end of the corridor. He levels his pistol, ready to fire.

				CARTER
			It's me.

	Matt pulls off his goggles.

				MATT
			Do you have anything?

				CARTER
			Nothing.

				MATT
			How did he get by us?

				CARTER
			He couldn't.

				MATT
			Sebastian! We're here to help. 
			Sebastian.

	No response. They both don their visors and move forward 
	slightly. Carter holds up his hand.

				CARTER
			There. Behind those pipes. He's not 
			moving.

	Carter points. Matt checks his thermal. A red heat 
	signature clings to the wall.

				CARTER (cont'd)
			Doctor Caine?
				 (beat)
			Can you hear me?

	No response.

				MATT
				 (into walkie)
			We see him. But he's not responding. 
			The heat signature doesn't move.

	Matt looks through his visor and holds the tranquilizer 
	gun at the ready. He looks for a clear shot. The heat 
	signature huddles behind pipes.

				MATT
			C'mon... C'mon...

	The two slowly move closer. Matt finally has a clear 
	shot. He signals Carter. Carter levels his pistol too.

				CARTER
			Covered.

	Matt fires the dart at the heat signature. It bounces off 
	the wall ... Nothing there. 

				MATT
			What the...

	He crosses to the heat signature.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Just a vent. Just a goddamn vent

				LINDA (V.0.)
			He was there.

				MATT
			Looks like... looks like we're pumping 
			out heat...

	Suddenly behind him... CARTER JERKS THREE FEET in the 
	air, kicking wildly. SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR BY HIS NECK. He 
	gasps for air.

				LINDA (V.0.)
			I got movement again! He's right on 
			top of you!

				MATT
			No fucking shit!

	Matt opens fire with the tranquilize, shooting at the 
	ceiling until he spends his dart rounds.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Sebastian? Goddamnit! Let him go.

				CARTER
				 (choking)
			H...Help... MMmmphg

	Carter suffocates. He passes out. With a sudden crack, 
	he's thrown against the side wall. A large cut opens up 
	across his head and his body goes limp.

				MATT
				 (into walkie)
			Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!?

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

	Linda huddles over the display.

				LINDA
			Right on top of you.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Matt scrambles away. Running. Pipes burst and swing down 
	from the ceiling. Steam billows forth. Something moves 
	through the cloud of steam.

	Around the corner, Matt shoves more darts into his 
	tranquilizer.

				LINDA (V.0.)
			What's going on? Are you okay?

				MATT
			Carter's down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from 
			a head wound.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Linda watches the screen. Two blips, one traveling 
	quickly.

				LINDA
			Matt, he's coming toward you.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Matt takes a few steps back.

				MATT
			Shit.

				LINDA
			Got outta there.

	Matt breaks into a run.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	Linda watches one dot chasing the other, down several 
	corridors.

				LINDA
			He's close!

	INT. TUNNEL

	Matt running, checking over his shoulder. Sounds of 
	footsteps behind him, but up ahead the heavy metal blast 
	doors begin to close.

				MATT
			Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He's 
			shutting me in.

	Matt rushes the doors as they slide shut. He doesn't make 
	it in time. The doors close with a resounding clang. Matt 
	turns and pulls on his thermals.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Where is he?

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Linda huddled over the screen. Tense.

				LINDA
			He's coming right at you! 

	Then checks the Thermal goggles. Several heat signature 
	dot the tunnel.

				MATT
			Where?

				LINDA
			Twenty, maybe thirty feet.

				MATT
			Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the 
			place. Eight, maybe ten of them. Must 
			be ghosts.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Linda gets a sense of forboding. She looks around the 
	room. Sees a heating vent in the corner.

	Beat.

	She grabs the walkie.

				LINDA
			Those signatures ... they're coming 
			from the heating vents. 

	Through the goggles, Matt sees the tunnel turning red.

				MATT
			I'm starting to lose resolution on my 
			thermals.

				LINDA
			Get out of there!

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

				FRANK
			If the room temperature is the same as 
			his body temperature, thermal 
			visors'll be no good.

	Linda grabs a Tranq gun and heads for the door. 

				LINDA
			I'm going!

				FRANK
			Linda...it's not safe.

				LINDA
			That's why I'm going.
				 (to Frank and Sarah)
			Corridor eight is clear. Get Carter to 
			the lab. We'll meet you there.

				FRANK
			But...

				LINDA
			Do it.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Matt turns to face the corridor. It's turning red. Matt 
	sees some movement in the thermal cloud. Opens fire. But 
	the thermal signature disappears into the heat. Matt 
	can't distinguish anything through his goggles anymore. 
	He pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him 
	sweeping the hallway.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Marco...Polo... Marco... Polo...

	His voice keeps shifting. Matt fires.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			Not even close.

	Matt sweeps his front leg back and forth, like a blind 
	man using a cane. But his foot isn't hitting anything. He 
	sees a FIRE EXTINGUISHER mounted on the wall. He rushes 
	it, turns it on the hallway and sprays. And SOMETHING 
	LUNGES through the foam. GRABS HIM, sending him tumbling 
	down the tunnel. Matt is thrown against the wall. Blood 
	coming from his brow. He scrambles away, spraying more 
	foam. Sees a shape in the mist, raises his pistol and 
	FIRES. The shape leaps away. The DART FLIES. Doesn't hit. 
	Matt scrambles back into a corner. His pistol is empty.

				SEBASTIAN
			So... just out of curiosity, how long 
			has my best friend been fucking my ex-
			girlfriend.

				MATT
			Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You 
			aren't thinking rationally.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			She's a pretty sweet fuck, isn't she?

				MATT
			Calm down, Sebastian... we can talk 
			this through. It's not too late.

	The Shape parts the low hanging mist, the fine powder 
	swirling in clouds behind it. Coming toward him.

				MATT (CONT'D)
			C'mon Sebastian. Don't do this. I'm 
			your friend.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I'm sorry, but I just feel that our 
			friendship is holding me back. I'm 
			sure you understand. 

	THE DOOR OPENS. Linda reaches through, grabs Matt. She 
	pulls him to his feet and through the door.

	INT. TUNNEL

	Frank and Sarah, holding their Tranq pistols, fly down 
	the corridor.

				SARAH
			This way.

	They shear off the main corridor into the side corridor. 
	Carter lies crumpled up ahead. Sarah slides to his side. 
	Carter's head rests in a pool of blood. She checks his 
	pulse while Frank takes a protective position.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Pulse is weak. Breathing... shallow.

				FRANK
			He'll be okay.

				SARAH
			It's pretty severe. We have to get him 
			to the lab.

				FRANK
			He's got to be okay.

	Frank stands frozen.

				SARAH
			For godsakes, help me.

	Frank snaps to. Grabs an arm. The pair hoist Carter up 
	and carry him down the hallway.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM

	Linda pulls a handle and doors slide shut behind them.

				MATT
			He was going to kill me.

	Linda pulls him close.

				LINDA
			I know. He's gone.

				MATT
			We've got to got out of here.

	Linda checks the screen -- see Sarah, Frank and Carter 
	headed toward the Laboratory.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Where is he? Goddamnit, where is he? 

	Isolated in the Hallway of Habitats is a single blip.

				LINDA
			Habitats.

				MATT
			Oh god. That's right between us and 
			the lab.

	INT. LABORATORY

	Frank and Sarah lift Carter onto a medical table.

				SARAH
			His pulse is faint.

	Sarah grabs a sheet from the counter top. Folds it and 
	presses it against the head wound.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			He's lost a lot of blood. Here. Hold 
			this.

	She guides Frank's hands to the wound.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Keep applying pressure.

	Sarah pulls out a saline solution I.V. bag and slap it on 
	the rack. She fumbles with the needle as she tries to 
	find a vein.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Don't move your hand until I got back. 

	Sarah heads to the door.

				FRANK
			Where are you going?

				SARAH
			This'll hold him but he needs blood.

				FRANK
			But...

				SARAH
			Supply is right down the hall. I'll be 
			two seconds.

				FRANK
			Sarah, wait for the others

				SARAH
			If I wait, he'll die. Keep pressure on 
			the wound.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Sarah exits the lab. Checks the corridor. Down at the end 
	of the cramped tunnel is the supply room.

	She swallows her fear and heads toward it, all the while 
	glancing side-to-side and behind her.

	INT. SUPPLY ROOM

	Spooked, Sarah bursts into the room. She goes to the 
	supply fridge/freezer, pulls open the door, and sorts 
	through blood bags.

	INT. TUNNEL

	Matt and Linda push along the corridor; Matt spraying 
	with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts, 
	Linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando.

	A noise behind them. Footsteps.

	Matt turns to blast with the extinguisher. The white 
	chemical dust sprays out, outlining a shape in the 
	tunnel. But it isn't a human shape.

	Matt's uniform shreds. Something with fierce sharp claws 
	fells him. Tearing into his flesh. We see a angry, hungry 
	face... jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog.

				MATT
			Ahh!  Shit!

	Linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke. 
	Matt trips and goes sprawling. Something yelps. A howl. 
	Linda shoots. Her dart jabs into something which 
	collapses to the ground. A moment of calm. As the dusty 
	chemical foam settles, the outline of a great ape 
	appears, still twitching.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Karl Three. Nice shot.

				LINDA
			He's let the animals out. It wasn't 
			him we were tracking.

	Linda leans against the wall, still clutching her tranq 
	gun at the ready. The heat is getting to bar. Bar scrubs 
	are soaked, her hair's a mess. She wipes the sweat from 
	her brow.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			You okay?

				MATT
			It won't kill me unless it gets 
			infected. You?

				LINDA
			Me .... Don't ask about me. If he 
			freed all the animals, we could have 
			dozens running around the lab.

				MATT
			So he could be anywhere right now.

	Matt sprays the whole tunnel, putting down a gentle cloud 
	mist. Nothing else appears.

				MATT (cont'd)
			What do we do?

				LINDA
			Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors 
			and pray to God Frank can reprogram 
			the elevator.

	INT. SUPPLY ROOM

	Sarah finishes collecting blood bags and shuts the door 
	to the fridge/freezer.

	The DOOR SLAMS behind her. She freezes and slowly turns.

				SARAH
			Frank?

	She eyes the supply room, looking for a sign of movement.

				SARAH (cont'd)
				 (frightened whisper)
			Who's there?

	She listens. Is that breathing she hears? Now she's 
	starting to panic.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Dr. Caine?

	She starts to back away, but she's already in the corner. 
	She clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to 
	aim at. The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an 
	idea. She reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the 
	floor. GLASS SHATTERS and BLOOD SMEARS across the 
	linoleum. Sarah tosses another vial and another. Becoming 
	more and more hysterical. Splattering more and more 
	blood. But she runs out of vials. Shaking with fear, she 
	searches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement. 
	But there's nothing there. Sarah waits a beat, clutching 
	the tranquilizer gun. Takes a step. Waits a beat longer.

	Finally she relaxes. It was just her imagination. She 
	heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper 
	in her ear.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You missed.

	Her hair flies up, and she swings against the wall. She 
	tries to move, but she's pinned there. Her hands 
	struggling against the force.

				SARAH
			Please no. Let me go. Oh god, let me 
			go. 

	The arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			What are you doing? No!

	Sarah fights, but her arm moves nonetheless

				SARAH (cont'd)
			Help me! Oh God. Somebody help me!
			FRANK!

	Slowly, deliberately, her own arm moves down the wall and 
	around, until the tranquilizer gun points right at her 
	stomach.

	Sarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			No... please. Don't do this to me.

	She struggles, shaking back and forth. Writhing. In 
	anguish and in fear.

				SARAH (cont'd)
			What do you want?

				SEBASTIAN
			You.

	The trigger pulls .... Pop!

	A dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in Sarah's 
	stomach. She whimpers as her eyes glass over. Suddenly 
	she's released. She stumbles backward and falls lifeless 
	to the floor. A moment of stillness, all we can hear is 
	the sound of someone breathing.

	On Sarah's face... a slight-indentation runs down her 
	cheek..

	Almost sweet... almost tender. And slight indentation 
	runs across her breast and strokes down her body. The 
	sense of violation and vulnerability is awful. Sebastian 
	sighs.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I've always liked your feistiness. 

	Sarah's head shifts slightly. Her head shifts violently, 
	accompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping. 
	Sebastian exhales, his breath filled with the 
	intoxication of power.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Frank applies pressure to the wound, waiting for Sarah to 
	return. Carter's vital signs are weakening..,.

				FRANK
			Sarah! Sarah!
				 (to Carter)
			Goddamnit. Stay with me now. Don't you 
			let up... Sarah! Sarah!

	No response. Frank doesn't know whether to stay or go 
	after her. He starts toward the door several times but 
	can't leave Carter. Finally the door opens.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			Sarah! I'm losing him.

	But it's Linda and Matt.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			Did you see her?

	Linda rushes over to check on Carter.

				LINDA
			Where is she?

				FRANK
			She went to the supply room. Carter 
			needed blood.

	Linda grabs a stethoscope and listens to Carter's heart.

				LINDA
			I said no one goes anywhere alone.

				FRANK
			She didn't listen.

	She-slowly pulls Frank's hand away from the wound.

				FRANK (cont'd)
			But...

				LINDA
			He's dead.

	Linda would love to cry about it, but doesn't afford 
	herself the luxury.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	The three of them approach the supply room door slowly. 
	Blood trickles from under the door and bloody footprints 
	extend down the hallway.

	They swing open the door.

	The floor is covered in blood and broken glass. But no 
	body.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Sarah, broken, is dragged toward the chair, eerily 
	jerking down the hallway... seemingly on its own.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	The three scientists follow the bloody footprints down 
	the hallway past the empty cages in the tunnel of 
	habitats.

	All clutch their tranquilizer pistols.

	The footprints lead past the habitats to Sebastian's 
	chamber.

	They see Sarah's body in the dim light.

				LINDA
			Oh god. Sarah!

	The group breaks into a run. Linda pushes into the 
	chamber and falls at Sarah's side. Matt cradles Sarah's 
	head. They look for some sign of life as Linda fights 
	back the tears.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			No...

				FRANK
			Her too?

	Matt nods. Linda slams the cubicle wall with her fist.

				LINDA
			This didn't happen. This hasn't 
			happened.

				MATT
			It happened alright. Now we have to 
			deal with it.

	Matt puts his hands on her shoulder to calm her. She 
	pushes him off.

				FRANK
			Yeah? And just what are we supposed to 
			do now?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Now? Now you die.

	The three of them whip around.

				LINDA
			He's here!

				MATT
			Where?

				LINDA
			Sebastian!

	Silence. The three cautiously move out. They stand back 
	to back, each one facing out. They move toward the door 
	of the Chamber.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Sebastian. Sebastian, listen to me.

	No response. They all their tranq pistols level waiting 
	for some sign. Hearing each other breathe. They slowly 
	move outside the Chamber into the corridor.

				LINDA (CONT1D)
			I don't know if you can understand 
			this, but what you're experiencing is 
			a psychological breakdown. This isn't 
			who you are.

	A beat.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I would say that what I am 
			experiencing is psychological 
			awareness. I like you being in 
			complete and absolute control.

	They identify the general area the voice is coming from: 
	Back inside the Chamber! They slowly move toward the 
	Chamber door. With lightning speed they slam the door 
	shut, locking Sebastian inside the Recovery Chamber.

				LINDA
			You goddamn bastard! You goddamn 
			bastard. You're gonna pay for this. 
			I'm going to bring you back to 
			visibility and then I'm going throw 
			your ass in jail.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			You're never gonna bring me back 
			Linda. I never want to come back.

				LINDA
			Fuck you!

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Or maybe I'll fuck you. One last time 
			for old times sake.

	Linda slams her fist against the wall of the Chamber.

				MATT
			Don't listen to him. It's not worth 
			it.

				FRANK
			Come on, Matt. Let's go get the 
			elevator back on-line so we can got 
			out of this hell hole.

	Matt gives Linda a kiss...

				MATT
			He does anything, anything at all, 
			come get us. I'll be back to check on 
			you in five.

	Matt and Frank head off down the corridor.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Imagine you two, carrying on right 
			under my nose. Out of curiosity, what 
			did he give you that I couldn't?

				LINDA
			Shut up, Sebastian. He's more of a man 
			than you'll ever be.

	INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	A VIDEO SCREEN shows Linda pacing outside the Chamber 
	door. The chair moves forward toward a microphone.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Okay, sweetie. I'll be quiet. If 
			that's what you want...

	Sebastian TOGGLES the intercom switch OFF. We pan over to 
	one of the working video screens ... Matt and Frank 
	stride down the hallway. The chair swivels and the 
	observation room door swings open slightly.

	INT. CHAMBER

	Linda still holds his tranq gun toward the door. Nothing 
	moves. Nothing. Linda walks over to the Plexiglas ... 
	stares in. Can't see anything, anyone. Just the dead 
	Sarah.

	Then she sees it. The little red light on the intercom. 
	Its on.

				LINDA
			Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No...

	Linda bangs on the glass. She looks. No movement, no 
	nothing. She listens. Shit. She takes off running.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Matt! Frank! 

	Tracking with Linda as she rushes down the hall.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Matt! Matt! Frank!

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Linda breaks in the room to see Frank slicked in blood, 
	his throat cut, and Matt bleeding from multiple stab 
	wounds with an extension cord around his neck being 
	pulled tight.

				LINDA
			Jesus!

	Linda rushes over and slams into Matt. They fall to the 
	ground. Linda crawls over to Matt, but her head snaps 
	back and her lips erupt with blood.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			Figured it out? You were always so 
			clever.

	Matt's pulled back across the lab by the cord around his 
	neck. He grabs at the cord trying to breathe. Linda 
	watches him being pulled away.

				LINDA
			No!

	She clamors over to him. But Matt rises in the air and is 
	tossed against the lab table. Linda levels her dart 
	pistol and fires haphazardly at the air. She hits nothing 
	but objects jerk and move in a line as Sebastian heads 
	for cover. Linda manages to grab Matt and pull him to 
	her.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Hang on!

				MATT
			Get out of here!

	Linda pulls Matt toward the door.

				LINDA
				 (yelling)
			You won't get away with this. They'll 
			find out about you. They'll hunt you 
			down.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			The villagers with their torches? Lock 
			up your daughters! Sorry, Lin. It's 
			not gonna happen that way.

	Linda hits the lights. The lab is now very, very dark.

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE (cont'd)
			See, I've spent all my time down here 
			thinking up this plan. When they find 
			you, they'll find a pile of charred 
			corpses. The result of a terrible 
			accident, I'm afraid.

	Linda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer. She 
	navigates the maze of equipment, heading toward the crack 
	of light at the front door.

				LINDA
			How can you be so brutal?

				SEBASTIAN'S VOICE
			I guess because I don't have to look 
			at myself in the mirror anymore
				 (beat)
			Remember that first night I was out? I 
			did something bad, just to see if I 
			could get away with it. And when I 
			did, I realized I could have it all. I 
			can kill in broad daylight. And 
			nobody's gonna tell the police they 
			were fucked by a ghost. Anything I 
			desire I can make happen, but not if 
			people know.

	Linda and Matt have reached the door of the lab. She 
	pushes through it and slams it behind her.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Linda pulls Matt along.

				MATT
			I'm dizzy. I can't feel my legs.

				LINDA
			Just keep going. I'll fix you later.

	INT. CORRIDOR, LAB DOORS - DAY

	The doors explode open.

	INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY

	Linda looks up and down the hall and pulls Matt inside 
	the supply room. It's still blood soaked from earlier.

	Linda closes the door, sliding the deadbolt into place.

	Linda lots him drop like a heap onto the floor. She falls 
	to her knees beside Matt, lying on the ground.

				LINDA
			Matt... Matthew. Stay with me now. 

	Linda pulls his scrubs open. The wounds are many and 
	deep.

				MATT
			He surprised us. We weren't 
			expecting...

				LINDA
			Shhh. Don't talk.

	BAM! Something slams against the door. Bam! Slams against 
	it again. The old deadbolt is buckling. Linda looks 
	around the room and sees the storage freezer.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			We gotta move. Hang on.

	Linda helps Matt up and into the storage freezer.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda grabs a metal bar and slides it between two hooks 
	on the door and the jam.

	BAM! The storage room door blows open. Linda leans down 
	next to Matt.

				MATT
			Lin...

	He entire shirt is stained with blood. He's having 
	trouble breathing.

				MATT (cont'd)
			I can't feel anything.

	Linda picks up his hand. Grips it tight.

				LINDA
			You feel that?

	Matt smiles.

				MATT
			A little...

	She rips his shirt open... and sees his wounds. She grabs 
	a vial of alcohol and dumps it on her hands and then 
	probes the wound.

				LINDA
			Your losing blood, but he didn't hit 
			the vitals.

	She looks around.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			Sutures and thread.

	She rises, and looks outside the porthole into the room. 
	Suddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face. She 
	stumbles backward, and the door starts rattling. Linda 
	scrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place. 
	Sebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door. To no 
	avail. It's not gonna budge. Finally he gives up. The 
	door stops shaking. Linda is relieved, briefly.  Still. 
	Then she hears the click of the door locking.

	OUTSIDE THE FREEZER

	CLOSE ON THE REGULATOR as the dial turns from forty-five 
	degrees, down to negative twenty.

	INSIDE THE FREEZER

	Through the porthole, Linda sees the bloody footprints 
	heading toward the door. She removes the metal bar and 
	pushes on the door. It won't move.

				LINDA
			Goddamnit.

	Linda looks around the storage room. She grabs a roll of 
	duct tape and pulls off a length.

				MATT
			What're you doing?

				LINDA
			This is temporary.

	She takes paper towel and cleans off Matt's wound. She 
	tapes it, using duct tape.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			You still with me?

				MATT
			Barely.

	A beat later, the compressor begins pumping Arctic air 
	into the freezer.

				LINDA
			Just keeps getting worse.

	Linda returns to the door. Shakes it.

	INT. CHAMBER - DAY

	We hear WHISTLING as we see a sheet of flesh fill out 
	into a head as Sebastian slides on his latex head piece.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda continues shaking the door. The lock holds. A tear 
	rolls down Linda's cheek, but a strange thing happens. 
	The tear drops freeze. Linda shivers as she pulls the icy 
	tears from her face.

				LINDA
			Oh shit.

	The inside thermometer has dropped to five degrees.

	Linda grabs the metal bar and starts smashing it against 
	the porthole. The metal bar just bounces off the glass.

	INT. SEBASTIAN'S OFFICE

	A drawer opens, revealing a set of clothing neatly 
	folded. Shirt, pants, shoes. They begin to move.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda drops the metal bar and slides down the wall, 
	defeated.

				MATT
			There's no way out.

				LINDA
			There's got to be.

				MATT
			They say freezing to death isn't so 
			bad. You just kinda pass out.

	Matt's head rolls back.

				LINDA
			Matt! MATT!

	She checks his pulse. Thank god he still has one, but 
	he's not gonna last long. They're both already starting 
	to turn a little blue. Linda stares desperately up at the 
	shelves, trying to find some sort of advantage. Then she 
	sees something. She looks back at the door lock and then 
	she rises ... and grabs AN EXTENSION CORD coiled on the 
	shelf.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			We're not dying in here.


	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

	Sebastian, dressed in street clothes, stands before the 
	mirror applying make-up to his latex mask.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda finishes stripping the insulation off the electric 
	cord. 

	She grabs a hypodermic needle package, and her cold 
	fingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out 
	the plastic tube.

	She finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the 
	stripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil.

	INT. BATHROOM - DAY

	Sebastian slides on a wig and checks his appearance in 
	the mirror. Pretty smooth. Even from relatively close up, 
	he could pass as normal.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda furiously winds wire into a coil.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Sebastian heads down the corridor. Lingering steam twists 
	in and around the hallway, long wispy tendrils. Sebastian 
	pauses for a moment, hearing A GROWL. Suddenly the 
	hallway seems a lot scarier. From beneath his scrubs he 
	pulls his own tranq gun. He listens ... hearing scraping 
	and footsteps. Watching the water on the floor twitch. 
	With machine like precision, he turns and fires. The 
	tranq dart halts in mid-air and some invisible thing 
	tumbles over.

	Sebastian continues down the hallway.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda holds the plug end of the extension cord. The other 
	end is wrapped into a tight long coil. Linda looks for an 
	outlet, but can't find one. She looks at the overhead 
	lights.

	A moment later she's climbing up the shelving. She wrap* 
	a piece of fabric around her hand, and with a sharp punch 
	she smashes one of the overhead light bulbs.

	INT. LABORATORY

	Sebastian enters, fully dressed. At a distance it'd be 
	hard to tell his secret. He pulls several chemicals off 
	the shelves. Then he pulls a tray of test tubes over and 
	begins mixing.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda works on jerry rigging the two ends of the wire to 
	the lightbulb, socket. 
	Suddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies 
	against the nearest metal surface. She's made an 
	electromagnet.

	INT. LABORATORY

	Sebastian loads the filled test tubes into the 
	centrifuge. Dozens of other vials are already slotted. He 
	takes one of the left over vials, considers it a moment 
	and then flings it over to the other side of the lab. The 
	vial shatters and...

	EXPLODES.

	A powerful explosion that rocks the room.

	INT. STORAGE FREEZER

	Linda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up 
	against the door. The magnet attaches itself. Linda 
	shakes the coil, trying to get the doorlock to move.

	OUTSIDE THE DOOR -

	We see the lock twitching. Shaking...

	INSIDE THE DOOR -

	Linda shivers as she plays with the coil. Her eyes glaze 
	and she stumbles backward. Her surgical scrubs, once 
	soaked with sweat, are now frozen stiff. She composes 
	herself and pushes back toward the door. Her heavy breath 
	hangs as a low cloud of Mist.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Sebastian looks over the dozens of other test tubes, 
	calculating their combined power in his mind. Then he 
	closes the top of the centrifuge. He taps a few commands 
	into its timer.

	INT. SUPPLY ROOM

	The door lock twitches again and twists back. The door 
	swings opens and Linda stumbles out, mashing into a 
	supply shelf of oxygen canisters. The canisters tumble 
	every which way as Linda tumbles to the ground.

	She scrambles to her feet and goes in after Matt, pulling 
	his cold body out of the storage locker.

	She pulls stacks of paper down from, the shelves into a 
	trashcan, grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the 
	paper. She pushes Matt close to the small bonfire. As she 
	does, the oxygen tanks catch her eye.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Sebastian exits the lab, locking the door behind him. He 
	heads down the darkened tunnel. Something scampers in 
	front of him. Small, not visible. Sebastian sends it 
	reeling with a swift violent kick.

	INT. CORRIDOR, BY THE ELEVATOR - DAY

	Sebastian, dressed and in full latex, comes striding up 
	the tunnel. He taps a code into the elevator vault doors. 
	The vault doors open revealing the elevator.

	The doors slide open and Sebastian steps inside.

				ELEVATOR
			Authorization please?

				SEBASTIAN
			Caine. One One One One One.

				ELEVATOR
			Authorization valid. Thank you.

				LINDA
			Sebastian!

	And there's Linda. Slicked with dirt and blood. She holds 
	a oxygen container with a cut line.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			I can't let you leave. Come on out and 
			I'll give you one last chance.

				SEBASTIAN
			You said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn't 
			hold on to the past.

	The door starts to shut.

				LINDA
			Aaaaaaahhhh!

	She hits the top of a LIGHTER duct-taped to the hose. A 
	line of PRESSURIZED FIRE BLOWS into the elevator. 
	WWHHHOOOOSSHHHH! Sebastian goes up in flame. Linda runs 
	toward the elevator. Just as the door's about to close, 
	she slides. Her foot jamming into it. 
	She lets loose with the flame again. Sebastian, backed 
	into the corner, has no where to go. He's yelling in 
	pain. His latex FACE BUBBLES and burns. The surgical 
	scrubs SINGE BLACK. With no other escape route, he dives 
	toward the door. Linda looks up to see his flaming body 
	fly over her, back into the corridor. Linda kills the 
	tank as Sebastian continues to burn. The elevator lights 
	flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of 
	sparks. The elevator dies. Linda pulls herself to her 
	feet and turns to see...

	Half of Sebastian's head MELTED AWAY, his latex facade a 
	gruesome smoke-damaged mass. His clothes are half burned 
	revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like 
	deformed blackened bubble wrap.

	Sebastian crawls to his feet, but Linda hits him with 
	another shot of flame.

	Sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the 
	corner.

				SEBASTIAN
			Oh God!

	Linda stalks toward him.

				LINDA 
			You wanna see God? I'll show you God. 

	Linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex 
	and clothing strewn about the corridor floor. Sebastian, 
	looking like some ugly creature, pushes down the 
	corridor. He throbs with his blackened skin blistering 
	and cracking up and down his body. Linda lets loose 
	another jet of flame. It's smaller than the first and 
	doesn't quite hit Sebastian. Linda checks the tanks 
	pressure gauge. It slowly drops. Linda follows the 
	blackened horror into the maze of tunnels. But as he 
	pushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re- absorb 
	themselves. Sebastian is no longer visible. A quiet 
	moment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable 
	she is. She looks around for him desperately. Nothing. 
	But something on the ceiling catches her attention. She 
	blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. THE 
	SPRINKLER SYSTEM, hit by fire, comes to life. Water 
	sprays down on the tunnel. Sebastian is caught in the 
	downpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. It comes 
	toward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. He grabs 
	Linda and slams her against the wall. His watery hand 
	smashes her across her face. Linda reels. On the floor, 
	she looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her. She 
	crawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to 
	her feet and slams her against the wall.

				SEBASTIAN
			I'm gonna find everyone in your family 
			and kill them-. Your sister... she 
			never liked me. I think I'll go after 
			her and her little boy first. 

	Sebastian smashes her head against a metal post. Her head 
	cuts open, blood dripping down.

				SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
			I just wanted you to know that before 
			you die.

	Linda collapses to the floor. Sebastian's foot presses 
	against her neck, squeezing it. Linda gags for breath. 
	But through the shoot of water that is Sebastian, we see 
	something also... a watery smudge.

	BAM!

	MATT - smashes Sebastian with the metal bar. Sebastian 
	slams against the corridor wall and sinks down.

	Matt staggers. It's taken all his strength to got there. 
	He drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he 
	sinks to his knees by Linda.

				MATT
			Thought I'd... thought I'd save you 
			for a change.

	He gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Let's got out of here.

	Just as the two turn, Sebastian rises with the crowbar. 
	He swings it with a yell. Matt pushes Linda out of the 
	way, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. The 
	conduit splits open and severs ELECTRICAL wiring. The 
	VOLTAGE shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian. As the 
	current pulses through his body, Sebastian vibrates. His 
	blood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his 
	skeletal structure and major organs. Sebastian is slowly 
	electrified. Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and 
	more visible. Finally he collapses. His body throbbing in 
	and out of visibility. Matt and Linda stumble away.

	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

	Just outside the lab... Linda tries to pry open the 
	sealed doors with the crowbar. But she can't.

	Through the doors porthole she sees a collection of 
	chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion.

				LINDA
			Nitro...

	Matt peaks inside.

				MATT
			He said it himself... All they'll find 
			is a pile of charred corpses.

	She sees the centrifuge... The timed counter on its face 
	counts down from a minute. Fifty nine. Fifty eight. Fifty 
	seven...

				LINDA
			He's rigged the centrifuge.

				MATT
			In an enclosed space, he'll wipe out 
			the whole lab.

	INT. TUNNEL

	Linda and Matt move as fast as they can. They reach the 
	burned out elevator. What the hell are they gonna do? We 
	know the damn thing doesn't work. She swings her crowbar 
	at the ceiling. The maintenance hatch comes down.

				LINDA
			Grab on.

	Linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls 
	herself up. She reaches back down for Matt.

				MATT
			Forget about me. You go.

				LINDA
			Fuck you. Give me your hands.

	Linda grabs Matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth. 
	She struggles, but they both manage to got him through 
	the hatch.

	INT. LABORATORY - DAY

	Three... two... one. The centrifuge springs to life.

	The centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first.

	INT. VENT

	Linda and Matt are on top of the elevator.

	Linda's hands search the wall. Bar fingers run across the 
	smooth metal surface.

	From the little light below she can see a maintenance 
	ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube. 
	They look up and see it disappear into the darkness.

				LINDA
			Climb!

				MATT
			But...

				LINDA
			Climb!

	Matt starts up, rung after rung. Linda climbs right 
	behind him.

	INT. LABORATORY

	The centrifuge spins faster and faster. The vials are 
	starting to rattle.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

	Linda and Matt pull themselves up the ladder as quick as 
	they can.

				MATT
			I can't. I'm going to pass out.

				LINDA
			Keep moving.

	He does, through sheer force of will. Blood from his 
	wound drips down on Linda's face. No telling how much 
	further they have to go in this darkness. Light leaks in 
	from the maintenance hatch below.

	INT. LABORATORY

	The centrifuge's whine has reached a fevered pitch. The 
	vials shake violently.

	Then... one of the vials shatters.

	A FLASH OF LIGHT. A HUGE EXPLOSION rips through the 
	laboratory.

	INT. TUNNEL

	The EXPLOSION rips through the lab doors. A MASSIVE 
	FIREBALL rolls down the tunnel swallowing everything in 
	its path.

	One of the phase shifted animals gets caught in the 
	flames. We see its shape briefly before it disappears In 
	a wall of fire.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

	The ladder begins to shake. The entire shaft begins to 
	rumble. Linda pushes Matt up as they scramble toward 
	safety.

	INT. EXHAUST VENT

	The FIREBALL blows into the vent. Starts rolling down it 
	also.

	INT. TUNNELS

	More explosions.

	CHAIN REACTIONS. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

	THE EXPLOSIONS rolls toward the OPEN ELEVATOR. Slamming 
	into it... The elevator flies upward.

	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT

	The rumbling worsens. The two desperately cling to the 
	ladder. They looks down to see...

	The elevator...

	SURROUNDED BY FLAMES flying up toward them, lifted by the 
	explosion's SHOCK WAVES.

				LINDA
			Oh God!

				MATT
			Don't look.

	The carriage accelerates toward them, faster and faster. 
	Its loose cables whip around the shaft, slapping the 
	walls around the pair. Its gonna hit them! Linda pulls 
	herself close to the ladder and closes her eyes. She's 
	pressed against Matt. The elevator... 50 feet... 40 ... 
	30 ... W0000000SH! It flames RIGHT BY THEM. 
	When Linda opens her eyes, the elevator is HUNDREDS OF 
	FEET ABOVE THEM and a wall of fire is below them, closing 
	in.

				LINDA
			Move!

	Panicked, Linda pushes Matt up the ladder as she stares 
	down at the rising fire wall. But the fire dissipates 
	before it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames 
	reaches up to lick the soles of her feet.

	They hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the 
	elevator peaking far above her. It slows to a stop and 
	BEGINS TO FALL.

				MATT
			It's coming down!

	FASTER AND FASTER. Coming back toward them in complete 
	free- fall. It's emergency brakes clamp down, slowing it. 
	Metal against metal. Sparks flying. One of the brakes 
	shears. Then another. The elevator unseats from it's 
	tracks, SLAMMING against the walls as it TUMBLES. Linda 
	sees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as 
	it ping-pongs toward them... smashing into the access 
	ladder, smashing into the wall. The elevator slows, but 
	continues slamming side-to-side. Linda cringes as the 
	elevator crashes into the wall above them. But it jams 
	there, stopping. They pull their heads away from wall and 
	look up. The elevator just hangs there, suspended. 
	There's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the 
	ladder.

				LINDA
			C'mon. Before it slips.

	They begins to climb up again. Matt shimmies through the 
	tight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed 
	by Linda. She breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs 
	there a moment when ... Ah! Something grabs her. A singed 
	throbbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her 
	leg.

				LINDA (cont'd)
			It's him.

	She kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face - a swirl of 
	dirt, grime and smoke with hollow eyes - rise up the 
	ladder.

				MATT
			Sebastian, you fuck.

				LINDA
			Get off me.

	Sebastian pulls himself up Linda's body. Translucent 
	dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes. Linda 
	tries to climb with this thing on her. But Sebastian 
	grabs her around the neck. She begins choking for breath. 
	Linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder... She looks 
	down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then... She 
	lets go!

				MATT
			No!

	She and Sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam 
	against the top of the elevator. Linda seems to hover a 
	few above the elevator, Sebastian's shadowy outline below 
	her. Matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder. But 
	metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet. 
	Linda struggles to her feet. Sebastian rises. A menacing 
	dark figure stalking toward her. Linda pushes back from 
	him. Sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over 
	to the ladder. The elevator strains and groans.

				LINDA
			Let go of me.

	Sebastian presses her up against the ladder. Presses into 
	her from behind. He has her trapped. His dirty hand 
	reaches out and strokes her hair.

				SEBASTIAN
			Remember the day we met? You were 
			wearing a red dress and you were so 
			pretty. Now... Now look at you.

				MATT
			Get off of her!

	Sebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with 
	his filthy, dirt-smeared mouth and half-burned away face.

				MATT (cont'd)
			Sebastian, stop it.

	Linda and Sebastian struggle. Matt reaches down to try 
	and grab her, help her.

				SEBASTIAN
			You fucked it all up.

	Linda looks at her feet. The last elevator emergency 
	brake grips its cable. She grits her tooth and grabs hold 
	of the ladder.

				LINDA
			Go to hell. 

	Linda stamps on the brake release. The ELEVATOR TUMBLES 
	... along with Sebastian. It slams into the fiery abyss a 
	hundred yards below. Linda hangs, one hand holding onto 
	the ladder, the other holding onto Matt. Matt pulls her 
	back onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength.

	EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Linda and Matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine. 
	Emergency crews close from all directions, sirens 
	roaring. A trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into 
	the sky.

	An ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop 
	out, immediately putting a blanket around her and 
	treating Matt's wounds.

				MARINE GUARD
			What happened?

				LINDA
			We lived.

	Linda looks over her shoulder at the traces of the ruin 
	and she sees a shimmer of heat rising from the ground... 
	almost as if something was there.

               FADE IN:

               INT. OLD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               We see a LITTLE GIRL dancing around in a grainy super 8 home 
               movie. A LITTLE BOY wearing a monster MASK enters the frame. 
               He struggles to lift a double barrel shotgun. He points it 
               at the girl and pretends to SHOOT.

                                     GIRL (V.O.)
                              (whispering slowly)
                         Once I had a cat, he was the sweetest 
                         little guy. Then one day he got sick 
                         and died. My heart was broken. My 
                         whole body hurt.

               She continues dancing. The little boy imitates her.

                                     GIRL (V.O.)
                         After that, I saw things differently, 
                         everything could be summed up with 
                         three simple words... fuck the world.

               The camera swings over to some ugly, toothless relations 
               watching the show. They laugh.

               EXT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

               We open on a dark, lonely stretch of two lane blacktop.

               Off to the side of the road we see a rundown gas station.

                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Hey, welcome back to 93.5 WJRC's

                         Ray and I'll be bringing you the

                         the moldies. The good, the bad and 
                         the uglies straight from the WJRC 
                         vaults.

               A weathered wooden sign proclaims CAPTAIN SPAULDING'S WORLD 
               OF MONSTERS AND MADMEN, sits atop the building.

               A smaller sign below reads FRIED CHICKEN AND GASOLINE.

                         on down to Randall's Penny Save 
                         located on Kimball Rd. just off route

                         Halloween needs.

               SHERIFF HUSTON, a tall southern good old boy, leans against 
               his dusty cruiser smoking a cigarette, pumping gas into his 
               tank.

               INT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

               Inside is a poorman's Ripley's Believe It or Not.

               Bizarre props and treasures of killers and monsters cover 
               the dirty walls. Wax figures of JACK THE RIPPER stand guard 
               before oil paintings by JOHN WAYNE GACY.

                         Alright let's get back to our monster 
                         music marathon with this classic 
                         called The Teddy Bear's Picnic.

               Perched on a stool behind the counter sits CAPTAIN SPAULDING, 
               a crusty looking old man in a filthy clown suit and smeared 
               make-up. The word LOVE is tattooed across his right knuckles 
               and HATE is tattooed across the left.

               He is reading the newspaper, crunching on crackers from a 
               paper bag and halfheartedly listening to a small, nerdy man 
               wearing coke bottle glasses named STUCKY.

               Stucky thumbs through a stack of autographed 8x10 photographs.

                                     STUCKY
                              (speaking through 
                              voicebox in his throat)
                         I... I got back a stack today. Some 
                         nice shots.

                         unfortunately she personalized it...
                              (looking at the photo)

                         that my name gotten all over it. I

                         Yeah, he's all hot on her after he 
                         found some of his dad's old nudie 
                         books hidden in the basement. He 
                         keeps 'em taped inside his school 
                         workbook.

               Spaulding brushes cracker crumbs off his paper and continues 
               reading.

                         his urges, shit the guy's like forty

                         wacking his weasel his other favorite

                         spins it around next to his eyeball.

               EXIT for the restroom.

               Sheriff Huston finishes pumping his gas, gets in his cruiser

               From this POV we RACE across the highway towards the front

                         and bash your fucking balls in.

               Killer Karl steps up and puts his gun against Spaulding's 
               face.

                         inside your skull.

               Spaulding smiles wide, his teeth are yellow and rotted.

               Spaulding's foot kicks a red switch, triggering a silent 
               alarm.

               INT. SPAULDING'S - BACKROOM - NIGHT

               A silent RED LIGHT FLASHES. In the dim glow, we see RAVELLI, 
               a large hunched figure, sitting on the edge of a bed. The 
               figure is heavily bandaged.

               Ravelli reacts to the flashing light, he RISES and puts a 
               huge mask over his head. He EXITS the room.

               INT. BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT

               Stucky sits on the toilet pasting stamps on large yellow 
               envelopes.

               Killer Rich KICKS OPEN the stall, GRABS Stucky by the neck 
               and PULLS him out.

               We move around the outside of the building watching the scene 
               inside unfold. HEAVY BREATHING is heard.

               Rich DRAGS Stucky into the main room.

               INT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

               Karl grows increasingly HOSTILE, knocks a candy display over, 
               raises his gun over his head and fires into the ceiling.

               EXT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

               From Ravelli's POV we watch through the window, as everybody 
               inside starts SHOUTING at each other.

               Suddenly, Rich SHOOTS Stucky. Stucky FALLS BACKWARDS against 
               the wall, screaming in pain.

               We move QUICKLY towards the entrance.

               INT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

               Suddenly... CRASH! Ravelli SMASHES through the front door 
               knocking Karl to the ground. In the light we see that Ravelli 
               is wearing an OVERSIZED CLOWN HEAD. In his hand is a 
               sledgehammer.

               Rich TURNS toward the COMMOTION. The Captain quickly WHIPS 
               OUT a GUN and FIRES. Rich falls dead.

               Ravelli lunges at Karl, smashing him over the head with the 
               hammer. Ravelli's clown head comes loose and falls to the 
               floor. We now see that Ravelli is a bald pitbull of a man 
               with badly scarred skin that is painted white and red.

               Karl hits the floor and begins CONVULSING violently.

               Spaulding STEPS DOWN from behind the counter, puts his foot 
               on Karl's throat and points his pistol at Karl's head.

               We see a BILLBOARD painted on the side of an ABANDONED TRUCK. 
               The sign reads GOD IS DEAD.

               We turn to face the road as a car drives by.

               Fast food wrappers and road maps clutter the car's dashboard, 
               a swinging monkey head dangles from the rear-view mirror.

               Behind the wheel, the driver, BILL HUDLEY, 29, downs the 
               last sip of coffee before crumpling the paper cup and placing 
               it among the other trash before him.

                                     BILL
                         I guess if I had to choose I'd say... 
                         mmmmmm... Sandra Good. She seemed 
                         like a nice girl, I mean in a psycho 
                         kind of way.

               Beside him rides, JERRY GILMORE, 30, slumped down in his 
               seat, reading a magazine with a flashlight, feet hanging out 
               the window.

                         say Lynette Fromme. She's got that 
                         snooty vibe I know you dig.

                                     BILL
                         Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.

                                     JERRY
                         She's pretty cute.

                         Yeah but, she reminds me of this 
                         chick that I remember from fourth 
                         grade... called a... shit, what did 
                         we call her?

                         Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when 
                         ever she got called on by Miss 
                         Chumski, this chick would piss in 
                         her pants and start bawling.

                         There always one kid with no bodily 
                         controls. We had this dude, Jeff 
                         Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker 
                         would just sit there puke all over 
                         himself.

                                     BILL
                         Better than pissing... anyway so, 
                         what's your choice?

                                     JERRY

                         cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but 
                         cute ain't hot.

                         Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was 
                         pretty hot.

                                     JERRY
                         Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult 
                         to get some of that... and the best 
                         part is she didn't try to kill the 
                         President or nothing, so that baggage 
                         ain't hanging around.

                                     BILL
                         I thought she tried to murder a 
                         witness for the prosecution.

                                     JERRY
                         I'll let it slide, she was only 
                         seventeen.

                         no carry-on shit, that's some heavy

                         nuts.

                         and Monsters... cool. Also... fried 
                         chicken and... gasoline... next exit.

                         Perfect.

                         I hope this place is cool. We could 
                         use something interesting to liven 
                         up chapter 12.

               The car drives past. We turn and hold on the billboard. We 
               see the happy smiling face of a young Captain Spaulding.

               EXT. CAPTAIN SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

               The car pulls up to one of the gas pumps. Bill and Jerry get 
               out. Inside we see Spaulding, now in army pants and a hunting 
               jacket, mopping the floor.

                                     BILL
                         I'll pump the gas. Go inside and see 
                         if it's worth thinking about.

                                     JERRY
                              (salutes)
                         OK, Boss.

               Jerry walks inside and immediately comes back out.

                                     JERRY
                         Holy crap. You gotta see this place. 
                         It's awesome.

                                     BILL
                         How awesome?

                                     JERRY
                         Really fucking awesome.

                                     BILL
                         Wake up the chicks and bust out the 
                         camera awesome?

                                     JERRY
                         Hell yeah.

               Jerry sticks his head back inside the car.

                                     JERRY
                         Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

               INT. CAR - BACK SEAT - NIGHT

               A dark haired girl, DENISE WILLIS, 27, sleeps curled up under 
               a blanket.

                                     JERRY
                         Come on, babe. Me and Bill found a 
                         kick ass place.

               She opens her eyes.

                                     DENISE
                         Huh?

                                     JERRY
                         Grab Mary and come inside.

               Denise shakes a lump of jackets and sweaters lying next to 
               her. She removes a sweater from the top of the pile to REVEAL 
               the face of MARY KNOWLES, 29.

                                     DENISE
                         Come on sleeping beauty, time to go 
                         to work.

                                     MARY
                              (half asleep)
                         Sleeping.

                              (groggy)
                         No please, let me sit this one out.

                                     DENISE
                              (removing the blanket)
                         Let's go. You're the one who wanted 
                         to be a photographer.

                                     MARY
                         I resign.

                                     DENISE
                         Too late. You're in for life, let's 
                         move it out Private Shutterbug.

                                     MARY
                              (opening her eyes)
                         Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy 
                         folk art. It's so quaint... it's so 
                         primal... it's so crap.

                                     DENISE
                         Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.
                              (sarcastic)
                         ...and really who are we to judge 
                         the artistic merit of the tin-can 
                         Mona Lisa?

                                     MARY
                         Aw, shit...
                              (exhales deeply)
                         I gotta pee anyway.

               INTERLUDE

               Grainy super 8 footage shows us an OLD MAN standing in front 
               of a small shack. His name is Lewis Dover. The shack is 
               painted white and covered with SIMPLISTIC RELIGIOUS WRITINGS.

                                     LEWIS
                         I ain't no rich man, but I see the 
                         truth. You do not have to go to Hell. 
                         You are in Hell. This is Hell. All 
                         American Hell.
                              (holds up a gun)
                         ...true heaven in my hands... I'm 
                         gonna blow Satan back through the 
                         door to Hell.

               Surrounding the shack are strange sculptures of various half-
               human/half-animal creations.

               INT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

               Spaulding swabs up the last remains of blood from the floor, 
               he drops the mop into a bucket filled with water and blood.

               Bill pays no attention, he is distracted by a strange object 
               in a glass case over the counter. In the case is a shriveled 
               up looking half human and half fish figure. It is the size 
               of a small child. A banner above reads:

               AQUALINA - THE MERMAID.

                                     BILL
                         How long have you been running this 
                         place?

                                     CAPT. SPAULDING
                         How long is a piece of string? Too 
                         God damn long, that's how long.

               Spaulding slides the mop and bucket behind the counter.

                                     BILL
                         No, really.

                                     CAPT. SPAULDING
                         Shit, I don't remember exactly. I 
                         took over for my Pa just after the 
                         Duke nabbed the Oscar.

                                     BILL
                         The Duke?

                                     CAPT. SPAULDING
                         Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head 
                         after that.

                                     BILL
                         You mean John Wayne?

                                     CAPT. SPAULDING
                         Hell, boy there some other Duke you 
                         know about?
                              (rolls up his sleeve 
                              to reveal a John 
                              Wayne tattoo)
                         A great American.

                                     BILL
                         Yeah, I was never that big of a 
                         western fan. I like science fiction.

                         I figured that much. Why the fuck 
                         you asking so many jackass questions 
                         for?

                                     BILL
                         You see me and my friends are writing 
                         a book on offbeat roadside 
                         attractions. You know all the crazy 
                         shit you see when you drive cross 
                         country.

                         I don't drive cross country.

                                     BILL
                         But if you did.

                                     CAPT. SPAULDING
                         I don't.

                                     BILL
                         But suppose for a second you did.

                                     BILL
                         No, no I think it's really 
                         interesting.

                         read about all that horse shit anyway.

               Jerry OVERHEARS Bill's and Spaulding's conversation and joins 
               in to help.

                                     JERRY
                         You'd be surprised. Would it be OK 
                         if we took some pictures and included 
                         this place in our book?

                                     JERRY
                         You got some really rare stuff here...
                              (pointing to Aqualina)
                         ...dig your Feegee mermaid.

               INT. SPAULDING'S - RESTROOM - NIGHT

               The restroom is gray, dingy, a single exposed light bulb 
               hangs from the ceiling. The peeling walls are plastered with 
               newspaper clippings and faded photos.

               Mary is in the stall, sitting on the toilet, staring straight 
               ahead at a poster of RHONDO HATTON, a B-MOVIE ACTOR that 
               suffered from acromegalia.

               Denise standing at a tiny sink, splashes water on her face. 
               She looks at herself in the mirror.

                                     DENISE
                              (water running down 
                              her face)
                         I swear I've aged five years since 
                         this trip started.

                                     MARY
                         Tell me about it.

                                     DENISE
                              (takes a paper towel 
                              and wipes her face)
                         God, I hate falling asleep in the 
                         afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...
                              (stretches)
                         ...ugh, my back is killing me.

                                     MARY
                         Yeah, hey how far do you think we 
                         are from your Dad's?

               Mary flushes the toilet and exits the stall.

                                     DENISE
                         I don't know. Couple hours I think. 
                         I've got to call him.

               Mary washes her hands. Denise ties up her hair.

                                     MARY
                         It will be nice to have a few days 
                         off to regenerate. This trip is fun, 
                         but it's starting to get brutal.

                                     DENISE
                         Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at 
                         that old stripper lady's place. 
                         Watching her dance around with those 
                         ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.

                                     MARY
                         I know, that was some crazy shit. I 
                         never in a million years would have 
                         believed it if I hadn't seen it.

                                     DENISE
                         A decent meal every once in a while 
                         wouldn't hurt either, this road food 
                         is crap.

                                     MARY
                         If I never eat at another Waffle 
                         House again, I can die a happy girl.

                                     DENISE
                         Scattered, smothered and covered.

                                     MARY
                         Exactly... well, I guess a couple 
                         more photos won't kill me.

               INT. SPAULDING'S - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

               Jerry knees over a box of magazines labeled TRUE CRIME $1.00, 
               he flips through an issue, tosses it back.

               Bill leans against the wall next to him, sipping a hot cup 
               of coffee.

               The girls return from the bathroom. Jerry jumps up with 
               excitement.

                                     JERRY
                         Great, you're back. Let's go. We 
                         already paid for the tickets.

                         Tickets for what?

                                     JERRY
                         This isn't everything. Get ready for 
                         this... there's a Museum of Murder 
                         and Mayhem.

                                     DENISE
                         I don't want to see that.

                                     MARY
                         How about if we skip it and just 
                         hang out here. I can get some great 
                         shots of this stuff.

               Jerry PULLS Denise over and puts his arm around her.

                                     JERRY
                         Aw, come on. It will be fun.

                                     DENISE
                         Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds 
                         fun.

               Bill grabs Mary by the hand and kisses it.

                                     BILL
                              (smiling)
                         We'll need pictures of the inside 
                         too.

                                     MARY
                         Alright, alright. I know... I wanted 
                         to be the photographer.

               Bill and Mary kiss.

               Spaulding waits, unamused. He rolls his eyes.

                         black door. The tour is about to 
                         begin.

               Spaulding disappears through a curtain behind the counter. 
               The kids wait.

               The black metal door CREAKS open.

               They enter the darkened room.

               INT. SPAULDING'S - MUSEUM - NIGHT

               Darkness. A blue light comes on. Spaulding is standing on a 
               MOTORIZED PLATFORM. He begins the tour, speaking through a 
               small megaphone.

                         to enter a world of darkness. A world 
                         where life and death are meaningless 
                         and pain is God.

               A lifeless wax figure POPS forward with a loud metal CLANG. 
               Mary jumps back with fright.

                         most of all importantly cannibal. 
                         Born in 1870, Mr. Fish enjoyed burning 
                         himself with hot pokers, spankings 
                         with nail-studded paddles and 
                         embedding needles in his groin. On

                         inserted in to his groin. Mr. Fish 
                         was executed in 1936 at the age of 
                         65.

               Spaulding rolls backwards and continues the tour.

               CLOSE UP ON: a dummy face of a grizzly looking old man in 
               hunting attire.

               Behind the figure of Gein hangs an inverted corpse of a slain

                         bodies of women, especially their 
                         sexual organs. He was quite a handy

                         jewelry and human skin suits from 
                         his victims. Mr. Gein was discovered 
                         when the decapitated body of Bernice 
                         Worden was found gutted like a deer,

                         and most famously a.k.a. Dr. Satan.

                         master surgeon. Mr. Quale an intern 
                         at Willows State Mental Hospital, 
                         nicknamed Weeping Willows for its

                         pleasure in control. Through primitive 
                         brain surgery. Mr. Quale believed he 
                         could create a race of superhumans 
                         from the mentally ill, or so the 
                         story goes. His terrifying experiments 
                         continued until 1952.

               Jerry stares fascinated.

                         At which time he was discovered and 
                         turned over to authorities for 
                         observation. Unfortunately, Mr. Quale 
                         was abducted from his cell by members 
                         of the victims' families. Vigilante 
                         justice prevailed and Dr. Satan was 
                         taken out and hanged. The next day 
                         his body was found to be missing. 
                         Some say he survived, rescued by his 
                         loyal slaves, others say they hung 
                         the wrong man... To this day no sign 
                         of Dr. Satan has ever been discovered. 
                         But who knows? Maybe he lives next

               Denise leans against the glass walls of the phone booth.  
               Various flyers are taped to the inside: free kittens, phone 
               sex ads and a missing poster for a girl named KAREN MURPHY. 
               A light rain begins to fall.

               Denise puts some change in the phone and dials a number.

               EXT. WILLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

               The camera moves down a quaint quiet little street. We come 
               to rest at a modest two-story house. The house is decorated 
               for Halloween.

               Parents and their children roam from house to house, trick 
               or treating.

               We hear the sound of a phone ringing.

               INT. WILLIS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

               A grey haired man sits at a small table eating a ham sandwich 
               and drinking a beer. This is DONALD WILLIS, Denise's father.

               He stands up and walks to the phone hanging on the wall.

                         10.

                                     MARY
                         Maybe he's a cyborg.

                                     BILL
                              (wearily, sips his 
                              coffee)
                         I like sleep.

                                     DENISE
                         Here he comes.

               Jerry comes bouncing out towards the car and jumps in.

               He is holding a map and a box of chicken.

                                     JERRY
                         We hit the jackpot! Let's roll, good 
                         buddy. We got ourselves a convoy.

                                     MARY
                         Huh?

                                     DENISE
                         Ugh, what's that smell?

                                     JERRY
                         Fried chicken.
                              (holds up a drumstick)
                         Anybody want some?

               No one responds.

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               An OLD FARMER and his WIFE stare directly into the camera.

                                     OLD MAN
                         I don't know where that skunk ape 
                         sleeps. Maybe in the trees and all... 
                         all I know is he eats squirrels to 
                         survive and he had impure relations 
                         with my wife.

                                     WIFE
                         That's true. He performed lurid acts 
                         upon me and my person while my husband 
                         Russell was a fix'n to our hound 
                         Clarence.

                                     OLD MAN
                         If I see that thing again... I'm a 
                         gonna kill that skunk ape.

                                     BILL
                              (off screen)
                         What does it look like?

                                     WIFE
                         It looked just like that chubby fella 
                         from McHale's Navy... Ernie Borgnine.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Hold up the picture.

               The wife holds up a pencil sketch of a Bigfoot like creature 
               and a newspaper photo of Ernest Borgnine.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               Bill's car moves past empty farmlands. A HEAVIER RAIN is now 
               falling.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Jerry directs Bill from Spaulding's hand-drawn map.

                                     JERRY
                         Keep straight on this road here.

                                     BILL
                         How much further?

                                     JERRY
                         I'm not exactly sure... it looks 
                         close. Did we pass an abandoned school 
                         bus yet?

                                     BILL
                         I don't know.

               Mary and Denise sit bundled up in blankets.

                                     MARY
                         Let's just skip it. It is probably 
                         nothing anyway.

                                     DENISE
                         Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see 
                         anything now, it's too dark. Let's 
                         forget it.

                                     JERRY
                         Come on, we need something like this. 
                         It could be the real deal. It's too 
                         far out of the way to come back to.

                                     BILL
                         What's that?

               Through the windshield we see a LONE FIGURE hitch-hiking by 
               the side of the road. It is a girl, BABY, 27, in a worn cowboy 
               hat and long fur coat. She is soaked to the bone.

                                     JERRY
                         It's a hitchhiker.

                                     BILL
                         Way out here?

                                     MARY
                         Well, don't even think about playing 
                         the good samaritan, there's way too 
                         many psychos wandering loose these 
                         days.

                                     BILL
                              (looking closer)
                         It's a girl.

                                     JERRY
                         Hey, maybe she knows where this is?

                                     DENISE
                              (sarcastically)
                         That seems likely.

                                     MARY
                         Should we stop?

                                     BILL
                         We can't leave her out here in the 
                         rain... maybe we can just drop her 
                         at the next rest area.

                                     MARY
                         She looks like a freak.

                                     DENISE
                         Stick her in the front, if you want 
                         to pick her up so bad. She's soaked.

                                     MARY
                         She looks like she stinks.

                                     BILL
                              (imitating Mary)
                         She looks like she stinks.

                                     JERRY
                              (makes cat noises)
                         Cat fight, cat fight.

                                     DENISE
                         Hardy har, har.

               The car pulls over and Baby jumps in. The car moves off.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Once inside the car they see that the girl is a bit odd.

                                     BABY
                         Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been 
                         standing out there in that toad 
                         strangling rain for like a hundred 
                         million years.

                                     JERRY
                         Really, that's a long time.

                                     BABY
                         Yeah, most people just whiz on by 
                         like I was invisible or something... 
                         or else they're creeps who wanna jam 
                         their slimy hands down my pants and 
                         twiddle my naughty-naughty.

                                     JERRY
                         Yikes.

                                     BABY
                         Yeah, icky. This one guy stops and I 
                         look in and he's got his thing out 
                         waving it around like a drunk monkey.

                                     DENISE
                         Well, hitchhiking ain't the safest 
                         way for a girl to travel.

                                     BABY
                         Yeah, but it's fun.

                                     MARY
                         Sounds like a magical trip through 
                         the heartland.

                                     BILL
                         Where ya headed?

                                     BABY
                         Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's 
                         house... yeah, I was out doing this 
                         thing.

                                     BILL
                         Where's that?

                                     BABY
                         Couple more miles up this road.

                                     JERRY
                         Hey, you might know...
                              (shows her the map)
                         ...you know where this tree is at? 
                         It's an old hanging tree from...

               The Baby PERKS UP at the mention of the tree.

                                     BABY
                         Yeah, I know where that is, it's 
                         right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's 
                         tree. I can show ya.

                                     JERRY
                         Really, wow, so it's really a real 
                         thing.

                                     BABY
                         Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play 
                         there all the time. But, you can't 
                         find it without me. Outsider can't 
                         find no deadwood.

                                     JERRY
                         Deadwood, is that what it's called? 
                         Cool, will you show us?

                                     BABY
                         Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know 
                         what word I hate?

                                     JERRY
                         What?

                                     BABY
                         Cone.

                                     JERRY
                         Huh... what cone?

                                     BABY
                         Any cone, yeah...
                              (looking out the window)
                         I hate that word... sounds ugly, I 
                         don't like crumple either.

                                     JERRY
                         I always hate saying the word cheese, 
                         every time you get your picture 
                         taken... smile, say cheese.

                                     BABY
                         I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes 
                         make me nervous.

                                     BILL
                         What about the tree?

                                     BABY
                         Oh yeah, the tree.

                                     MARY
                         This is crazy. She don't know nothing.

               Baby turns her attention toward Mary.

                                     BABY
                         Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's 
                         at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute 
                         all bundled up like a cinnamon roll 
                         of Christmas love.

                                     JERRY
                         Cool.

                                     BILL
                         Which way?

                                     BABY
                         Go straight up about another mile... 
                         til we hit Cherrypicker Road and 
                         turn right... it ain't far from there.

               INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL

               The camera FLOATS through the hallways of the Peabody Mental 
               Institution. It is HALLOWEEN.

               PATIENTS wander the stark halls dressed in hospital gowns 
               and cheap plastic masks. Some are laughing, some are 
               screaming.

               We move into a private room. Where we see DOCTOR SATAN 
               completely covered except for his eyes, hovering over a BOUND 
               AND GAGGED PATIENT.

               We move off the doctor to a crayon child's DRAWING of a JACK-
               O'-LANTERN. Tortured screams fill the room.

               EXT. CHERRYPICKER RD. - WOODS - NIGHT

               From a STRANGER'S POV we see the car STRUGGLING down a dirt 
               road.

               INT. CAR - SAME

               Everyone rides in silence, music plays on the radio.

               The song ends and a NEWS REPORTER comes on.

                                     NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
                         This is WJRC News at the top of the 
                         hour... Investigators in Clairemont 
                         County are no closer to identifying 
                         the body of a young woman found 
                         crucified to the doors of St. Mary's 
                         Church yesterday morning.

               Baby lights up a cigarette and takes a drag.

                                     MARY
                         Excuse me, could you not smoke in 
                         here?

               Baby puts out the cigarette on the back of her hand.

                                     NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
                         Local police and State Officials 
                         have released this report...

                                     JERRY
                         What's that?

                                     BILL
                         I don't know. Looks like some kind 
                         of animal.

               Bill stops the car.

               EXT. CHERRYPICKER RD. - WOODS - NIGHT

               Sitting dead center in the middle of the road is a HUMONGOUS 
               DOG. The dog stares straight ahead. Long strands of drool 
               hang from its mouth to the ground.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

                                     MARY
                         Why are we stopping?

                                     BILL
                         There's a dog in the road.

                                     DENISE
                         Honk at him. Scare him.

                                     BILL
                              (honking horn)
                         He won't move.

                                     MARY
                         Go around him.

                                     BILL
                         There's not enough room.

                                     MARY
                         Then run him over, he'll move.

                                     BABY
                         No! He's one of God's creatures, he 
                         can't help it if he's dumb... I'm 
                         just crazy about animals.

                                     MARY
                              (to Denise)
                         The animals have got nothing to do 
                         with it.

               EXT. STRANGER'S POV - SAME

               A gun barrel is raised and we are looking through the sight 
               at the car. Pop! Pop! Pop! The GUN fires THREE SHOTS at the 
               car's rear tire.

               The stranger whistles and the dog moves to the side of the 
               road.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               The SOUND of the heavy rain MASKS the gunshots.

                                     BILL
                         Hey, he moved.

                                     MARY
                         Let's get going before that thing 
                         tries to eat the car or something.

               As the car moves past, Denise stares at the dog sitting calmly 
               to the side of the road. The dog blankly stares back at her.

                                     JERRY
                         That reminds me of a film I saw once 
                         of a guy who got out of his car at 
                         Lion Country Safari to take a picture 
                         of a lion cub and got eaten by the 
                         lions.

                                     BILL
                         Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always 
                         thought it was bullshit.

                                     JERRY
                         No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces 
                         while his family watched from the 
                         car. The wife is screaming, the kids 
                         are crying. Some dude in another car 
                         filmed the whole thing.

                                     BABY
                         I'd like to see that.

                                     MARY
                         Nice.

                                     JERRY
                         The lions were totally covered in 
                         this guy's blood... I think they ate 
                         his face off, tore open his rib cage, 
                         pulled his legs off... it was a wild 
                         scene.

                                     BABY
                         Things like that get a lot bloodier 
                         than ya think.

               Without warning the car lunges to one side.

                                     JERRY
                         What was that?

                                     BILL
                         Fuck. I think we blew a tire.

                                     MARY
                         Don't even say it.

                                     DENISE
                         You got to be fucking joking.

                                     MARY
                         God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt 
                         was fucking bullshit.

                                     BILL
                         OK, let's relax. I'll check it, maybe 
                         I'm wrong. Don't everybody freak out 
                         just yet.

                                     JERRY
                         I'll help ya.

                                     BILL
                              (sarcastic)
                         Gee, ya think it wouldn't be too 
                         much trouble.

               EXT. CHERRYPICKER ROAD - WOODS - NIGHT

               Bill and Jerry stare down at the blown tire sunk in the mud.

                                     BILL
                         I hope you fixed the spare like I 
                         asked ya.

                                     JERRY
                         Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... 
                         um, I can't remember. I think I took 
                         it out to fit the bags and forgot to 
                         put it back.

                                     BILL
                         Jesus Christ, Jerry.

                                     JERRY
                         Well, technically I did what ya said.

                                     BILL
                         You're a real fucking piece of work.

               Bill stares at Jerry in disbelief.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Baby is leaning on her chin staring at Mary and Denise. The 
               car radio plays in the background.

                                     MARY
                         Can I help you with something?

                                     BABY
                         I was just wondering.

                                     MARY
                         Wondering what?

                                     BABY
                         Are you two gals all funny with each 
                         other?

                                     MARY
                         What?

                                     BABY
                         You know... a couple of queers.

                                     MARY
                         Do you believe this fucking girl?

                                     BABY
                              (turning her attention 
                              to Mary)
                         I was just wondering, cause you got 
                         a pissy look about you... like a 
                         real pussy licking bitch.

               Denise tries to QUICKLY defuse the situation.

                                     DENISE
                         No. No pussy licking here, but thanks 
                         for your concern.

               Bill and Jerry slide back into the car.

                                     BILL
                         Well, I got some bad news and some 
                         bad news.

                                     MARY
                         What?

                                     JERRY
                              (fake Scottish accent)
                         Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. 
                         There's no saving it now.

                                     BILL
                         And the spare is safely sitting in 
                         Jerry's garage.

                                     DENISE
                         For fucking sake Jerry, what the 
                         fuck are we gonna do?

               Baby starts laughing.

                                     MARY
                         What the hell are you laughing about?

                                     BABY
                         I just pictured the tire sitting in 
                         a chair watching TV.

                                     MARY
                         Oh, wonderful.
                              (muttering to herself)
                         Fucking psycho.

                                     BILL
                         I guess I'll try to back it out on 
                         the rim... at least to the main road.

                                     BABY
                         If you keep going straight you can 
                         get back on the interstate... it's 
                         easier.

                                     MARY
                         Just back up.

                                     JERRY
                         I think we should go straight. I 
                         mean we know for a fact there ain't 
                         nothing back that way, right?

                                     BABY
                         Oh wait! I love this song!

               Baby reaches over and TURNS UP the VOLUME. She loudly sings 
               along with the song.

                                     BILL
                         Fine. I'll go straight.

                                     MARY
                         What!

                                     BILL
                              (over the loud music)
                         Fine! I'll go straight!

               The car moves forward. After about fifty yards the car HITS 
               something hard and gets stuck in a deep mud bog.

                                     BILL
                         Fuck! We are fucked!

                                     DENISE
                         Turn that fucking radio off!

               Bill shuts off the radio.

                                     DENISE
                         Now what are we gonna do?

                                     BABY
                         We can walk to my house from here. 
                         My brother's got a tow truck, he can 
                         come get your car.

               A silence falls over the car.

                                     MARY
                         I think I'm going fucking crazy.

                                     DENISE
                         I can't believe...

                                     BILL
                         OK, whatever. Let's go get your 
                         brother's truck. Faster we get the 
                         truck, faster we get out of here.

                                     BABY
                         OK.

                                     JERRY
                         I'll go. It's my fault.

                                     MARY
                         You said it, not me.

                                     BILL
                         Forget it. I'll just go.

                                     MARY
                         Screw that, no way, I ain't letting 
                         you go by yourself.

                                     BILL
                         Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just 
                         stay here, no sense everybody getting 
                         drenched.

                                     JERRY
                         I agree.

                                     BABY
                         Yeah, it won't take long and besides 
                         you sassy poodle girls will slow us 
                         down.

               Baby jumps up and gets out of the car.

                                     BILL
                         Don't worry, I'll be right back.

                                     BABY
                         Come on.

                                     JERRY
                         Don't forget the flashlight, it's 
                         pretty dark out there.

                                     BILL
                         Thanks.

                                     JERRY
                         No problem.

               Bill kisses Mary good-bye and EXITS.

               Mary watches Baby and Bill head off into the WOODS. Baby 
               turns and makes a kissy face at Mary.

               EXT. MISS BUNNY'S HOLLYWOOD REVUE - DAY

               A hand painted tin sign surrounded by flashing lights which 
               reads MISS BUNNY'S HOLLYWOOD REVUE hangs over the entrance 
               to a small garage.

               Movie star portraits of JEAN HARLOW, W.C. FIELDS and CLARK 
               GABLE adorn the walls of the garage.

               An over the hill ex-glamour girl, MISS BUNNY, 55, comes into 
               frame. She's dressed in a sparkling red gown with feathers 
               in her hair.

                                     MISS BUNNY
                              (bad Marilyn Monroe 
                              imitation)
                         Hi, I'm Miss Bunny and welcome to my 
                         Hollywood Revue...
                              (she giggles)
                         ...where the stars shine forever.

               INT. MISS BUNNY'S HOLLYWOOD REVUE - DAY

               Tinseltown lives. Tin foil is wrapped around everything, the 
               walls, doors and ceiling. Fake cement handprints of movie 
               greats cover the tiny floor. Badly sculpted statues of MARILYN 
               MONROE, GROUCHO MARX and JOHN WAYNE stand in the corners.

               Dead center is a small puppet show stage.

                                     MISS BUNNY
                         Hi, this is the place where the magic 
                         happens.

               CLOSE UP - SQUIRREL

               A stuffed squirrel dressed in a gray skirt and jacket, a 
               tilted hat sits atop its head.

                                     MISS BUNNY
                              (holding up squirrel)
                         This is Jenny, she is our resident 
                         Ingrid Bergman.

               Miss Bunny picks up a stuffed white cat wearing a brown 
               trenchcoat.

                                     MISS BUNNY
                         This is Ronald J. Perrywinckle... 
                         our Humphrey Bogart... today we'll 
                         be doing a scene from Casablanca.

               Miss Bunny begins to make the dead animal puppets interact. 
               She provides their voices.

                         you're not with him you'll regret 
                         it... maybe not today, maybe not 
                         tomorrow but soon and for the rest 
                         of your life.

                         We'll always have Paris. We didn't 
                         have, we lost it... until you came 
                         to Casablanca. We got it back last 
                         night.

                         And you never will.

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               A single flashlight beam cuts through the darkness of the 
               dense woods. Bill stumbles behind Baby, she is clearly in 
               her element.

                                     BILL
                         How much further?

                                     BABY
                         Almost there... are you in a hurry 
                         or something?

                                     BILL
                         Well, yeah, kind of.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Jerry is stretched out across the front seat, reading a book 
               on Freak Shows. Denise and Mary sit in the back, curled up 
               under layers of blankets and clothes.

                                     DENISE
                         Fuck, it's freezing.

                                     JERRY
                         Hey, listen to this... I think this 
                         is related to our Dr. Satan.

                                     DENISE
                         Oh, yeah.

                                     JERRY
                         Yeah, in this book there's a chapter 
                         called Self Made Freaks about how 
                         people would mutilate themselves in 
                         order to work in a freak show. It 
                         mostly talks about tattooed people 
                         and wild men of Borneo and shit like 
                         that, but there is one mention of a 
                         single case where a woman was 
                         suspected of having her arms removed 
                         on purpose to become an arm-less 
                         wonder.

                                     DENISE
                         Yeah, so how does that fit with the 
                         story of four morons with a flat 
                         tire looking for a dead tree?

                                     JERRY
                         It says, "records show that Ellie 
                         Thompson was born in 1914 of normal 
                         physical stature and lived a life of 
                         normal bearings, until such time 
                         that she was placed in the care of 
                         the Willows State Mental Facility."

                                     DENISE
                         So.

                                     JERRY
                         Now she was put in the nuthouse in 
                         1930 at the age of 16.

                                     DENISE
                         Why?

                                     JERRY
                              (scanning the book)
                         Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, 
                         but she was released sometime in 
                         1937, only to reappear as Ellie 
                         Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says 
                         she, "criss-crossed the United States 
                         constantly in carnivals and freak 
                         shows until her death in 1946."

                                     DENISE
                         Yeah?

                                     JERRY
                         These dates perfectly correspond 
                         with the time frame of our beloved 
                         Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. 
                         I'll bet he amputated her arms.

                                     DENISE
                         So what?

                                     JERRY
                         I don't know, I just thought it was 
                         interesting.

                                     DENISE
                         You know what Jerry, who really cares 
                         at this point?

                                     JERRY
                         I don't...
                              (to himself)
                         ...I just thought it was weird.

                                     MARY
                              (bursting in)
                         God damn it, I must be fucking crazy 
                         to let him go off with that crazy 
                         fucking bitch.

                                     JERRY
                         Huh?

                                     MARY
                         That stupid hillbilly slut.

                                     JERRY
                         Oh, don't blow everything out of 
                         proportion.

                                     MARY
                         You didn't see the look she threw 
                         me. She's up to something.

                                     DENISE
                         Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty 
                         fucked shit to us.

                                     JERRY
                         When?

                                     DENISE
                         When you were outside with Bill.

                                     MARY
                         She said we look like pussy lickers 
                         or some shit like that.

                                     DENISE
                         Yeah, she said we looked queer.

                                     JERRY
                         Aw, get over it, she's just some 
                         dopey redneck, she ain't smart enough 
                         to be up to nothing... I mean 
                         anything... chicks.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

               An old Gothic FARMHOUSE stands atop a hill at the end of a 
               long sloping dirt road. SCARECROWS with pumpkin heads hang 
               CRUCIFIED on crosses lining the drive. Everything is severely 
               overgrown.

               Bill and Baby enter the gates of the FARM, they walk up the 
               main drive.

               Baby runs forward and begins jumping around in the huge mud 
               puddles, then runs up onto the front porch of the old house.

               The front of the house is covered with strange junk art. 
               Hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls.

                                     BABY
                         These are all my dolls. I use to 
                         like to chop their heads off.

               Broken bottles and cans are cemented together in weird HUMAN 
               FIGURES, ANIMAL SKINS stretched over bone armatures form a 
               makeshift roof.

               Glowing down from the upper windows are grinning JACK-O'-
               LANTERNS.

                                     BABY
                         The door's locked. I'll gotta go 
                         around... wait here.

                                     BILL
                         OK.

               Baby RUNS OFF around the side of the house.

               Bill stands looking off into the distance at the desolate 
               farm grounds. The rain continues to hammer down.

               From BILL'S POV we see a silhouette of a LONE FIGURE walking 
               in the distance. The shape of a large dog follows behind 
               him.

               Bill JUMPS, startled by the sound of the heavy front door 
               opening.

                                     BILL
                         Christ, you scared the shit out of 
                         me.

                                     BABY
                         Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.

                                     BILL
                         Is your brother ready to go?

                                     BABY
                         Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll 
                         wait inside, come on.

                                     BILL
                         He left!

                                     BABY
                         Yeah, come on.

               Baby GRABS Bill by the arm and pulls him into the house.  
               The heavy iron door slams shut.

               INT. CAR - SAME

               Denise and Mary sit facing one another, playing cards.

               Mary deals from a deck.

               Jerry naps in the front seat.

                                     MARY
                         How long has it been?

                                     DENISE
                         I don't know... about half an hour.

               A metal KLANG is faintly heard.

                                     MARY
                         What was that?

                                     DENISE
                         What? I didn't hear anything.

                                     MARY
                         Wait... quiet. Turn off the radio.

               Mary reaches over the front seat and turns off the radio.

                                     DENISE
                         Now... listen.

               They sit in silence.

                                     MARY
                         I don't hear anything.

                                     DENISE
                              (whispering)
                         Shhhhhh, quiet.

                                     MARY
                         I still don't.

                                     DENISE
                         Turn on the headlights. See if 
                         anything is out there.

               Mary turns on the headlights. Denise lets out a blood-curdling 
               SCREAM. Jerry bolts up.

                                     JERRY
                         What... what!

               Standing dead center in the road is the GIANT SHAPE of a MAN 
               holding a heavy chain with a huge hook on the end.

                                     MARY
                         Lock the doors... quick, quick.

               Everybody scrambles to lock the doors.

                                     DENISE
                         Holy fuck, holy fuck, holy fuck.

               On closer inspection, Jerry notices the chain is attached to 
               the back of a TOW TRUCK.

                                     JERRY
                         Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm 
                         down! It's the tow truck guy.

                                     MARY
                         What!

                                     DENISE
                         Jesus Christ.

                                     MARY
                         I think I'm gonna have a fucking 
                         heart attack.

                                     JERRY
                              (Scottish accent)
                         OK lassies, I think it's time you 
                         get to gripping reality.

                                     MARY
                         Enough with the stupid voices.

               The brute man attaches the chain to the car and begins raising 
               it with his truck.

               A SIGN on the side of the truck reads FIREFLY TOWING.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE UP - TV SCREEN

               We are watching a scene from THE OLD DARK HOUSE. GLORIA 
               STUART, RAYMOND MASSEY and MELVYN DOUGLAS are standing in 
               the rain pounding on a huge wooden door.

                                     GLORIA STUART
                         Knock again louder.

                                     MELVYN DOUGLAS
                         I should of thought that was loud 
                         enough to wake the dead... that's an 
                         idea.

                                     RAYMOND MASSEY
                         What is?

                                     MELVYN DOUGLAS
                         Wouldn't it be dramatic, supposing 
                         the people inside were dead. All 
                         stretched out with the lights quietly 
                         burning about them.

                                     GLORIA STUART
                         I'm sure it would be very amusing.

               We pull back from the TV to see Bill's clothes drying by the 
               fireplace. Bill, now wearing overalls and a flannel shirt, 
               is sitting on an old over stuffed sofa.

                                     BILL
                         So, you live here alone... I mean 
                         with just your brother?

                                     BABY
                              (speaking from the 
                              next room)
                         No. There's a bunch a us 'round 
                         somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. 
                         She sleeps a lot, now... do you want 
                         marshmallows?

                                     BILL
                         Um, yeah sure, I guess.

                                     BABY
                         You sure do a lot of guessing.

               Baby sets down the tray, making sure to bend over close to 
               Bill. She hands him his drink and sits down next to him.

                                     BILL
                         Thank you.

                                     BABY
                         You're welcome.

               Baby moves closer to Bill, he begins to get nervous.

                                     BILL
                         Hey, um...
                              (pointing to the 
                              mounted animal head 
                              over the fireplace)
                         ...what kind of animal is that?

                                     BABY
                         A dead one.

                                     BILL
                              (sipping his drink)
                         Mmmmm, this is tasty.

                                     BABY
                              (scoops out some 
                              marshmallow with her 
                              finger)
                         Ain't the only thing tasty in this 
                         house.
                              (licks it off)

                                     BILL
                         I wonder what time it is. Seems kind 
                         of late.

                                     BABY
                         Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my 
                         bedtime... are you flirting with me?

                                     BILL
                         What? No, I'm was worried that... I 
                         was just wondering what's taking so 
                         long.

                                     BABY
                         Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and 
                         killed everbody?

                                     BILL
                         That's not something to joke about.

                                     BABY
                              (rolls her eyes)
                         OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin 
                         ate 'em up.

               Finally, the SOUND OF A TRUCK pulling up can be HEARD.

               Bill jumps up and goes to the window.

                                     BILL
                         Hey, great they're back.

                                     BABY
                              (sarcastically)
                         Whoopie fucking doo.

               On the B+W screen we see DR. WOLFENSTEIN, a local horror 
               movie host. He looks like a cross between the WOLFMAN and 
               LON CHANEY in LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT.

                                     DR. WOLFENSTEIN
                              (sounds like Wolfman 
                              Jack)
                         Aaaahooooh, the Doctor is in! Don't 
                         move, don't scream. Stay tuned for

                         and will be with you until the end. 
                         Aaaaaaahooooooh!

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

               Bill stands on the front porch watching as the truck roughly 
               jerks the car to a stop.

               Jerry jumps out, opens the back door and helps Denise.

                                     JERRY
                              (looking at Bill)
                         Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.

                                     DENISE
                         Thanks for coming to get us. Little 
                         brother almost scared us to death.

                                     JERRY
                              (quietly to Bill as 
                              he passes)
                         Dude, your chick's a little high 
                         strung.

               Mary is the last one out of the car. She says nothing as she 
               walks to join the others on the porch.

               Her look says it all as she walks by Bill and into the house.

                                     BILL
                         Mary, I'm sorry but he left without 
                         me. Mary... come on, you don't think 
                         I'd leave you stranded out there.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

               Everyone stands around at the fireplace, trying to dry off.

                                     DENISE
                         Look. I gotta call my Dad and tell 
                         him we're gonna be late. Can I use 
                         your phone?

               Baby sits silently watching TV.

                                     DENISE
                         Excuse me, may I please use your 
                         phone?

                                     MARY
                              (sarcastically)
                         Bill, why don't you ask her... she's 
                         your special friend.

               A VOICE from upstairs answers.

                                     MOTHER
                         Ain't got one.

               MOTHER comes into view from the darkness above. She is in 
               her fifties, but looks younger. A sleazy white trash queen. 
               She slowly descends the stairs.

                                     DENISE
                         Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a 
                         phone?

                                     MOTHER
                         No, none. I had one once, back in 
                         '57 maybe... I don't know. Really 
                         ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping 
                         at around here no more.

                                     JERRY
                         Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck 
                         could drive us to a phone.

                                     MOTHER
                         His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we 
                         all call him R.J.

                                     JERRY
                         Oh, right.

                                     MOTHER
                         What do they call you, sweety?

                                     JERRY
                         Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise 
                         and Mary.

                                     BILL
                         Yeah, maybe R.J. could just tow us 
                         and our car to the nearest garage.

                                     DENISE
                         I mean obviously we will compensate

                                     MOTHER
                         Oh, you ain't no troubles, no, no, 
                         no fuss.
                              (claps her hands)

                         doing with these nice folks' 
                         automobile.

               Baby slowly rises like a defiant child and walks out of the 
               room.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Mother, Jerry, Denise and Mary are all seated on the sofa. 
               Bill sits in an easy chair.

                                     MOTHER
                         So, what brings you kids way out 
                         here, ain't you got something better 
                         to do for Halloween than wander around 
                         out here in the sticks?

                                     JERRY
                         Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a 
                         hoedown.

                                     MOTHER
                              (flirting)
                         Oh, really...
                              (puts her hand on 
                              Jerry's knee and 
                              winks)
                         ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if 
                         you know what I mean... I bet I got 
                         a few moves you ain't never seen.

                                     JERRY
                         I don't doubt that.

                                     DENISE
                         No, he's just joking. We don't really 
                         have any plans other than spending 
                         the night at my Dad's house...
                              (glances at Jerry)
                         ...which is where we were headed 
                         when our car broke down.

                                     MOTHER
                         That's nice.

                                     DENISE
                         Yeah, I guess I'll just help him 
                         hand out candy to the trick or 
                         treaters.

                                     JERRY
                         And I'm gonna help put the razor 
                         blades in the candy apples.

                                     MOTHER
                         I'll bet you are... you are a naughty 
                         little thing aren't ya.

                                     JERRY
                         I was just kidding.

               Bill and Mary snicker at Jerry's comments. Denise tries to 
               keep a straight face.

                                     MOTHER
                         Oh, I get it... I guess you think 
                         you're too good for the simple 
                         pleasures of Halloween.

                                     MARY
                         No, just a little too old.

                                     MOTHER
                         Oh really, well I hope something 
                         changes your mind some day.

               Baby returns from the garage.

                                     BABY
                         Tiny's home.

                                     MOTHER
                         What about R.J.?

                                     BABY
                         Oh, he was already gone before I 
                         seen him... but Tiny saw him and 
                         said he said he was going out to the 
                         yard to get a new wheel.

                                     BILL
                         The yard, what's that?

                                     MOTHER
                         It's an old auto junkyard out in 
                         Baldwin.

                                     DENISE
                         How long is that gonna take?

                                     MOTHER
                         He should be back in a couple hours.

                                     MARY
                         A couple hours!

                                     DENISE
                         Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?

               Mother and Baby laugh.

                                     MOTHER
                              (laughing)
                         Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even 
                         got a bicycle.

                                     DENISE
                         How's he get around out here?

                                     BABY
                         He walks, duh.

                                     MARY
                         Fucking great.

                                     MOTHER
                         I know you're my guests and welcome 
                         but I'd please advise you to keep 
                         from cussing while in my house, thank 
                         you.

                                     MARY
                         Sorry.

                                     MOTHER
                         Well, even though I know it seems 
                         childish to you all. Tonight is 
                         Halloween eve and it special to us 
                         so you are all invited to stay for 
                         dinner.

               Under the circumstances they realize they have no choice. 
               They grin and bear it.

                                     DENISE
                         Thank you.

                                     JERRY
                              (imitates Elvis)
                         Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.

                                     MOTHER

                              shoulder suggestively)
                         You're a strange one, aren't ya honey. 
                         I think you and me are get on like...
                              (she thinks for a 
                              second)
                         ...like something real good.

               Camera moves over to the TV. THE END fades up on screen.  
               Dr. Wolfenstein appears over the credits.

                                     DR. WOLFENSTEIN
                         There well, who knew there was love 
                         to be found in The Old Dark House. 
                         Coming up next, do not move a muscle, 
                         an artery or a vein as we venture 
                         into another creepy classic... are 
                         you ready for THE WOLFMAN, baby?

               INT. HOUSE - DINING ROOM

               Bill, Jerry, Mary and Denise are now all seated around a 
               large dining room table. A thick mountain of candles sits 
               burning dead center on the table, giving off a warm glow. 
               Dozens of Halloween decorations dangle from strings over the 
               table, spiders, bats and black cats.

               There is a hand-made PAPER MACHE MASK sitting on each plate.

                                     MARY
                              (holding up the witch 
                              mask)
                         I hope to Christ she doesn't expect 
                         us to wear these things.

                                     BILL
                         Whatever it is just do it. The more 
                         we play along the faster we'll get 
                         the hell out of here.

                                     DENISE
                         Really, now is not the time to make 
                         waves.

                                     JERRY
                         Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt 
                         to show up.

                                     DENISE
                         Shhhhhh.

               Mother walks in holding a covered serving tray.

                                     DENISE
                         You sure you don't need any help in 
                         there?

                                     MOTHER
                         No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of 
                         host would I be if I put my guests 
                         to this kind of work.

               She sets the tray and goes back in the kitchen.

               BOOM! The sound of the front door SLAMMING shut is heard, 
               followed by the POUNDING of heavy footsteps.

               Mother's and Baby's shouting is heard.

                                     BABY (O.S.)
                         Ma, Tiny's in.

                                     MOTHER (O.S.)
                         Go tell him to get your Grandpa.

               INT. HOUSE - BABY'S ROOM

               Baby is standing in front of her closet staring at her 
               clothes. The walls of her room are covered with B+W photos 
               of movie stars.

                                     BABY
                              (whining)
                         Ma, I can't, I'm busy getting dressed.

               INT. HOUSE - DINING ROOM

               TINY ENTERS and removes his coat.

               Everyone is speechless.

               Tiny is over SEVEN FEET TALL and weighs THREE HUNDRED POUNDS. 
               He is wearing a black sweater with a big red skull stitched 
               into it. A red knit ski mask covers his face. Black gloves 
               cover his hands.

               Tiny sits at the table, looks down at his plate and says 
               nothing.

               Mother comes to fetch Tiny. She relays a message to him with 
               strange hand gestures.

               Tiny gets up and leaves the room.

                                     MOTHER
                         You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't 
                         hear so much.

                                     DENISE
                         Oh.

                                     MOTHER
                         Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's 
                         fault. I mean Earl was a good man... 
                         I mean he never hit me or nothing, 
                         but one day he just got up and went 
                         pure devil on us all.

                                     DENISE
                         What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's 
                         none of my business.

                                     MOTHER
                         He tried to burn the house down, 
                         said it was possessed by the spirits. 
                         Tiny was sleeping in the basement 
                         where the fire started. I don't think 
                         Earl ever meant to harm us... but 
                         Tiny was badly burnt, his ears were 
                         destroyed and most of his skin.

                                     BILL
                         Is that why he wears the mask?

                                     MOTHER
                         Yeah, my baby boy gets shy around 
                         new people, but he'll warm up to 
                         ya... especially the ladies.

                                     JERRY
                         Great. I thought I felt a certain 
                         attraction between Mary and Tiny 
                         soon as he walked in.

                                     MOTHER
                         Maybe. He's a real lady killer.

                                     JERRY
                         Didn't ya think, Mary?

               Mary just smiles, then gives Jerry a dirty look.

                                     MOTHER
                         Well, we'll see... the night is young 
                         and so are you... oh well, couple 
                         more minutes.

               Mother returns to the kitchen.

                                     DENISE
                              (elbows Jerry)
                         Don't be such a fucking smart ass.

                                     MARY
                         Yeah, it's really your fault that 
                         we're stuck in this shithole in the 
                         first place.

                                     JERRY
                         Oh, don't worry she didn't get 
                         offended by what I said. You two got 
                         to lighten up... right, Bill?

                                     BILL
                         Whatever, at this point all I care 
                         about is food. I'm starving and I 
                         got a fucking killer headache.

                                     JERRY
                         Hey, I asked you if you wanted some 
                         chicken.

                                     BILL
                         Didn't look like chicken to me, more 
                         like fried pussy cat.

                                     JERRY
                              (shrugs)
                         Tasted pretty good.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - GRAMPA'S ROOM - NIGHT

               In a cramped, darkened room we see the huge shape of Tiny 
               hovering over a BED containing the hunched, fragile old body 
               of GRAMPA.

               Grampa struggles to sit, then slowly slides his legs over 
               the edge of the bed. Tiny helps him to stand.

                                     GRAMPA
                         God damn it, I can do it. I can do 
                         it myself, ya big monkey. I ain't 
                         dead yet... so don't you and your 
                         sister start counting out my money 
                         yet.

               Grampa steadies himself against Tiny. They slowly walk out 
               of the room.

                                     GRAMPA
                         God damn, my dogs are barking.

               As they move into the light of the hallway, it is clear that 
               Grampa is in his late 80's.

               Grampa quickly grows tired. Tiny picks him up in his arms 
               and carries him down the stairs to the dining room.

               As they move past, the camera comes to rest on a STRANGE 
               OBJECT sitting on a shelf.

               A LARGE GLASS JAR containing a DEFORMED BABY. The pickled 
               punk looks to have a small second head growing from its 
               temple. The label on the jar reads STUFFY 1973.

               The sound from the TV fades up in the background.

               BELA LUGOSI'S VOICE can be heard.

                                     BELA LUGOSI (V.O.)
                         Your hands, please. Your left hand 
                         shows your past...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               TV SCREEN

               Bela is seen as a fortune teller holding a woman's hands. 
               This is a scene from The Wolfman.

                                     BELA LUGOSI
                         ...and your right hand shows your 
                         future.

               CLOSE UP

               We see a tight shot of the woman's palm. A pentagram appears.

               INT. DENISE'S FATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               We PULL BACK from the TV to find Donald Willis sitting in a 
               old easy chair. The room is modest, but comfortable.

               He reaches over and picks up a small alarm clock, notices 
               the time, concerned look comes over his face.

               The phone rings. He quickly answers it.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Hello, Denise?

               Disappointment. He mutes the TV.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Oh, yeah... no, Fred. I was hoping 
                         you were Denise, she's a little late.
                              (pausing)
                         Yeah, yeah I'm sure the rain just 
                         slowed 'em down... yeah... uh-huh, 
                         yeah... no, no you can keep it 'til 
                         Tuesday... alright, talk to ya 
                         tomorrow, bye.

               Unmutes the sound on the TV.

               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               The feast is on. Mother, Tiny, Grampa, Jerry, Bill, Mary and 
               Denise are gathered around the table.

                                     MOTHER
                         OK, everyone, put on your masks. We 
                         can't very well eat with our everyday 
                         faces exposed.

               Mother puts on her mask, Tiny and Grampa follow. Jerry, Bill 
               and Denise slowly raise up their masks, Mary hesitates.

                                     GRAMPA
                              (to Mary)
                         Christ kid, put it on. She ain't 
                         letting any of us touch the grub 
                         'til you're wearing the damn thing.

               Mary rolls her eyes and complies.

                                     JERRY
                         I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... 
                         Ummmm.

                                     MOTHER
                              (hesitates)
                         Firefly.

                                     JERRY
                         Firefly... mmmmm odd name. Mrs. 
                         Firefly, do you know anything about 
                         the legend of Dr. Satan?

                                     BILL
                         Here we go.

               Grampa shifts his eyes onto Mother.

                                     MOTHER
                              (nervously)
                         Well, I'm not much for local gossip 
                         an this and that, but I've heard it 
                         mentioned in passing over the years 
                         but... I mean folks is queer and 
                         they say things, crazy things you 
                         know what I mean?

                                     GRAMPA
                         It's all talk, yakty yak, like a 
                         bunch of hungry chipmunks... Christ, 
                         Dr. Satan. That takes the bull's 
                         nuts alright...
                              (starts laughing)
                         ...hey, I hear some genius up north 
                         got a hot line on the Easter Bunny 
                         for ya.

               A voice from the shadows interrupts.

                                     OTIS
                              (slowly)
                         I know all about what you want to 
                         know about.

               A PALE FIGURE creeps forward like NOSFERATU from a dark corner 
               of the room. This is OTIS.

               He stands six foot, but is deathly slim. His skin is 
               translucent, glowing in the dark. Long thin white hair covers 
               his head. His eyes are grey. He is an ALBINO.

               He is holding a GLASS JAR containing a SMALL FETUS. On closer 
               inspection we see there are two small bodies joined to one 
               head. The label reads WOLF.

                                     MOTHER
                              (happy surprise)
                         Otis! I can't believe you decided to 
                         come down and join us... and you 
                         brought little Wolf. This really is 
                         a special night... all my babies 
                         together.

               Otis sets the disturbing jar of Wolf on the table. He leans 
               forward onto the jar, resting his chin.

                                     OTIS
                         Now, I don't know where you heard 
                         all your little fairy fables about 
                         Dr. Satan but...

                                     BILL
                         From a Captain Spaulding down at 
                         some museum.

                                     OTIS
                              (laughing)
                         That old bitch hog don't know shit. 
                         He tells cute little tattle-tales to 
                         sell his junk, but he don't sell no 
                         Yankee boys no truth.

                                     JERRY
                         But something happened, right? I 
                         mean the story is based on a real 
                         incident, right?

                                     GRAMPA
                              (mouth full of food)
                         What are you, Jimmy Olsen cub reporter 
                         for the Daily Asshole?

                                     MOTHER
                         Grampa... watch the language.

                                     OTIS
                         I ain't sure that you really need to 
                         know. It's better you go home still 
                         dreaming about your kitty cats and 
                         puppy dogs.

                                     JERRY
                         I really want to know.

                                     GRAMPA
                         Hey, the kid wants to know. Enlighten 
                         him.

                                     OTIS
                         Boy, I bet you'd stick your head in 
                         the fire if I told ya you'd see 
                         Hell... meanwhile you too stupid to 
                         realize you got a demon sticking out 
                         your ass singing, "Holy Miss Moly, I 
                         got a live one."

                                     DENISE
                         Can we please change the subject?

               The CLOCK on the wall strikes TEN.

                                     GRAMPA
                              (shouting)
                         Dinner's over.
                              (pushes his plate 
                              back and stands up)
                         Ladies and Germs... it's showtime.

               Grampa hobbles out of the room.

                                     BILL
                         What's he so excited about?

                                     DENISE
                         Yeah, showtime for what?

                                     MOTHER
                         For the show. It's Halloween eve and 
                         time for our show.

                                     JERRY
                         Oh, you mean on TV.

                                     MOTHER
                         No, no, no it's so much more special 
                         than that... you'll see, you'll be 
                         the first to ever see. I think this 
                         is something you'll really love.

                                     JERRY
                         Great.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - BARN - NIGHT

               Billy, Jerry, Mary and Denise stand waiting in front of an 
               old barn. Tiny unlocks the huge doors of the barn and swings 
               them open.

               Standing inside waiting is Mother. She is all dressed up for 
               the occasion.

                                     MOTHER
                         Please, come in... how many in your 
                         party...
                              (she counts the heads)
                         ...one, two, three and four... right 
                         this way.

               Mother hands each of them a folded piece of paper, which 
               serves as a program book. Hand drawn on each is an orange 
               pumpkin.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - BARN - NIGHT

               We follow Mother inside.

               Thousands of red Christmas lights hang down, strung through 
               the rotting wood rafters. Crates, barrels and an odd 
               assortment of chairs face a large quilted curtain. Filling 
               these seats are LIFELESS DUMMIES.

                                     MOTHER
                         Please be seated.

               Mother motions toward four empty seats in the front row.

                                     JERRY
                              (whispering)
                         This is way too fucked up for words.

                                     MARY
                              (loud whisper)
                         I know the words... fucking psycho 
                         fucking bullshit, that's the words.

                                     BILL
                         Just grin and bear it.

                                     DENISE
                         That food...
                              (holding stomach)
                         ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.

               Jerry, Bill, Mary and Denise take their seats.

               Mary flips open the program. Inside, written in crayon, are 
               the words: HALLOWEEN EXTRAVAGANZA -- starring the Comedy 
               Legend GRAMPA and the World Famous BABY.

                                     MARY
                              (to Bill)
                         Check this out.

                                     BILL
                         Well, ya can't complain I never take 
                         you anyplace.

               The sound of a warped crackling record fills the room. Lounge 
               music.

               A small spotlight hits the quilted curtain covering the stage. 
               Mother Firefly stands behind the controls.

               She is smiling proudly.

               The curtain clumsily parts TO REVEAL:

               A stage set pieced together from amusement park wreckage.

               A giant painted plywood devil looms over the stage, surrounded 
               by dancing skeletons and demon girls.

               A microphone stands center stage.

                                     BILL
                              (quietly)
                         I can't believe what I'm seeing.

                                     JERRY
                         I know, this is fucking nuts.

                                     MARY
                         This is starting to make me real 
                         uncomfortable.

                                     BILL
                         Just sit back and enjoy the show.

               The sound of CANNED APPLAUSE fills the room. Bill begins to 
               applaud, Jerry and Denise join in. Mary does not.

                                     GRAMPA (V.O.)
                         Ladies and gentlemen, straight from 
                         his smash six week sold out run at 
                         Tiki-Ti Club... the Stardust lounge 
                         is proud to present Mr. Sexy 
                         himself... Grampa Hugo.

               Grampa walks out to center stage, mic in hand and begins to 
               speak.

                                     GRAMPA
                         Hey, let me tell ya a story... so 
                         I'm hanging out with my buddy Hal 
                         Jackowictz and I'm like, hey Hal 
                         let's go get some booze and chase 
                         the chickens... fucking Hal says no, 
                         no the old battle axe at home will 
                         break my balls... I gotta get my ass 
                         home.

               The kids stare in shock at Grampa. Jerry begins to laugh.

                                     GRAMPA
                         So, I tell 'im... Hal, here's the 
                         secret. Go home tonight, crawl into 
                         bed, get under the covers and eat 
                         your wife's pussy... I mean jam your 
                         face right in the bush.

               Jerry starts to giggle.

                                     DENISE
                              (quietly)
                         What are you laughing at?

                                     JERRY
                         I don't know, I think he's funny.

                                     DENISE
                         This isn't funny, it's twisted.

                                     GRAMPA
                         So, Hal goes home, jumps in, starts 
                         chomping and licking away at her 
                         pussy, she's screaming and howling... 
                         totally passes out from the 
                         experience.

                                     MARY
                         Dear God, let this end.

                                     GRAMPA
                         Now, Hal... He's feeling pretty good, 
                         so he goes into the bathroom for a 
                         quick shave...
                              (pauses)
                         ...suddenly he lets out a horrible 
                         scream. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

               The recorded crowd chuckles.

                                     GRAMPA
                         Sitting there on the toilet is Hal's 
                         wife Gloria... and she says, "Quiet 
                         down, you'll wake Grandma!"

               The recorded crowd screams with laughter, as does Jerry.  
               Bill, Denise and Mary look at him like he's crazy.

                                     GRAMPA
                         Thank you, you're too kind, too 
                         kind... stay in your seats, coming 
                         up next we got something special for 
                         you men out there.

               The curtains close and the stage goes dark.

                                     DENISE
                         Shit, I'm all for being a sport, but 
                         this is ridiculous.

                                     BILL
                              (looking at his watch)
                         Man, it's already ten thirty.

                                     MARY
                         I'm with Denise, can't we just walk 
                         to someplace, this is getting fucking 
                         stupid.

                                     JERRY
                         Negative. Shit, we are so deep in 
                         the sticks we could walk for hours 
                         and find zero.

                                     BILL
                         Yeah, I'd say at this point all we 
                         can do is just wait it out. There's 
                         nothing else.

                                     DENISE
                         I suppose. I mean they're obviously 
                         all bonkers, but I guess they're 
                         harmless.

                                     MARY
                         I fucking hope so.

               The stage lights come up. The recorded applause and music 
               begin.

               Baby enters the stage. She is dressed in a home-made showgirl 
               outfit. She begins to dance clumsily to the music. She appears 
               to be somewhat intoxicated.

               The vocals come on and Baby begins to lipsync to the song.

                                     DENISE
                         You gotta be kidding me. This chick 
                         is wasted.

                                     JERRY
                         Shhhhhh.

                                     MARY
                         How much is a person supposed to 
                         stand?

                                     BILL
                              (motioning for Mary 
                              to keep her voice 
                              down)
                         Quiet.

                                     MARY
                              (sarcastically)
                         Oh, I'm sorry, bothering you? Was I 
                         disturbing your viewing pleasure?

               Baby makes her way down from stage on to floor level. She 
               gyrates and seductively TEASES one of the dummy audience 
               members.

               Baby moves over to Jerry. Stroking her hand down his face. 
               Denise tries to look amused. Jerry smiles uncomfortably.

               Baby strolls past Denise and stops in front of Mary.

               Baby pauses and pinches Mary's cheek and winks. Mary is 
               FURIOUS.

               Baby moves over to Bill. Mary watches like a mother hawk.

               Baby sings and dances with all of her attention focused on 
               Bill.

               Baby puts her arms around Bill's neck and sits on his lap. 
               Mary BOLTS FORWARD and SHOVES Baby off of Bill.

               Baby crashes onto the floor.

                                     MARY
                         Take that, you fucking slut!
                              (Mary spits at Baby)
                         Fucking redneck whore!

                                     BABY
                         You shouldn't a done that.

                                     MARY
                         Why? You gonna do something about 
                         it?

                                     BABY
                              (standing up)
                         Yeah, I'll do something.

               Baby takes out a straight razor from behind her back.

                                     BABY
                         I'll cut your fucking tits off and 
                         shove 'em down your throat.

                                     MOTHER
                         Baby! Stop!

               Mrs. Firefly runs down from her position behind the spotlight 
               and intercedes.

                                     BABY
                         Come on, ma... this bitch's got it 
                         coming.

                                     MOTHER
                         No, I told you...

               SCREECH! The garage door slides open. Rufus has returned.

                                     RUFUS JR.
                              (interrupting)
                         Car's done.

                                     DENISE
                         Thank God.

                                     MOTHER
                         I suggest you kids leave now.

                                     MARY
                         Don't worry, I'm gone.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

               Bill, Jerry, Denise and Mary climb back into their car.

                                     BILL
                         Don't look back, just get in the 
                         car.

                                     DENISE
                         Lock the fucking doors.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Bill begins to pull the car down the long dirt driveway 
               towards the road. The heavy rain makes visibility difficult.

                                     BILL
                              (straining to see 
                              through the darkness)
                         Almost there.

                                     JERRY
                         Jesus, you think she was really gonna 
                         cut you?

                                     MARY
                              (leaning her forehead 
                              on the window)
                         Of course she was gonna cut me, she's 
                         a fucking nut...
                              (closes her eyes and 
                              takes a breath)
                         I knew she was crazy from the second 
                         we picked her up.

               SLAM! Suddenly, Baby pounds her fist against Mary's window. 
               Mary jumps back in terror.

                                     BABY
                              (screaming)
                         You're in Hell, bitch! You're gonna 
                         die like a dog!

               Baby disappears into the darkness.

                                     MARY
                         Go! Go! Go! Get us out of here!

               Bill pulls the car up to the front gate. It is chained shut 
               with a huge padlock.

               LIGHTNING CRASHES, illuminating the crucified scarecrows.

               FLASH CLOSE-UP CUTS - of grinning jack-o-lantern faces peer 
               down from above.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Bill opens the car door, starts to get out.

                                     MARY
                              (hysterical)
                         What are you doing!

                                     BILL
                         I gotta open the gate.

                                     MARY
                         Drive through it!

                                     BILL
                         It won't work.

                                     JERRY
                         Holy fuck, hurry up.

               Jerry, Mary and Denise watch through the windshield as Bill 
               struggles to unlatch the thick iron gates.

               SUDDENLY, one of the SCARECROWS JUMPS down from his cross 
               and SMASHES Bill over the head with a HEAVY CLUB. Bill drops 
               to his knees.

                                     MARY
                         Bill! Help him!

               Jerry throws open his door to get out. He's SHOVED BACK into 
               the car by another, larger scarecrow outside his door. This 
               scarecrow begins smashing the car's windows with a METAL 
               PIPE.

               Bill lays motionless, face down in the mud. His attacker 
               turns his attention on the car. He also begins smashing the 
               car's windows.

               EXT. CAR - NIGHT

               From a distance we see Jerry pulled from the car and beaten. 
               The girls are helplessly trapped inside the destroyed vehicle. 
               The scarecrows continue to pound on the car.

               As we fade out, the sound of a BARKING DOG can be heard.

                                                                   FADE TO:

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - MAGIC

               From a long shot, we see the farmhouse in the early morning 
               sunrise. All is still.

               The sound of an engine starting breaks the early morning 
               silence. Rufus's tow truck is seen pulling away from behind 
               the house. The BEATEN REMAINS of Bill's car are towed behind 
               it.

               EXT. WILLIS HOUSE - SUNRISE

               Darkness, except for the face of an alarm clock. The time is 
               7:00 AM. TICK, TICK, TICK... BUZZZZZZ. The alarm goes off.

               A hand reaches over and turns off the alarm. We hear a deep 
               groan. A light turns on.

               INT. WILLIS'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

               Don Willis wakes up, having fallen asleep in his easy chair. 
               He sits up and wipes the sleep from his eyes. He runs a hand 
               across his head, smoothing out his thinning grey hair.

               He picks up a phone next to his bed, dials a number, waits.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Hi. Lieutenant Broekman please... 
                         Donald Willis.

               He holds.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Hey, Phil...
                              (listens)
                         Yeah, I'm alright... but I need you 
                         to check on something for me.

               Willis stands, walks to the window, opens the shades, morning 
               sun fills the room.

               shelf by the window is cluttered with framed photographs. 
               B+W memories of Denise at the beach, RUDY the dog. High school 
               graduations and Donald Willis in uniform with the other 
               members of 56 Precinct. Donald is a FORMER POLICE OFFICER.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         I'm a little worried about Denise. 
                         She called me last night from the 
                         road, out by Ruggsville at some joint 
                         called Spaulding's or something like 
                         that, said she'd be here about 
                         eleven... but she never showed up.

               Paces.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Yeah, if you could run a check on up 
                         that way and see about any accidents 
                         or road closing or anything, I'd 
                         really appreciate it...
                              (listening)
                         ...yeah, yeah, I know... I'm sure 
                         nothing happened but, you know me I 
                         like to worry... thanks... bye.

               Hangs up the phone.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - OTIS'S ROOM - DAY

               Mary opens her eyes, squinting into the light. Sunlight peers 
               through filth on the windows, fractured by the tattered 
               remains of rotted curtains. Peeling yellowed newspaper serves 
               as wallpaper surrounding the window.

               Mary's eyes move across the walls to a painting of a BIG 
               EYED KITTEN. She stares at it and smiles. A look of horror 
               begins to appear on her face. She begins to scream 
               uncontrollably.

                                     OTIS
                              (off screen)
                         Shut your fucking mouth!

               She is hysterical.

                                     OTIS
                         I said shut your mouth!

               ZOOM BACK to see Mary wearing a dunce cap, tied to a chair, 
               facing a corner in the farmhouse's attic. This is Otis's art 
               studio.

               Otis, standing before a large canvas, sets down his paint 
               brush and calmly walks over to Mary.

               He spins her chair around, clamps her mouth shut with his 
               hand and leans his nose against hers.

                                     OTIS
                              (slow and sinister)
                         Listen, you Malibu Barbie middle 
                         class piece of shit. I'm trying to 
                         work, you got me, work... you ever 
                         work?

               Mary's eyes scream with terror, she nods yes.

                                     OTIS
                         Yeah, I'll bet you did. Scooping ice 
                         cream to your shitheel friends on 
                         summer break... well, I ain't talking 
                         about white socks with Mickey Mouse 
                         on one side and Donald Duck on the 
                         other... shit, you ain't reading no 
                         funny books, mamma.

               Otis raises his paint covered hand.

                                     OTIS
                         This is blood and guts, Suzy Q. Our 
                         bodies come and go, but this blood 
                         is forever...
                              (pulls a small book 
                              from his breast pocket)
                         ...let me read you something, listen 
                         and learn... you listening?

               Otis pulls back his hand, ready to backhand her across the 
               face with the book. She nods again. He lowers the book.

                                     OTIS
                              (gesturing dramatically)
                         And the angels, all pallid and wan, 
                         Uprising, unveiling, affirm That the 
                         play is the tragedy "Man" And its 
                         hero the Conqueror Worm...
                              (pauses)
                         ...you get that? Art is eternal, you 
                         get me, mamma?

               Mary stares dumbfounded.

                                     OTIS
                         Now, I'm gonna remove my hand... you 
                         make a sound and I swear I'll slit 
                         you open and make you eat your own 
                         fucking intestines... you get me?

               She nods again. He slowly removes his hand from her mouth. 
               Mary tries to remain calm, but starts to hyperventilate. 
               Tears roll down her face.

                                     MARY
                              (whispering)
                         Why? Why are you doing this?

                                     OTIS
                         Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, 
                         fuck lady there are some bigger issues 
                         at hand... than your fucking have a 
                         nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!

                                     MARY
                         Where's Bill?

                                     OTIS
                              (chuckling)
                         Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's 
                         been great help to me... a real 
                         blessing... I couldn't have asked 
                         for a better specimen. I mean you 
                         don't know what a dry spell I've 
                         had, total block...
                              (slaps his forehead)
                         ...total block... but Bill he's OK.

               Mary looks confused, but relieved.

                                     MARY
                              (softly)
                         Where is he?

                                     OTIS
                         Let's go see.

               Otis grabs the back of the chair and drags her across the 
               room towards a curtained off area.

               Whoosh! He pulls her through the curtains. From behind the 
               curtain we hear Mary SCREAMING and Otis LAUGHING.

                                     MARY
                              (behind curtain)
                         Bill? No, no, no! What have you done? 
                         Bill!

               INT. CURTAIN ROOM - OTIS'S ROOM - DAY

               Ugliness. Decay. Pain. Carefully arranged on a model's 
               platform is the severed torso of Bill sewn to a large homemade 
               fish tail. He is lying on his ride side posing.

               Bill's face is frozen in a death scream.

                                     OTIS
                         Behold... The Fish-Boy!

                                     MARY
                              (repeating to herself)
                         This can't be real, this can't be 
                         real, this can't be real.

                                     OTIS
                         Oh, it's real... as real as I want 
                         it to be, mamma...
                              (grabs his canvas and 
                              holds it in her face)
                         ...look, see the magic in my brush 
                         strokes.

               Painted on the canvas is the gruesome scene of Bill as the 
               Fish-Boy.

                                     MARY
                              (crying)
                         Fuck you, you fucking freak!

                                     OTIS
                         Oh, come now... we're all creatures 
                         of God and freaks in our own way...
                              (twitches and shakes)
                         ...but if you'll notice...
                              (points to a blank 
                              spot in the painting)
                         right here, needs a little something, 
                         heh?

               Otis slowly puts down the canvas, turns and picks up a huge 
               hunting knife.

                                     MARY
                         What are you doing?
                              (squirming)
                         ...no, stop... please, please.

                                     OTIS
                         You, my dear worm feeder, are about 
                         to become immortalized.

               Otis draws back the knife.

                                     MARY
                              (screaming)
                         Noooooooooooo!

               Otis swings the knife forward, directly into the camera.

               CLOSE UP - CLOWN FACE

               Ravelli's clown head bobs back and forth.

               PULL BACK TO:

               Ravelli, wearing his clown head, stands by the road side 
               waving to passing cars.

               EXT. SPAULDING'S - DAY

               A police car drives past Ravelli and comes to a stop. OFFICER 
               GEORGE WYDELL, 42, a big, slightly paunchy man with a big 
               mustache and mirrored sunglasses, steps from his car.

               Following close behind, OFFICER STEVE NAISH, 29, tall 
               athletic.

                                     WYDELL
                              (pauses, looks around, 
                              pulls up his belt)
                         Well, let's go see if the nut that 
                         runs this place can help us.

                                     NAISH
                         Right.

               They walk to the door.

               The door swings open. Wydell enters slowly, putting on his 
               best cowboy attitude. Naish follows suit.

               Wydell, hands on his belt, struts up to the counter.

               No one is around.

               A rusted bell sits on the counter, taped to it is a 
               handwritten note, "ring for service". Wydell rings it once, 
               waits, no response. Rings it again, waits, no response.

                                     NAISH
                              (looking around the 
                              room)
                         Get a load of all this crap... this 
                         is one sick place.

               Wydell begins ringing the bell non-stop.

               Spaulding shouts from the backroom.

                         Whoever's a jerking off on that bell 
                         better be gone when I get out there... 
                         'cause I'm gonna rip your nuts off.

               Spaulding enters from behind the curtain, angry. He sees the 
               troopers and puts on a phony grin.

               Behind the wheel is Rufus Jr., riding shotgun is Baby, dressed

               Baby and Rufus stand at the counter waiting for the CASHIER, 
               a skinny geek with glasses, to total up their purchases. The 
               counter is loaded with bottles.

               The cashier is packing the bottles into cardboard boxes.

                         Yeah, maybe it was fucking aliens.

               EXT. PINK PUSSY CAT LIQUOR - MIDDAY

               Baby and Rufus exit. Rufus loads the boxes into the back of 
               the truck. Baby sits on the curb and lights a cigarette.

               EXT. CHERRYPICKER ROAD - WOODS - MIDDAY

               Bill's car is now sitting in the middle of the road. The 
               back is attached to a police tow truck. An additional police 
               cruiser arrives on the scene.

               Sheriff Huston steps out from his cruiser.

                                     HUSTON
                         What'd we here, Georgie?

                                     WYDELL
                         A vehicle registered to a William S. 
                         Hudley.

                                     HUSTON
                         Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves 
                         a field day beating the shit outta 
                         this thing.

                                     WYDELL
                         Yeah, no mercy here.

                                     HUSTON
                         Recover any bodies?

                                     WYDELL
                         Not yet.

                                     HUSTON
                              (inspecting the car)
                         Shit, I wonder what these kids did 
                         to bring this much hell down on 'em.

                                     WYDELL
                         Just in the wrong place at the wrong 
                         time.

                                     HUSTON
                         That's the understatement of the 
                         year.

                                     WYDELL
                         Yep, I suppose it is.

               INT. BILL'S CAR - WOODS - MIDDAY

               Naish is digging around under the front seat.

                                     NAISH
                         Hey, I found something.

               Naish crawls out of the car.

               EXT. CHERRYPICKER ROAD - WOODS - MIDDAY

                                     HUSTON
                         What'd ya got there?

                                     NAISH
                         Keys.

                                     HUSTON
                         Well Christ boy, don't stand there 
                         like a prize dog dick with his 
                         butthole caught up a tree.

                                     NAISH
                         Huh?

                                     HUSTON
                         Open up the trunk.

                                     NAISH
                         Yes, sir.

                                     WYDELL
                         Toss 'em over here.

               Naish tosses them over the car to Wydell. Wydell fishes 
               through the keys, finds the trunk key and opens it.

                                     WYDELL
                              (winces)
                         God damn.

                                     HUSTON
                         You find something, Georgie?

                                     WYDELL
                              (disgusted)
                         Yep, I found something.

               We move around the car to see the nude body of Karen Murphy 
               laying in the trunk. Her arms and legs are hog tied. She is 
               dead. The word TRICK is carved into her side.

               INT. FARMHOUSE BASEMENT - TINY'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Water drips down from the leaking pipes above. Scavenging 
               rats scurry across the concrete floor.

               In a far corner a single light burns, a child's Humpty Dumpty 
               lamp, illuminating --

               Denise is strapped to an old wooden bed. She has been stripped 
               of her own clothes and is now wearing a blue checked little 
               girl's dress. Her hair is tied in pigtails.

               She is cold and shivering.

               BOOM. The basement door opens, heavy footsteps lumber down 
               the creaking stairs. It is Tiny.

               Tiny is wearing an orange T-shirt that reads, "This is my 
               Halloween costume". For the first time we see the skin on 
               his arms, it is severely deformed from burn scars.

               He is holding a small tray. On the tray is a box of cereal, 
               milk, a bowl and a spoon.

               Tiny goes over to Denise, sets down the tray, and proudly 
               displays his T-shirt.

                                     DENISE
                              (hoarse and dry)
                         Please... Tiny, please. Let me go... 
                         help me.

               Tiny sits down on a stool next to the bed, he stares down at 
               Denise like a confused dog.

                                     DENISE
                              (crying)
                         Please, God please.

               Tiny begins preparing her food, carefully pouring the cereal 
               and milk into the bowl. He stirs it with the spoon.

               Tiny gently lifts Denise's head and feeds her like a baby. 
               Denise swallows the food, trying not to choke. After a few 
               spoonfuls Tiny stands up and walks over to a dark corner of 
               the room.

               He pulls a string and turns on a swinging ceiling light. In 
               the light we see a rusty cage, inside are three rail-thin 
               female bodies.

               Tiny throws the remainder of the cereal into the cage.

               One of the bodies moves to eat the scraps, the others do 
               not. They are dead.

               Tiny turns off the overhead light.

               INT. POLICE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

               Wydell and Naish are pulling into a large truck stop parking 
               lot.

                                     NAISH
                         You sure this guy's supposed to ride 
                         with us? Seems kind of weird.

                                     WYDELL
                              (scanning the parking 
                              lot)
                         Chief said pick him up and take him 
                         with us on our house to house. Guy's 
                         an ex-cop, thinks he can help.

                                     NAISH
                         Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally 
                         just get in the way.

                                     WYDELL
                         Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit 
                         on the sidelines and wait when your 
                         own kid's missing... besides, ain't 
                         no such thing as an ex-cop.

                                     NAISH
                         I guess not.

                                     WYDELL
                         That must be him.

               EXT. GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

               A rundown gas station sits off to the side of the road.

               A filthy mechanic works on one of the many junked cars.

               Two fat greasy men sit in the hot sun playing cards.

               A Chevy Nova sits parked next to the station. Willis leans 
               against the side of the car, drinking coffee from a styrofoam 
               cup.

               A police cruiser pulls up. Wydell and Naish step from the 
               car.

                                     WYDELL
                         Mr. Willis?

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Yes, sir.

                                     WYDELL
                         I'm Wydell... this is Naish.

               Wydell extends his hand, they shake hands.

                                     NAISH
                         Hey.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         George Willis...
                              (to Wydell)
                         ...any leads?

                                     WYDELL
                         Well, we were on our way out to run 
                         a check on a couple farmhouses out 
                         on the edge of town... closest thing 
                         we got to a lead at this point.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         That's it?

                                     WYDELL
                         Well, all we know is the kids were 
                         headed out to a spot the locals call 
                         Deadwood to play Nancy Drew with 
                         some local legend about this character 
                         everybody calls Dr. Satan.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Dr. Satan?

                                     NAISH
                         Yeah it's horseshit, just some 
                         boogieman crap that the kids like to 
                         scare each other with.

                                     WYDELL
                         Anyway, there's not much else out 
                         that way... so, I figure maybe there's 
                         a chance the kids broke down and 
                         found their way over to one of the 
                         farms.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         What about the body you found?

                                     WYDELL
                              (slightly surprised)
                         Oh, yeah, you know about that? Hmmm, 
                         that's a strange one.

                                     NAISH
                         Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing 
                         for a couple months, figured for a 
                         runaway.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Fit the profile?

                                     NAISH
                         No, not really. Good kid, never been 
                         in any trouble.

                                     WYDELL
                         Her part in this I can't figure... 
                         but I will.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                              (wipes his brow)
                         Christ, you know it's crazy...
                              (gets choked up)
                         I lived through so many other people's 
                         nightmares, you know. Always cool 
                         and calm, but... but I never thought 
                         I'd be the one needing help, ya know?

                                     NAISH
                         Don't worry, we'll find her.

                                     WYDELL
                         Let's hit the road, sooner we get a 
                         move on sooner we'll find her.

               Willis dumps out the remaining coffee, tosses the cup into 
               the trash and opens the back door of the police car. He gets 
               inside. Wydell and Naish climb in. The car drives off.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - OTIS'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               THUMP!

               CLOSE UP on a bloody, bandaged face. THUMP!

               As we pull back to see Jerry, completely bandaged like a 
               mummy, strapped to a wall. His arms and legs are spread. 
               THUMP! Knives stick in the wall next to the body.

                                     GRAMPA
                              (off screen)
                         God damn bitch, what the fuck are 
                         you waiting for... Charles Nelson 
                         Reilly don't know shit...

               We pull back further to see Otis pacing wildly back and forth 
               in front of his TV, watching MATCH GAME. Grampa sits eating 
               a TV dinner.

                                     OTIS
                              (gesturing at the TV 
                              with a knife)
                         Watch that bitch, she's thinking 
                         about that Klugman bangin' Brett 
                         Sommers, pick motherfucking Richard 
                         Dawson.

               Otis throws the large hunting knife at the wall next to Jerry.

                                     OTIS

                         Christ, four kids couldn't just 
                         disappear.

                                     NAISH
                         No they couldn't, somebody had to 
                         see something.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         My Denise is a smart girl, she 
                         wouldn't do anything stupid, and her 
                         boyfriend, he always seemed like a 
                         good kid.

                                     WYDELL
                         I'm sure there's a logical 
                         explanation.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         I pray to God there is.

                         Turn up this road.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Where we headed?

                                     WYDELL
                         I seem to remember another farm set 
                         way back off the road where the car 
                         was found. I'm not sure if anyone 
                         lives there anymore, but it's worth 
                         a look.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Wydell's cruiser turns up the road to the Firefly farmhouse. 
               It moves past the scarecrows and comes to a halt. The doors 
               swing open and Wydell, Naish and Willis get out.

                                     WYDELL
                         I'm gonna see if anybody's home. You 
                         and Mr. Willis take a look around 
                         the grounds for any sign of anything.

                                     NAISH
                         Right...
                              (to Willis)
                         ...come on.

               Naish and Willis head off around the back of the house.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

               Dirty dishes overflow from the rusty metal sink onto the 
               surrounding counters. A large cat walks across piles of food 
               left to rot on a table. Boxes of trash and old newspapers 
               are stacked to the ceiling.

               Music from a crackling radio is heard.

               Mother stands stirring a large pot on the stove. A LOUD 
               knocking interrupts her cooking. She sets down her spoon and 
               walks to the front door.

               Before opening the door she peeks through the curtains of a 
               small side window. She sees Wydell and runs from the kitchen.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Wydell walks up the front steps.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

               Mother runs toward a door at the end of the hall. She swings 
               open the door.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - OTIS'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Mother bursts into the room.

                                     MOTHER
                         Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops 
                         outside.

                                     OTIS
                         What! God damn, how many?

                              (watching TV)
                         What? How many?

                                     OTIS
                         Don't worry about it.

               Otis jumps up and goes over to an old dresser and opens a 
               drawer and pulls out an automatic revolver.

                                     MOTHER
                         I don't know. I only saw one.

                                     OTIS
                         I'm sure there's more than that... 
                         fucking pigs always travel in packs...

                              Mother)

                              (takes the gun)
                         What should I do?

                                     OTIS
                         Go down stairs and play nice... I'm 
                         a gonna go 'round back and handle 
                         things like I always fucking do.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

               Naish and Willis move through the cluttered back yard of 
               garbage.

                                     NAISH
                         Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies 
                         throw anything away?

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Shhhh... you hear that?

               The soft sound of moaning can be heard.

                                     NAISH
                         Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming 
                         from?

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Over here, inside the smokehouse.

               Naish and Willis stand in front of a brick smokehouse. The 
               thick door is chained shut.

                                     NAISH
                              (knocking on door)
                         Anybody in there?

               The moaning gets louder.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         We gotta break it open.

                                     NAISH
                         I ain't got a warrant.

               Willis picks up a broken axe handle and begins prying open 
               the door.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Tell it to my daughter.

               Together they struggle to open the door.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

               Mother slowly opens the front door. The revolver is behind 
               her back, tucked in her apron strings.

                                     MOTHER

                         you this fine afternoon.

                                     MOTHER
                         Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it 
                         kind of looks like rain, don't ya 
                         think?

                         My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to 
                         ask you a few questions.

                                     MOTHER
                         Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you 
                         anything you want to know.

                                     WYDELL
                         I appreciate your cooperation. I'm 
                         looking for a missing girl...
                              (holds up picture)
                         ...this girl here, Denise Willis... 
                         have you seen her?

                                     MOTHER
                         Well, I... mmmmm... no, I ain't seen 
                         her, sorry.

               She begins to close the door. Wydell stops her.

                                     WYDELL
                         Please, could I please come in and 
                         talk to you for a minute? Maybe you 
                         could take a better look at the 
                         picture... might stir up something.

                                     MOTHER

                                     WYDELL
                         Please, just a minute.

                                     MOTHER
                         Oh, alright... I guess I can trust 
                         you... being a man of the law and 
                         all.

               She opens the door.

                                     WYDELL
                         Thank you.

                                     MOTHER

                         knows how I love a man in uniform.

               She closes the door.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

               Naish and Willis bust open the door to the smokehouse. Hanging 
               upside down inside is Mary. She hangs from ropes strapped to 
               the ceiling. Large hunks of meat hang around her in the 
               cramped room.

                         Call Wydell.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

               Wydell and Mother sit opposite eachother at the kitchen table. 
               Pictures of Denise and her companions are spread on the table. 
               Wydell takes notes as Mother talks.

                                     WYDELL
                         Think... do any of these kids look 
                         familiar in any way?

                                     MOTHER
                         No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em 
                         before...
                              (points to the photo 
                              of Bill)
                         ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?

               Suddenly, Naish's voice comes over Wydell's walkie-talkie.

                                     NAISH
                         Wydell.

                         Excuse me for a second.

               Pulls walkie-talkie from his belt to respond.

                                     WYDELL
                         Over.

                         We found one.

               Click. Mother points the gun at Wydell's head and fires.

               He falls dead to the floor.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

               Naish hears the commotion over his walkie-talkie.

                                     NAISH
                              (into walkie-talkie)
                         Wydell! Over! Wydell! Over!

               No response.

                                     NAISH
                         Fuck, go to the car... call for 
                         backup. Tell 'em officer down.

                                     MR. WILLIS
                         Right.

               Willis runs to the car, he gets about halfway there before 
               he is hit in the back by a bullet. He stumbles and falls to 
               his knees.

               He kneels silent, stunned. We hold on his face and watch as 
               his life passes before him.

               A quick MONTAGE, we see the following images flash by:

               A. A father and daughter together in happier times.

               B. A child's birthday party.

               C. A baby crying.

               D. Willis and his deceased wife.

               Otis fires another shot.

               Willis falls forward into the mud, dead.

               Naish sees Willis fall. Before he can react a voice calls 
               out from behind him.

                                     OTIS
                         Hands up, bitch!

               Naish raises his hands.

                                     OTIS
                         Turn around, real slow... piggy-pie.

               Naish turns around.

                                     OTIS
                         Interlock your fingers behind your 
                         head...
                              (Naish hesitates)
                         ...do it!

               Naish obeys.

                                     OTIS
                         Kneel.

               Naish kneels down.

               From a distance we see Otis standing over Naish, execution 
               style. A white puff of smoke comes from Otis's gun and a 
               distant popping sound is heard. Naish falls over on his side.

               The scene fades to blood red.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

               The house stands silent in the darkness. Lightning crashes, 
               a heavy rain falls.

               Burning JACK-O'-LANTERNS beam from every window. Smoke rises 
               from the chimney.

               It is Halloween night.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

               CLOSE-UP TV

               Dr. Wolfenstein is on screen smashing pumpkins with a giant 
               hammer.

                                     DR. WOLFENSTEIN
                         It is midnight my little boils and 
                         ghouls, the witching hour. Time for 
                         all monsters, murderers, maniacs and 
                         madmen to go to work... so lock your 
                         doors and bolt your windows, sit 
                         back and prepare for a fright night 
                         classic...
                              (lightning crashes)
                         ...The House of Frankenstein.

               The movie begins and we move off the TV to see:

               Hundreds of CANDLES are lit, illuminating everything with a 
               flickering light. Music blares from a cheap stereo. BLACK 
               and ORANGE PAPER STREAMERS are draped from ceiling to floor.

               Dead center is a LARGE OBJECT standing seven feet tall, it 
               is completely covered in paper Halloween decorations. A long 
               chain connects the object up into the rafters.

               This is the Halloween party from Hell.

               An intoxicated Grampa, dressed as FLASH GORDON, sits in his 
               wheelchair watching the TV, drinking MOONSHINE from an 
               unmarked bottle.

                                     GRAMPA
                              (slurred drunken 
                              yelling at the screen)
                         Get those motherfucker... those high 
                         water bitches and rocketship 
                         daisies... kill 'em, kill 'em.

               CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! Tiny stands in a corner tunelessly 
               banging on a large oil drum. He is dressed like a low budget 
               BATMAN, in grey long johns and a black bat mask and cape.

               A drunk Rufus, wearing a bloody police uniform, stands on a 
               table SHOUTING along to the music through a POLICE MEGAPHONE.

               Mother and Baby, both dressed as SUPERHEROES, dance around 
               the covered object. Both are swigging moonshine from jugs.

                                     RUFUS JR.
                              (shouting through 
                              megaphone)
                         Show me, show me, show me, show me!

               Mother and Baby start TEARING AWAY the paper covering from 
               the object in the middle of the room. They RIP at the paper, 
               spinning and dancing around in a wild pagan ritual.

               As the shreds of colored paper fall to the floor we see: 
               Denise, Jerry and Mary tied back to back hanging from the 
               chain, each are dressed in a different animal costume. Denise 
               is a pig, Jerry is a donkey and Mary is a rabbit. They are 
               gagged.

               Mother and Baby laugh at their helpless victims, splashing 
               moonshine in their faces.

                                     BABY
                         Drink up, it's party time.

                                     MOTHER
                         Enjoy your last night...
                              (looking around)
                         ...where's Otis?

                                     BABY
                         Oh, he's coming, he got something 
                         real special this year.

               Rufus jumps down, begins to spin the bound captives around 
               and around.

                                     RUFUS JR.
                         Otis, Otis, Otis, Otis!

                                     MOTHER
                         Quiet, quiet, you know he won't come 
                         down with all this hoop-dee-doo 
                         bouncing off the walls. Now, calm 
                         down.

                                     GRAMPA
                         I shot an elephant in my pajamas 
                         this morning... how he got in my 
                         pajamas I'll never know.

                                     BABY
                         Grampa, shhhhhhhh.

                                     GRAMPA
                         Then we tried to remove the tusks, 
                         but they were embedded in so firmly 
                         that we couldn't budge 'em.

                                     MOTHER
                              (gesturing at Grampa)
                         Let him finish.

                                     GRAMPA
                         Of course, in Alabama the Tuscaloosa, 
                         but that's entirely irrelephant.

               The room goes silent. All eyes are focused on the stairs.

               A robed figure, Otis, appears at the top of the stairs, he 
               begins to descend.

               Rufus waits at the bottom of the stairs. As Otis reaches the 
               last step Rufus hands him the megaphone.

               Denise, Mary and Jerry struggle to watch as they in turn 
               rotate past the scene unfolding.

                                     OTIS
                              (through the megaphone)
                         I'm the one who brings the Christmas 
                         candy... now tell me
                              (pauses and raises 
                              his arms)
                         ...Who's your Daddy?

               Otis walks closer to the rotating captives.

                                     OTIS
                         I'm the one who brings the devil's 
                         brandy...
                              (waits)

                                     MOTHER
                         Who's your Daddy!

                                     OTIS
                         Yes! I'm the one who beats you when 
                         you're bad...

                                     BABY
                         Who's your Daddy!

                                     MOTHER
                         Who's your Daddy!

               Otis stops the spinning of his prisoners and stands directly 
               before Denise.

               He drops his robe, underneath he is wearing a SUIT OF SKIN 
               sewn together from pieces of Denise's father.

               Denise stares in horror, tears stream down her cheeks, barely 
               able to comprehend the madness around her.

               Otis moves in close and licks her across the face.

                                     OTIS
                         I'm the one who loves you when you're 
                         fucking dead!

               Everyone chants "Who's your Daddy?"

                                     OTIS
                              (imitating Willis)
                         Now, I say my little darlings...
                              (rotates the chain to 
                              Mary)
                         maybe prancing around where you don't 
                         belong ain't such a winner of an 
                         idea...
                              (slaps Mary across 
                              the face)

               Slowly turns the chain to face Jerry.

                                     OTIS
                         And you, the great rusher of fools, 
                         what were you after...
                              (slaps Jerry)
                         Huh, speak to me...
                              (slaps him again)
                         Oh, that's right, Dr. Satan... 
                         everybody got to know about Dr. Satan, 
                         Jesus Christ, let the old dog rest 
                         for fuck sake, he's already got one 
                         foot in the grave and the other's 
                         tap dancing around the edge...
                              (gets nose to nose 
                              with Jerry)
                         ...well, I can see the disappointment 
                         on your sad little puppy face... so 
                         I'm gonna do you a favor, a big, big 
                         favor. You owe me, boy. I'm gonna 
                         let you meet the old bastard.

                                     GRAMPA
                         That's a horse's ass alright, I told 
                         you.

               Jerry's eyes widen in fear.

                                     OTIS
                         Baby, roll that old love machine 
                         over here, so this boy can meet his 
                         hero.

               Baby rolls Grampa over to Jerry.

                                     OTIS
                              (lifts his skin mask)
                         You see it's all true, the boogieman 
                         is real and you found him...
                              (Jerry stares in shock)
                         ...why so sad? Isn't this what you 
                         begged for? There he is, the living 
                         legend himself, ta da Dr. Satan. 
                         Now, don't get shy on me... ask your 
                         hero some questions, don't blow this 
                         last in a lifetime opportunity.

                                     GRAMPA
                         Zarkoff, I will conquer the sea, the 
                         air, the earth... the universe.

               Mother moves in close to Jerry.

                                     MOTHER
                         Look at the way he lights up... Grampa 
                         just loves meeting his fans.

               Otis grabs Jerry's cheeks and makes his face move like a 
               ventriloquist dummy, provides Jerry's voice.

                                     OTIS
                         Aw gee whiz, I'm so excited... I 
                         really think you're the coolest... 
                         you're tops on the playground, cooler 
                         than the Fonzie.

               Baby grabs Mary and does the same ventriloquist routine.

                                     BABY
                         Oh, oh pick me, pick me... I have a 
                         question.

               Baby rotates Mary around to where Gramps is seated.

                                     BABY
                              (squeezing Mary's 
                              face, hard)
                         I was wondering Mr. Satan sir, do 
                         you like to kiss on the first date 
                         or is that considered slutty?

                                     GRAMPA
                         What the fuck are you saying? Who 
                         the hell is talking to me?

               Tiny, growing restless, begins banging on his metal drum. 
               KLANG - KLANG - KLANG. Rufus joins in, clapping his hands.

                                     MOTHER
                         Come on, my babies are getting 
                         restless.

                                     RUFUS JR.
                         Dump in the pit, dump in the pit, 
                         dump in the pit.

               Mother, Baby, Grampa join in chanting with Rufus.

                                     OTIS
                         Alright, alright. Cut 'em down, it's 
                         time they get what they came here 
                         for.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               The rain pounds down. A heavy fog hovers over the dense growth 
               of the field. In the distance, silhouetted by moonlight, a 
               gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night.

               Otis, lantern in hand, leads the way. Followed by Baby and 
               Mother together under a large black umbrella. Next Rufus 
               holds the leash connected to Jerry, Denise and Mary.

               Bringing up the rear, Tiny, shotgun focused on the prisoners, 
               and Grampa. Grampa is strapped to Tiny's back like a child. 
               He waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam.

               The group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure.

                                     OTIS
                              (handing Baby the 
                              lantern)
                         Hold this. Point it over here.

               Baby directs the light at Otis. We see that he is trying to 
               unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron door embedded in 
               the base of the wooden structure.

               Otis unlocks the door and swings it open. He reaches down 
               into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook and wench, 
               attached to the hook is a chain.

               Otis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to the pit 
               to reveal a rusty metal crank. He begins to turn the crank. 
               Slowly, from out of the pit, rises a coffin hanging from the 
               end of the chain.

               Otis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the ground. 
               He flips open the lid.

                                     OTIS
                         Hey happy-boy, step your ass up here.

               Rufus cuts loose Jerry, but holds him steady by the neck.

                                     BABY
                         Take his gag out, it's more fun with 
                         the screaming.

                                     MOTHER
                         Yeah, I like the screaming too... 
                         it's so much more exciting.

               Rufus cuts loose the gag.

                                     JERRY
                         Please don't kill us, please don't 
                         kill us.

                                     BABY
                              (imitating Jerry)
                         Please don't kill us, please don't 
                         kill us.

                                     OTIS
                         Bitch, shut your mouth and get your 
                         shit in the box.

                                     JERRY
                         Let us go, please... let the girls 
                         go.

                                     BABY
                              (imitating Jerry)
                         Let us go, please... let the girls 
                         go.

               Otis pulls out a gun and points it at Jerry.

                                     OTIS
                         Get in... now!

                                     MOTHER
                         Wait, I want to say good-bye.

               Mother grabs Jerry by the collar and gives him a big kiss.

                                     MOTHER
                         Bye sweety, we could of been great 
                         together.

                                     JERRY
                         Please, let us go, we won't tell 
                         anybody.

                                     MOTHER
                         Aw, honey you know I can't do that.

                                     BABY
                         We won't tell anybody.

               Otis cocks the pistol. Jerry starts to slowly move towards 
               the coffin.

                                     OTIS
                         Christ, ain't this fucking a hoot... 
                         alright mamma, I ain't got all fucking 
                         night.

                                     JERRY
                         Please, please this is insane. You 
                         can't do this.

               Rufus pushes Jerry into the coffin.

                                     OTIS
                         It is and I can... next.

               Denise starts kicking and fighting with Rufus. Rufus tries 
               to hold her steady, when suddenly Mary breaks free and starts 
               to run.

                                     OTIS
                              (laughs and raises 
                              his pistol)
                         Where's she think she's a gonna get 
                         to? She's gonna run all the way home.

                                     BABY
                         No! Let me get her...
                              (turns to Mother)
                         ...Ma, Otis is having all the fun... 
                         can I get her?

                                     MOTHER
                         That's true, Otis... not that we're 
                         having a bad time, but...

                                     OTIS
                              (rolls his eyes)
                         Well, go get her.

               Baby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field 
               after Mary.

               Mary trips and falls over a small gravestone. She gets up 
               and stumbles back into a wooden cross. She tears the gag 
               from her mouth and gasps for air.

                                     BABY (O.S.)
                         There once was a woman who lived 
                         with her daughter in a cabbage garden.

               Mary turns toward the voice but sees nothing but wooden 
               crosses. She is in a homemade cemetery.

                                     BABY (O.S.)
                         ...along came a rabbit and ate up 
                         all the cabbages. The woman said...

               Mary turns 360 degrees, but finds nothing.

                                     BABY (O.S.)
                         ..."Go into the garden and drive out 
                         the rabbit"...

               THUD! Mary is hit from behind, she falls forward. Baby JUMPS 
               on top of her and sits on her back. Baby is holding a large 
               hunting knife.

                                     BABY
                         "Shoo! Shoo!" said the maiden...

               Mary screams in pain, as Baby PLUNGES the knife into her. 
               Baby STABS Mary again and again and again. Mary lets out a 
               long gurgling scream, then goes silent.

                                     BABY
                         ..."Come maiden," said the rabbit...
                              (leans down)
                         ...sit on my tail and go with me to 
                         my rabbit hutch.

               Baby, covered in blood, licks the knife clean.

               EXT. PIT - NIGHT

               Otis shoves Denise into the coffin with Jerry and locks the 
               lid shut. Through a CROSS-SHAPED OPENING in the coffin we 
               see them crushed together.

               Rufus LOWERS the coffin into the pit. Once the coffin is 
               inside Otis slams the door shut.

               Otis opens a small window in the door and lowers in a lantern 
               and a small tape recorder playing music.

               INT. PIT - NIGHT

               Enter Hell. The dim light of the lantern shines off the slimy 
               wet filth of the rotted wood walls. The stench of death and 
               decay hangs heavy in the thin air.

               Denise and Jerry, cold and shivering, hang half submerged in 
               thick maggot infested sludge. Bits of animal and human 
               skeletons float in the muck, broken bones lay in piles along 
               the walls.

               INT. COFFIN - NIGHT

               Through the dim light, we see the tightly packed forms of 
               Jerry and Denise.

                                     DENISE
                              (hysterical)
                         We've got get out of here, we got 
                         get out of here.

                                     JERRY
                         Think, think. Try to open the lid, 
                         try to kick a hole in the wood.

                                     DENISE
                              (crying)
                         I can't... I can't move my arms. I 
                         hurt so much.

                                     JERRY
                         I know, but we can make it out of 
                         here. We can do it.

               Boom! A LOUD THUMP is heard against the side of the coffin.

                                     JERRY
                         That was good babe, just keep doing 
                         that.

               BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

                                     DENISE
                         That's not me. I didn't... I'm not 
                         doing that.

                                     JERRY
                         Someone is out there...
                              (shouting)
                         ...help, we're in here!

                                     DENISE
                         Help, help us.

               Suddenly, an arm breaks through the side of the coffin. 
               Another smashes through the top of the lid. The coffin begins 
               to violently shake. Denise screams.

               Another reaches through, grabbing her feet. SMASH! The coffin 
               is ripped apart and Jerry is pulled away from the destruction.

               He lets out a quick scream before disappearing into the 
               darkness.

                                     DENISE
                         Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

               INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

               The spastic light of TV static strobes across the sleeping 
               face of Grampa. Beside him, Mother sleeps peacefully.

               EXT. BARN - NIGHT

               The rain has stopped. Tiny opens the doors to the barn.

               He goes inside. He exits a few moments later, dragging a 
               huge wooden stake. He sets the stake down carefully and closes 
               the barn doors. He then picks up the stake and drags it away.

               EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

               Behind the farmhouse is a camouflage jungle, an intricate 
               system of ropes and netting is strung together to hide the 
               many automobiles beneath.

               Rufus moves through the jungle. He stops and begins to remove 
               the netting from a car, it is Wydell's police cruiser. He 
               climbs inside the car, puts on Wydell's policeman's hat and 
               starts the engine. He drives off.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               Rufus is driving like a maniac through the open farmland. He 
               turns on the overhead flashing lights.

               EXT. FIELDS - NIGHT

               The police cruiser twists and turns in the barren fields.

               INT. PIT - NIGHT

               Denise stands knee deep in the sludge. Broken bits of the 
               coffin's remains are scattered around her.

                                     DENISE
                         Jerry please answer me.

               A soft moaning sound is heard coming from the other end of 
               the pit.

                                     DENISE
                         Jerry...
                              (moving slowly forward)
                         ...is that you?

               Denise cautiously makes her way to the bend at the end of 
               the tunnel. As she approaches, the moaning sound gets louder. 
               She turns the corner to see:

               TWO PALE FIGURES in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a 
               shadowy object. Denise gasps. They turn towards Denise, 
               revealing the partially devoured dead body of Jerry.

               The two bone-white ghouls are dripping with Jerry's blood, 
               they stare at Denise, then return to their prey.

               Denise screams in horror and runs, turning down another twist 
               in the underground maze. She turns the corner and runs 
               straight into SEVERAL SLOW MOVING GHOULS. The ghouls are of 
               the same deathly white complexion, hair-less with flaked, 
               cracking skin. Their yellow eyes shine in the darkness.

               They reach for her, but she breaks free and continues to run 
               into the endless stretch of tunnels before her.

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               Primitive wooden crosses form a circle around a burnt piece 
               of land, approximately twenty feet in diameter.

               Laying flat in the center is the large stake, Mary's body is 
               draped across it. Tiny is securing her to the stake with 
               rope.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               Through the windshield, we see Baby jumping and dancing in 
               the fields with several large dogs. She is firing a gun as 
               she dances.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               Baby sees the car and raises her gun. She aims it at the car 
               driver. She waits, as the car gets closer she sees the face 
               of Rufus behind the wheel. She lowers the gun and begins to 
               laugh.

               The car stops and Baby climbs into the passenger's seat. The 
               car drives off.

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               Tiny lifts the stake with Mary firmly strapped in place. He 
               implants it into the ground. Her body hangs like a doll. 
               Tiny opens a gasoline can and begins splashing gas onto the 
               stake.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               Otis, face painted like a SKULL and wearing a priest's robe, 
               walks solemnly through the tall grass.

               INT. PIT - NIGHT

               Denise, waist high in sludge, wanders lost through the endless 
               tunnels of the pit. In the distance she hears high pitched 
               animal sounds.

               A GHOUL rises up from the sludge behind Denise. It stands 
               silent. It reaches out a BONEY HAND with long curled 
               fingernails and grabs her hair. Denise screams and tries to 
               pull away. The ghoul grabs her with his other hand and pulls 
               her closer, CLAWING at her face.

               Denise fights her way free, but loses her footing and falls 
               backwards, slipping under the sludge. She quickly resurfaces 
               and starts to run.

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               Otis stands in front of the bound Mary, holding a pumpkin. 
               Otis places the pumpkin over Mary's head.

               Tiny stands behind him holding a lit torch.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               The police car drives wildly through the fields.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               Baby motions to Rufus to steer the car towards the fire.

               INT. PIT - NIGHT

               A beaten Denise struggles down a long tunnel. She gets to 
               the end to find that it is a dead-end. Behind her, FIVE GHOULS 
               move silently towards her, blocking her only exit.

               The ghouls slosh through the muck, moving in closer. Denise 
               frantically looks for an escape, nailed into the wall next 
               to her are planks of wood forming a ladder.

               The ghouls are only a few yards away. Denise climbs up the 
               ladder. They move in, clawing at her legs and feet, trying 
               to pull her down. Denise digs at the wood and mud ceiling 
               above her, trying to break free.

               Denise is bleeding severely from the chunks of flesh being 
               torn from her legs. She digs wildly at the ceiling, suddenly 
               a board falls free and mud rains down to reveal:

               STARS, the sky above shines through the hole. Denise smashes 
               her fists at the rotted wood planks, pulling free another 
               piece.

               With all her might Denise grabs hold and pulls herself up 
               through the opening.

               EXT. PIT - NIGHT

               Denise fights her way through the earth and pulls her body 
               up into the night air. The cool air rushes to her lungs. She 
               crawls free of the hole, gasping for air.

               She is safe. Suddenly... SMASH! A ghoul has broken through 
               the surface. He grabs Denise by the leg and begins to pull 
               her back into the hole.

               Denise screams and begins kicking violently at the ghoul. 
               She breaks and crawls from the ghoul's reach.

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               Rufus and Baby have pulled the police cruiser up by the stake. 
               Rufus and Baby stand on the hood.

               Otis finishes his sermon, he raises his arm. Tiny raises the 
               torch. Otis drops his arm, signaling Tiny. Tiny throws the 
               torch onto the stake. The stake ignites into a huge FIREBALL.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               Denise pulls herself to her feet and begins to run.

               The flaming object burns in the distance behind her.

               Denise stumbles toward the road on two badly injured legs.

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               Rufus, Tiny and Baby jump up and down in celebration, smashing 
               the police car. Otis stands transfixed by the flames before 
               him.

               EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

               Denise makes her way out onto the road. No cars are in sight. 
               In the distance headlights break through the darkness. Denise 
               stands in the middle of the road.

               The TRUCK comes into view, it is a small cube truck.

               Denise stands in the headlights, waving her arms for it to 
               stop. The truck comes to a halt.

               She runs toward the passenger's side door and climbs in.

               INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

               Behind the wheel of the truck is Captain Spaulding.

               Denise is shaking from shock.

                                     DENISE
                         Go, go! Drive... drive!

                                     CAPT. SPAULDING
                         Hold on, girly, what's the problem?

                                     DENISE
                              (becoming hysterical)
                         Murdering... blood and Jerry...
                              (starts to cry 
                              uncontrollably)
                         ...monsters... I... I... I got away...

                                     CAPT. SPAULDING
                         Well, I don't see what the fuck you're 
                         getting at, but I got some friends 
                         that live just up this road.

               Starts to turn the truck up the road back towards the 
               farmhouse.

                                     DENISE
                              (screaming)
                         No! No, that's it... that house is...
                              (tries to open the 
                              truck door)
                         ...I gotta get out, I gotta get out!

               Boom! The metal door leading to the back of the truck slides 
               open. Ravelli grabs Denise and pulls her back into the back 
               of the truck.

               SLAM! The metal door shuts.

               EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

               The truck quietly turns onto the dirt road leading up to the 
               farmhouse. The jack-o'-lanterns still burn in the windows, 
               grinning their evil grin.

                                         THE END
I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 

          JENNIFER HILLS races down from a stoop, a suitcase rolling
          along behind her. Even dressed down, this city girl can't
          hide her natural beauty and panache.
          She makes her way across the street and to an SUV. she opens
          the trunk and tosses in the suitcase among several other
          bags.

          She closes it, and walks to the driver's side. We see that
          the entire cargo bay of the SUV is filled with boxes and
          personal affects.

          Al INT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Al

          Jennifer gets in and slams the door shut. she takes a moment
          to think, to breathe. Something is weighing heavily on her
          mind.

          After a beat, she glances up to the rearview mirror and looks
          at herself. She take a long, deep, cleansing breath, and
          then she turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.
          B1 EXT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Bl
          The SUV drives off down the city street.

          C1 EXT. CITY OVERPASS - DAY C1 

          The SUV carves its way through traffic as the city looms in
          the background, growing more distant by the second.

          2 INT. CAR, RURAL ROAD - DAY 2 

          The midday sun bakes the landscape as Jennifer drives through
          a country road. A stark contrast from the city, and
          absolutely breathtaking.

                         GPS SYSTEM
          Turn right up ahead.


          Jennifer squints out the front windshield. The streets are
          all unpaved and none of them are marked with street signs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 2.

          Finally, Jennifer pulls into the driveway of a small house.
          She picks up a piece of paper from the passenger seat, checks
          the address on the house, and gets out of the car.

          3 EXT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 3

          Jennifer walks up the crumbling steps of the house. On the
          screen door, a wire holds a wooden sign that reads; OPEN.
          The screen door SQUEAKS loudly as Jennifer pulls it open.

                         JENNIFER
          Hello?

          Jennifer cautiously steps inside.

          4 INT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 4

          The sunlight shines through the dirty curtains. Dust clouds
          hang motionless in the air, as if suspended in a solution.
          Scattered across the floor are a variety of electronics in
          various stages of disrepair. A handful of old, picture tube
          TVs with their plastic casings cracked.

                         JENNIFER
          Hello?

          Jennifer walks in further, trying to not step on anything.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Hello?

          EARL (O.S.)
          I'm a coming, I'm a coming.

          From out of the back walks the proprietor, EARL (late-50's),
          takes a double take at Jennifer, surely the prettiest thing
          he's seen in a long while. He sees her standing in the
          middle of the mess, suddenly aware of it. He bends down to
          pick something up in a futile attempt to clean.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          Sorry about the mess.

                         JENNIFER
          It's fine, really. I'm Jennifer
          Hills. We spoke last week.

                         (NO RECOGNITION)
          I'm the one who's renting the cabin
          on...

                         (MORE)

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          (Jennifer holds a piece of paper)
          .on Mockingbird Trail.

          Earl's surprised.

                         EARL
          Oh, you're Miss Hills.

          Earl walks over to a cabinet against the wall, opens a small
          drawer and takes out a key.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          Don't suppose you know how to get
          out there?

                         JENNIFER
          Afraid not.

          Earl hands her the key. Earl pulls a map with some hand-drawn
          arrows already on it.

                         EARL
          Alright, listen up 'cause it's a bit
          tricky.

                         (BEAT)
          These here arrows will get you
          through town. Over here, it's more
          dirt road and woods so it can get
          kind of dicey. We're a tad short
          on street signs.

                         JENNIFER
          Well if I get lost I'll just ask
          for directions.

                         EARL
          To who? Lady, the cabin is a real
          beaut, but heck if there ain't
          nothin' out there for a good
          country mile.

                         JENNIFER

                         (JOKING)
          Well, I guess I don't have to worry
          about bothering the neighbors.

                         EARL
          Not planning on throwing a party,
          are ya? The security deposit...

                         JENNIFER
          No, no. I'm looking forward to the
          peace and quiet. I'm a novelist.
          I'm starting my next book.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 4.
          Earl just looks at her.

                         EARL
          Alright, well, if that's what
          you're aimin' for, just follow that
          there map.

          Jennifer looks at the map.

          5 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY 5

          Jennifer drives down the two lane road, barely passable by
          two cars. She swerves as she glances down at map.
          Then, up ahead she spots a small SERVICE STATION with a
          single gas pump. She pulls up to the pump.

          EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY 6 

          Jennifer gets out of the car and fumbles to fold back the map
          as she twists the knob off her gas tank and reaches for the
          pump. A HAND comes down on top of her own.

          Jennifer spins around. 

          Standing there, smiling, is JOHNNY. He takes the pump from
          Jennifer and inserts it into her gas tank.

                         JOHNNY
          Didn't mean to frighten you.

          Johnny is good-looking in a rugged sort of way. He's sinewy,
          but athletic and strong. Jennifer regains her composure.

                         JENNIFER
          No, it's fine. I'm sort of lost
          anyway. Looking for Mockingbird
          Trail?

                         JOHNNY
          You are definitely lost. 

                         JENNIFER
          Really? I thought--

                         JOHNNY
          Nah, you sure missed it. It's a 
          good ten miles back, left turn 
          after the big red mailbox.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 4A.

                         JENNIFER
          Oh, okay, I think I saw that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 5.
          Johnny flashes his smile, picking his teeth with a toothpick.
          Jennifer stands there uncomfortably.

                         JOHNNY
          You, uh... staying at the cabin?

          Jennifer hesitates for a second. Just as Jennifer opens her
          mouth to respond, the shrill notes of a HARMONICA shatter the
          silence. Jennifer turns quickly to the garage.

          In the garage, ANDY, one of Johnny's employees, sits on the
          fender of a broken down car. He holds a harmonica to his
          lips. He's in his mid-30's with shaggy hair and arms that
          look like they could bend steel.

          STANLEY, one of Johnny and Andy's buddies, walks up behind
          Andy. He's balding and overweight, and digs into a bag of
          pork rinds.

                         STANLEY 
          Howdy ma'am. 

          He leans into Andy who continues playing his harp. 

                         ANDY
          I'd sop that up with a biscuit real
          good.

          Jennifer turns away from the garage and looks back at Johnny,
          who is still awaiting her answer.

                         JENNIFER
          Uh... no. I mean yes.

          As she glances to the gas pump, Johnny looks her up and down.
          She is definitely something to look at.

          Johnny places his hand on the hood of the car. Glances to
          the guys, then back to her.

                         JOHNNY
          You know, you're running a little
          hot. Want me to uh... maybe I
          should check under your hood?

          Jennifer almost laughs at the way that sounded.

                         JENNIFER
          How's that line working for you?

          The gas pump clicks off interrupting. But Johnny just stands
          there looking at her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 5A.

                         JOHNNY
          I don't know, how's it working for
          you?

          Johnny saunters over to the pump and in a phallic manner,
          pulls the pump out. It gets laughs from the peanut gallery.
          Jennifer looks away, a line has been crossed. She looks to
          the pump again. $19.78.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 6.

                         JENNIFER
          Let me just...

          Jennifer fumbles into her purse when the map falls from her
          hands.

                         JOHNNY
          I'll get that.

                         JENNIFER
          No I got it--

          Johnny gets uncomfortably close to Jennifer at the rear door
          of the car when--
          HONK -- HONK -- HONK - The SUV's deafening alarm blares out.
          Johnny's startled, stumbles backwards, trips and goes
          sprawling to the ground.

          Jennifer, controlling laughter, holds up her keys and clicks
          the alarm off.

          Johnny is covered in dust and oil, struggling to get to his
          feet while maintaining a shred of dignity. Jennifer
          chuckles.


                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Sorry. I accidentally hit the
          panic button. Are you okay?

                         JOHNNY
          I'm fine.

          Johnny looks away, angry. He's certainly not the type of guy
          who can laugh at himself easily, if at all. From the garage,
          Stanley and Andy point at him and guffaw.

                         ANDY
          (from the garage)
          Hey! You better check your
          underwear, Johnny.

          Stanley smiles and elbows Andy, but his mouth is too full
          with pork rinds to actually laugh.

                         STANLEY
          Yea... Check um' for skidmarks...
          Johnny shoots him a harsh look. 

          Jennifer hands Johnny a twenty. Trying to contain her
          laughter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 6A.

                         JENNIFER
          Sure you okay?

          Johnny's eyes are cold, his face red.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 7.

                         JOHNNY
          I said I was fine.

          Suddenly, Jennifer grows uneasy. She smiles uncomfortably,
          gets in the car and drives away.

          Johnny takes a bandana from his pocket and wipes his brow.
          He watches Jennifer's car disappear and spits on the ground
          as the laughter escalates in her absence. Johnny spins.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          What the hell are you two dipshits
          laughing at?!

          7 EXT. CABIN - DAY 7

          Jennifer arrives at the cabin. She gets out of her car and
          stands there, looking up at it. In slight disrepair and in
          need of a paint job but the quaint charm makes you quickly
          forget its shortcomings.

          8 TNT. CABIN - DAY 8 

           Jennifer walks in with her bags, looks around the cabin.
           It's rustic, but she's hardly roughing it.

          9 INT. CABIN, THE KITCHEN - DAY 9 

           She starts unpacking. A few cardboard boxes with non-
          perishable food items sit on the counter next to cases of
          bottled water. Also, there's a large wine case with
          different liquor bottles in the sections. Jennifer takes out
          a bottle of top shelf vodka and puts it in the freezer.
          Then she begins to grab the wine bottles, taking an extra
          second to look at one, the hell with it, she grabs an opener.

          A9 TNT. CABIN - DAY A9 
          Jennifer sets up her laptop at a make-shift workstation.
          Throws some freshly cut flowers in a small vase, a few lucky
          figurines from her travels... it all feels very ritualistic.

          10 EXT. CABIN - DAY 10 

          Jennifer site at the end of the boat dock. Laptop and glass
          of wine writing away. She couldn't be more content.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 8.
          She takes a deep, replenishing breath, and then goes back to

                         WRITING--

          A10 INT. CABIN - DAY A10

          CLOSE ON: Words fly across the screen as Jennifer types at a
          furious pace. Blocks of text keep scrolling away.
          Her fingers effortlessly swipe away at key after key, a
          writer's high if you will.
          Finally an exclamation point is stabbed with emphasis. Then 
          she hears a sound off in the trees. 
          She looks out and hears a very distant few notes of a 
          harmonica. Then a few even more distant "heeeeeeweeeee". 
          After a beat she innocently smiles figuring it's just some 
          boys off in the distance having a party or something. 
          Jennifer leans back, smiles briefly and pour herself a glass
          of wine.

          11 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH - DUSK 11 

          Jennifer sits at the table, her laptop propped open in front
          of her. She's talking away on the phone as she stops for a
          moment to take a sip from a glass of red wine.

                         JENNIFER

                         (INTO PHONE)
          .Lonely? Are you kidding? I
          should've come out here on my first
          book...
          The wind kicks up and a in the distance a door is slammed
          shut. It startles jennifer. She looks in the direction of the
          sound.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Sorry, something just...
          Another slam, and again.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Barb, hold on a minute...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 8A.
          Jennifer sets down her lap top and puts the glass of wine on
          the arm of the chair. She gets up and looks off into the
          dusky woods. Then back to the house.
          A light breeze kicks up and SLAM. Again.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Let me call you back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 9.
          Jennifer snaps the phone shut, and walks down the steps of
          the front porch.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Hello?
          In response, she gets the frantic CHIRPING of crickets as
          night encroaches.
          Jennifer walks down a path and in the near distance she see a

          SHED. SLAM!
          The SHED DOOR is kicking open and closed in the breeze.
          She makes her way towards the shed.
          All EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK All
          Jennifer gets to the shed. The door is wide open. She steps
          inside.

          B11 INT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK B11

          Inside there is an array of old gardening tools. Pots,
          garbage cans. Some different chemical bottles including a jug
          of LYE.
          Jennifer thinks she hears something from deep inside the
          shed. She moves in further as--

          SLAM!
          The door shuts behind her -

                         JENNIFER
          Shit!

          C11 EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK C11

          Jennifer exits, and securely closes the shed door. After a
          beat she smirks at the thought that she thought this was more
          than just a door blowing in the wind, then heads back to the
          cabin.

          D12 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH -DUSK D12 

          Jennifer walks up to the chair, moves her laptop, sits and
          then as she grabs her phone she knocks the glass of wine off
          the arm of the chair into her lap.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 10.

                         JENNIFER
          Ohhhhh... You gotta be kidding.
          She get up, looks at the red wine stain all over her lap, and
          picks up her things to heads in the cabin.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Way to go Jennifer...
          The last of the days light is disappearing.

          12 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 12

          Jennifer stands at the sink, in panties and tank top - pre-
          soaking her sweater and pants.

          13 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 13 


          POV THROUGH KITCHEN WINDOW:
          Jennifer continues at the sink, her beautiful, partially nude
          body is framed perfectly in the window for all to see... but
          no one's around for miles...

          14 EXT. WOODS - DAY 14 

          Jennifer jogs through the trees. She wears a tight pair of
          running shorts and a out off T-shirt.
          Jennifer stops in a small clearing. With her hands on her
          knees, she struggles to catch her breath.
          She stands and walks in a circle, looks around. Checks her
          watch.
          Then notices something in the distance hidden behind the
          trees.
          ANGLE ON: A dilapidated shack, rotted from decay and neglect.
          Jennifer's curiosity gets the best of her.

          15 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 15 

          She walks up to the shack, looks around. She then enters
          through what is left of the front door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 11.

          A15 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY A15

          The place hasn't been occupied in quite a while, but it was
          once. An old, dirty mattress in the corner... a sawhorse-for-
          a-counter with old cans and bottles... even a rusty old
          garden tool or two.
          Near the window she sees an old, mold covered BIBLE propped
          open.
          Jennifer suddenly gets the chills, she shakes it off and then
          gets the hell out of there.

          16 EXT. CABIN - DAY 16

           Jennifer finishes her jog and returns to the cabin, leans 
           over on the porch and catches her breath. 

          17 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY 17 

          Jennifer stands in front of the mirror. She looks at her
          reflection and pulls out the band that was holding up her
          ponytail. Her sweat-soaked hair falls across her shoulders.
          She turns on the faucet and is met with a dirty spray.

                         JENNIFER
          Eww!
          The spray only lasts a few seconds before sputtering out.
          However, then the toilet starts to GURGLE. Jennifer lifts
          the lid up with her foot. The toilet water bubbles up and
          then disappears down the drain.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         (SHUDDERS)
          Gross.
          Again, Jennifer tries the sink, but now nothing comes out.

          18 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 18

          Jennifer picks up her cellphone from the counter. She takes
          a small piece of paper out of her purse and punches in some
          numbers on the cell. After a few rings, voicemail picks up.

          about buying or selling an exotic
          animal, please leave your name --
          Jennifer snaps the phone shut in frustration, when her eye
          catches the water-damaged remnants of a service sticker
          hanging to the refrigerator door.
          Amazingly, the phone number is still visible. She shrugs to
          herself and dials the number.

          19 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM -- DAY 19

          She lifts the lid and looks inside - dry - and flushes a few
          more times to no avail - then dirty water begins to gurgle
          up.

                         JENNIFER

                         (LISTENS INTENTLY)
          No, it won't flush... I did that
          already... yes... look, I'm really
          in a spot... okay... thank you...
          I'm not going anywhere.
          As Jennifer snaps her phone shut, the handset gets caught on
          her chin, and tumbles into the toilet. PLOP!

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Oh shit!
          Jennifer reaches down into the toilet and immediately fishes
          it out. She shakes it off vigorously.

          20 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 20 

          Jennifer stands next to the kitchen counter. She holds her
          hair dryer which is going at full blast. Her cell phone is
          propped open on the counter in front of her. She's doing her
          best to dry it out.
          Suddenly, a hand reaches out and taps her on the shoulder.
          Jennifer SCREAMS and spins around, turning the hair dryer on
          her assailant.
          An equally frightened MATTHEW throws his hands up in front of
          his face and SCREAMS just as loudly. He has several think
          colored rubber bands on his wrist.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 12A.

                         MATTHEW
          P1... please! I... I came to fix
          the plumbing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 13.
          Jennifer turns off the hair dryer.

                         MATTHEW (CONT'D)
          I... I was knocking on the d...door
          a...a... while.
          Jennifer breathes a sigh of relief, especially after she gets
          a look at Matthew. He's in his mid-30's, but could pass for
          a good ten years younger. Awkward and shy, he can barely
          make eye contact with her.

                         JENNIFER

                         (FRIENDLY)
          I think you may have taken a few 
          years off my life. 
          Matthew doesn't get the joke.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Uh... thanks for coming on such
          short notice.

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          You need to see the bathroom,
          right?

          21 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY 21

          Matthew works away underneath the sink. Jennifer watches him
          from the bedroom sitting on the end of the bed, trying to
          make small talk.

                         JENNIFER
          Is this gonna take much longer?

                         MATTHEW
          (muffled, under the sink)
          N...not much.

                         JENNIFER
          So what's wrong with it?

                         MATTHEW
          Uh... it's just older pipes.
          Matthew continues his work, you can tell he is uncomfortable
          with the conversation.

                         JENNIFER
          So do you live around here?

                         MATTHEW
          No...no one lives around here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 14.

                         JENNIFER
          Yeah, I kind of get that. I meant
          in town?
          Matthew comes out from under the sink. He snaps nerviously
          at one of the rubber bands on his wrist.

                         MATTHEW
          My... my whole life...
          Jennifer looks to his wrist. It's all red.
          Matthew turns on the faucet. Out comes a hard stream of
          cold, clear water. He flushes the toilet and then turns on
          the shower to the same result.

                         MATTHEW (CONT'D)
          All fixed.
          Jennifer squeals with excitement. She wraps her arms around
          Matthew and plants a kiss on his cheek.

                         JENNIFER
          Thank you!
          Matthew blushes furiously and fumbles his tools as he packs
          up. For him, the kiss was more embarrassing than enjoyable.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I just... you saved me
          from having to bathe in the pond. 
          Once his tools are all packed away, Matthew dashes out of the
          cabin. Jennifer follows him to the front door.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Hey. Hey! I didn't even pay you!
          But Matthew is long gone.

          22 EXT. FISHING HOLE - DAY 22


          ON MINIDV CAN LCD
          A wooden bat crashes down on a fish. It goes still.
          Stanley takes a MINIDV CAMCORDER away from his eye. He looks
          at Andy who's holding the bloody bat, and takes a large gulp
          from his beer, then--

                         STANLEY
          Ground rule double.

                         ANDY

                         (ANGRILY)
          A double! Look at its head. I
          knocked the eye clear out.
          Andy has, in fact, knocked the fish's eye clear out. It lays
          next to the creature, all weird and googly-looking.

                         STANLEY
          Fine. Maybe a triple. But that's
          it. You got to knock the guts out
          its mouth to score a run.

                         ANDY
          Would you turn that thing off?
          Gonna get us in trouble with that
          human society.

                         JOHNNY
          Humane you dipshit.
          Johnny site in a chair holding his fishing rod between his
          knees. A cigarette dangles from his mouth and a beer is
          perpetually glued to his hand.

                         ANDY
          Whatever.

                         STANLEY
          I told you. This thing is going to
          make me a fortune. All you got to
          do is film something crazy, then
          you send it into the internet, make
          a killing.

                         ANDY
          No one's gonna pay you for that
          crap.

                         STANLEY
          It's the hits, Andy. You just
          gotta get the hits.

                         JOHNNY
          Hits my ass, now you two retards
          gonna fish or what?
          Matthew comes crashing out of the foliage, knocks over the
          cooler spilling ice and beer all over.

                         ANDY
          Speaking of retards.

                         MATTHEW
          Q..Quit it Andy.

                         JOHNNY
          Alright. Now we're all here,
          what's the big show, Stanley?

                         STANELY
          The big show is this--
          Stanley holds up the video camera like a trophy.

                         ANDY
          Are you kidding me? That shit?
          What'd you do? Film yourself
          lighting a fart?

                         STANELY
          Better.
          Johnny just shakes his head.

                         JOHNNY

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          I don't know why I bother.

                         STANLEY
          I got Matthew's girlfriend in a
          private moment. 

                         ANDY
          What do you mean like on the toilet 
          or something? 
          Stanley pulls a tape out of his pocket and loads it.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          Matthew hasn't had a girl since he
          was sucking his mama's titties.

                         STANLEY
          Not true, my friends. And the
          evidence is right here.

                         MATTHEW
          What are you ta... talking 'bout
          Stanley?

                         ANDY
          Yeah, what are you talking about?

                         STANLEY
          He had that babe from the city all
          alone and he didn't even try to
          nail her.

          This gets Johnny's attention. Matthew is snapping on of the
          rubber bands. It's a bit loud. Johnny looks to him as if it
          is annoying him.

                         JOHNNY
          What babe from the city?

                         STANLEY
          You know, the one who stopped for
          gas the other day. The one who
          dumped you on your can. She had
          Matty here fixing her pipes.

                         JOHNNY
          Bullshit.
          Matthew snaps the rubber band more. Johnny turns quickly to
          him.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Cut that shit homo! How many times
          I gotta tell you.
          Stanley gets the camera ready.

                         STANLEY
          She even gave him a kiss for
          "servicing her." Look, here's
          Matthew running from the cabin like
          a schoolgirl.
          They all gather around.
          POV CAMERA: Matthew runs from the cabin, dropping tools as
          he goes. Jennifer stands in the doorway calling after him.
          The camera goes closer on Jennifer --
          The guys break up. Johnny is a bit more serious.

                         ANDY
          Now that's some fine camera work,
          even better than the time you
          filmed yo' self hangin' your nana's
          cat.

                         JOHNNY
          What's this about a kiss? 

                         STANLEY
          Matthew here says she gave him a
          kiss right on the cheek.

                         JOHNNY
          Bullshit.

                         MATTHEW
          No, she did Johnny. She kissed me.

                         JOHNNY
          Don't lie to me dipshit.

                         STANELY
          If you all don't shut the hell up
          you'll miss the encore.
          All eyes turn to Stanley as Stanley pushes some buttons on
          the MINIDV cam. Andy comes over and looks at the LCD screen.

                         STANLEY
          Get ready for it.
          ON MINIDV: The footage that Stanley shot is obviously the
          previous night through Jennifer's kitchen window.

                         ANDY
          I'll be. Look at the rack on that
          pony.
          Andy punches Stanley in the arm. Johnny just stares at the
          screen.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          You dirty dog. Where the hell'd
          you get that?

                         STANLEY
          I've been working nights.

                         ANDY
          Sure is something to look at.
          Matthew is clearly uncomfortable, but he desperately needs to
          be one of the guys.

                         MATTHEW
          Yeah, and she likes me... she was
          nice to me.
          Stretching a rubber band.

                         ANDY
          Nice? To her, you're nothing but a
          shitter fixer. Hell, she wouldn't
          even give Johnny the time of day.
          Johnny snaps his head up and looks at Stanley.

                         JOHNNY
          Bullshit. I could tame that ass if
          I wanted to.

                         ANDY
          You saw her Johnny... stuck up city
          bitch.

          Yea, girls like that think you're
          hardly good enough to pump their
          gas.
          Johnny lights up another cigarette. He points at Andy. 

                          

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 19.

                         JOHNNY
          Let me tell you something. I had
          her creaming in her panties.

                         ANDY
          And she had you shitting yours.
          Least her car alarm did.
          The guys yuck it up.

                         JOHNNY

                         (SEETHING)
          You don't think I could have her
          anytime I want?
          Andy looks away and begins to reel in his line. Stanley
          stuffs his face with some crap so he doesn't have to answer.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Bitch like that comes up here for
          one reason. Sitting in that
          window, tits flapping in the wind
          for all to see. You know?

                         MATTHEW
          Nah... She's not like that, Johnny.
          Johnny snorts, condescendingly.

                         JOHNNY
          How do you know, ya fuckin' virgin?
          Let me tell you something. They're
          all like that! Fucking big city
          cock-teasing whore is all she is.
          He flicks his cigarette and it sizzles out in the water. Then
          he gets right up in Matthew's face.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          You'd have no idea what to do with
          a piece of ass like that. But
          luckily I'm your friend.
          Johnny hands him a beer and pats him on the back firmly.

          23 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 23

          Jennifer writes away at the dining room table. She's on a
          tear. A "writer's zone" where everything she types is gold.
          She hits the "return" key hard, as if to punctuate a
          particularly good sentence. She picks up some lip gloss and
          puts it on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 20.
          She leans back to take a break when her eye catches the cell
          phone sitting on the table. She picks the phone up, flips it
          open - It's still completely dead.
          In frustration, she throws the phone across the room. It
          hits the couch right next to the duffle bag. She smiles
          mischievously to herself.
          Jennifer reaches inside and withdraws a sandwich bag filled
          with pot and rolling papers. She expertly rolls herself a
          joint and lights it up. She closes her eyes. Bliss.

          24 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT -- LATER 24

          From a distance, the cabin looks like a star twinkling in the
          night sky. Trees sway in the breeze, dappling the light.

          25 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 25

          Jennifer's head is slouched over her desk. She passed out.
          Suddenly, A SCRATCHING NOISE at the front door.
          CLOSE ON: Jennifer's eyes flit open as -
          Jennifer jumps awake and walks over to check the door,
          glancing at the clock as she goes. 4:14 am.
          Jennifer gets to the door and listens, Nothing. She tries
          to look out... nothing.
          She turns to walk back when the scratching returns -
          Jennifer takes a few steps back toward the door. Again, the
          noise stops.

                         JENNIFER
          Hello?
          Silence. Jennifer rises up on her toes and looks out the
          glass window of the front door. The porch is deserted.
          Jennifer opens the door slowly.

          26 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 26

          Jennifer looks outside but nothing is there. Just a gentle
          breeze and the sway of the trees. Satisfied, she walks out
          onto the front porch, then down the steps. She hugs herself
          and shivers, then she returns inside.

          27 INT. CABIN, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 27

          Jennifer shuts the front door and locks it. Then she yanks
          on the door, just to make sure.

          28 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 28

          She walks back in grabbing her glass and bottle when --

          29 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 29

          The SCRAPING sound again, but this time, from UPSTAIRS.
          Jennifer looks up, hoping that she imagined it. But there it
          is again. She sets the bottle and glass down on the end table
          next to the couch and then grabs a can of MACE from her purse
          on the couch.

          30 INT. CABIN, STAIRCASE - NIGHT 30 

          She walks slowly, holding the mace directly in front of her.
          Eventually, Jennifer gets to the top of the stairs.
          At the far end of the hallway is an open window. A branch
          from outside scrapes against the windowsill.
          Jennifer lets out a sigh of relief. She closes the window
          and heads back downstairs.

          31 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - NIGHT 31 

          She puts the mace back in her purse, and then picks up her
          drink walking to the kitchen when--
          BANG! Something smashes into the sliding glass door--
          Jennifer SCREAMS dropping the glass. It SHATTERS.
          With more than a hint of trepidation, Jennifer heads towards

          THE SIDE DOOR.
          With all the courage she can muster up, Jennifer unlocks the
          door and steps outside.

          32 EXT. CABIN, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 32

          The side porch light acts as a spotlight, illuminating the
          culprit -- a lone bird lies motionless on the ground.
          Jennifer bends down and picks up a small branch from the
          porch. She gives the bird a small poke... nothing. But her
          uneasiness is growing. Suddenly... SLAM!
          She jumps and looks to the shed, the door is open again and
          swinging. She looks to it thinking, "I shut that already..."
          She moves off the porch and toward the shed.

          33 EXT. CABIN, SHED - NIGHT 33

          Jennifer walks to the shed, it feels longer in the dark. She
          looks around to the tree line, could be something out there,
          an animal, who knows.
          She reaches the shed and shuts the door again. She searches
          the ground and sees a large stone.
          She picks up the stone and shoves it against the door.
          Satisfied, she heads back.

          34 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 34

          Jennifer immediately goes over to her table where the laptop
          is set up. She shuffles some papers around when-
          Something on her laptop screen catches her attention. She
          leans forward, brow furrowed.
          ON LAPTOP SCREEN: A picture of Johnny, Stanley, and Andy
          leering into the laptop's camera. Like a nightmarish photo
          booth snapshot.

                         JOHNNY
          Nice shot huh?
          Jennifer shrieks and spins around only to find --
          Standing there, right inside the front door, is Johnny. He
          smiles.
          Johnny shrugs calmly and continues milling about the room.
          Jennifer spins around, looking for a way out.

          But Stanley has slipped in through the back door, video
          camera obnoxiously filming the scene (which will be out to
          throughout).

                         STANLEY
          Smile real pretty for the camera.

          Now that's not very hospitable, is
          it?
          Then, the wooden stairs creak under Andy's steps as he walks
          down -- around his chest is one of Jennifer's bra stretched
          to the limit. He's twirling a thong panty on his finger. The
          guys get a good laugh at Andy.

                         JENNIFER
          All of you better get out of here.
          I called the police.
          Johnny nods. He looks at her, his gaze mocking.

                         JOHNNY
          You called the police? Or you will
          call the police?

                         JENNIFER
          I... I called them already.
          They're on their way right now!

                         JOHNNY
          With what phone? Matthew said you
          dropped it in the drink.
          Jennifer doesn't answer.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          (looks at Stanley)
          Speaking of.. .where the hell is he?
          Stanley takes a few steps toward the back door.

                         STANLEY
          Matthew, get your boney ass in
          here!
          Shortly after, Matthew shuffles inside. He can't even bring
          himself to look at Jennifer.

                         JOHNNY

                         (TO JENNIFER)
          Matthew here said you didn't pay
          him for fixity' your sink?

                         JENNIFER
          That is just not true! I tried to.
          He ran out... (to Matthew) Is that
          what you said?
          Matthew winces and starts to snap a rubber band on his wrist.
          as Jennifer walks over to her purse.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          I'll take care of it--
          Johnny cuts her off.

                         JOHNNY
          --Let's not worry about that right
          now.
          Johnny hops up on the kitchen counter, cutting her off with
          his leg. He then picks up the bottle of vodka, takes a swig.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Now what's a pretty little thing
          like you doing out here all alone?

                         JENNIFER
          I'm writing. I'm a Writer... But
          my boyfriend is coming up. He'll
          actually be here any minute--

                         JOHNNY
          That right?
          The guys give a good chuckle-

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Well, I didn't realize you had a
          boyfriend coming down. We'd better
          get on outta here. Don't want to
          ruin date night.

                         STANLEY
          Yeah, yeah. Date night.

                         ANDY

                         (CHUCKLING)
          Date night...

                         JOHNNY
          You know what I think. I think
          you're lying. There's no
          boyfriend. No man in his right
          mind would leave a girl like you
          all up here on your own.

                         (EMPHATIC)
          No he's coming. He had to work. I
          told you he'll be here soon.

          Johnny turns to her.

                         JOHNNY
          Yeah, well so will Santi Clause.
          Andy and Stanley are loving every minute of this. Matthew
          leans against the wall, his eyes on the floor.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Come here. Have a drink with me.

                         JENNIFER
          No, look. I have the money--
          Andy slingshots the thong right at Jennifer. It lands at her
          feet.

                         JOHNNY
          What's a matter? Too good to drink
          with us?

                         JENNIFER
          Please, I don't want to.
          Johnny raises his eyebrows. The bottle is partially empty.

                         JOHNNY

                         (TO JENNIFER)
          Uh, what's this? It's already been
          opened.

                         (TO OTHERS)
          See, she don't want to drink with
          us. What are we, dirt?

                         JENNIFER
          I didn't say that.
          Andy walks over and sits down at her desk, clicks around the
          screen, begins reading aloud from the text...

                         ANDY

                         (READING)
          .No one wants a phone call at 2
          o'clock in the morning. When
          you're fifteen it's a prank call,
          when your twenty it's a drunk
          boyfriend call, but after twenty
          five, it's usually real bad news.
          That's how I found out my father
          died...

                         (THEN)
          Whose daddy died?

                         JENNIFER
          Can you all please leave me alone?!
          Meanwhile, Stanley putters around the kitchen, opening and
          closing the cabinet doors, knocking stuff around. He finds a
          pack of rice cakes. He shoves one in his mouth, winces,
          spits it out.

                         STANLEY
          Damned cardboard. You eat this
          shit?

                         ANDY
          You should! Do you some good.
          Andy turns from the desk, strikes a match and flicks it at
          Jennifer,

                         JENNIFER
          Look, can you just tell me what you
          want? What do you want? I offered
          you money.
          Johnny stubbornly holds out the bottle of vodka. Andy
          giggles. He finds this quite funny.

                         JOHNNY

                         (EXTENDING BOTTLE)
          Here.

                         JENNIFER
          Fine, if you'll leave I'll take a
          drink.
          Jennifer studies the bottle and finally accepts it. Drinks a
          small sip. They all start booing.

                         JOHNNY
          Come on. You can do better than
          that. I bet when you're out there
          with your city friends you can throw
          'em back with the best of them.

                         JENNIFER
          I took the drink, now you--

                         JOHNNY
          I said drink it!
          Jennifer grows increasingly nervous and reluctantly takes a
          nice swig. Then chokes and gags. They all cheer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 27.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          See? Now was that so bad?
          Johnny takes the bottle back and takes a swig himself.

                         JENNIFER
          Look, I'm sorry if I embarrassed
          you the other day, but we're even
          now, right? Okay. Please. Leave.
          Andy and Stanley plop themselves down on the couch and prop
          their feet up on the wood and glass coffee table.

                         JOHNNY
          Oh... that's not what this is
          about.

                         JENNIFER
          Then what is this about?
          Johnny jumps down from the counter. He stands in front of
          Jennifer, towering over her.

                         JOHNNY
          I want to see your teeth.
          As if the air is sucked out of the room. Jennifer stares at
          him, not even sure she heard him correctly.
          Matthew snaps the rubber band harder. He moves to the far
          corner of the room and tucks himself against the wall.

                         JENNIFER
          Wha... what?

                         JOHNNY
          You heard me, show Horse. Show me
          your teeth.

                         JENNIFER
          That's... I'm not going to...
          please leave.

                         JOHNNY
          (quiet, but firm)
          Show the teeth...
          Andy walks over and hands Johnny the small wooden bat he used
          to kill the fish. Johnny smacks it against his palm.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          .or lose the teeth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 27A.
          Andy walks back to the couch and flicks another match at
          Jennifer. She recoils with fear as she reluctantly gives a
          half-smile, her teeth clenched together.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 28.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          No. Put two fingers in the side of
          your mouth. Then two fingers in
          the other side... and pull.
          Jennifer looks at Johnny like he's seriously disturbed as
          Johnny slaps the bat against his hand punctuating his point.
          Jennifer puts her fingers in her mouth. She pulls her lips
          away from the gums, spreading them grotesquely. It's
          completely humiliating. Jennifer stops.

                         JENNIFER
          Now please... I'm begging you...
          Johnny slides off the counter.

                         JOHNNY
          Uh, uh. Again.
          Jennifer reinserts her fingers and pulls. Johnny reaches
          into her mouth and grabs a hold of her two front teeth with
          his thumb and forefinger.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Alright. Good girl, Show Horse.
          Johnny pulls down on Jennifer's teeth, forcing her to the
          floor. Jennifer looks as if she's about to cry, near her on
          the ground is the broken glass.
          Stanley and Andy needle each other like schoolboys. Matthew
          shuffles nervously, clearly uncomfortable at being there.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          I'll tell you something
          sweetheart... know why you ain't
          got no boyfriend?... 'Cause all
          them city guys are faggots.
          Johnny turns to her.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          But uh... since he isn't here.
          Johnny pulls out his revolver.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          This is your man.
          He moves closer to her, rubbing the gun against her cheek,
          her chin. The blood drains from her face as -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 29.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Why don't you give him a kiss-
          With terror in her eyes, Jennifer quickly kisses the gun-

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Nah, not like the peck you gave
          Matthew... let's see a real kiss.
          He slides the barrel into Jennifer's mouth. Jennifer gags
          instinctively. Johnny holds the back of her head, not
          allowing her to pull away, and offers some "encouragement."

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Breathe through your nose. Breathe
          through your nose like it was your
          first time.
          Johnny pulls the gun out just a tiny bit and pushes it back
          into her cheek, causing it to bulge out.
          Naturally, Stanley and Andy both find this hysterical.
          Especially once Jennifer begins to cry.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)

                         (TO JENNIFER)
          On your knees.
          Jennifer complies. Johnny holds the gun in front of his
          crotch and again forces it into Jennifer's mouth.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          if I don't like your enthusiasm, I
          may cum early.
          (cocks the gun)
          And that's something you really
          don't want.
          Jennifer has no choice. She begins to fellate the gun, as
          deep as she can take it without gagging.
          Johnny closes his eyes and feigns pleasure. Finally, he's
          had enough. He retracts the gun as Jennifer recoils, gags.
          Her eyes begin to scan the cabin for any way out of this hell
          as Andy stands up from the couch.

                         ANDY
          My turn.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 29A.

                         STANLEY
          Come on, let Matthew have a go.
          It's his girlfriend and he hasn't
          even wet his whistle yet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 30.

                         MATTHEW
          I...I ddd...don't want to.
          Johnny walks up to Matthew, angrily, and slaps him across the
          face. He points to Jennifer.

                         JOHNNY
          What do you mean you don't want to?

                         (TEASING)
          sh...she likes me... she kissed me.
          Now shut up and prove it.
          Matthew holds his fist against his face.

                         ANDY
          Aw, fuck it. I ain't waiting.
          Andy grabs the VODKA BOTTLE. He walks over to Jennifer,
          still on her knees, and positions the bottle right in front
          of his crotch.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          Suck it, bitch.
          Jennifer opens her mouth and moves her head toward the
          bottle. As she maneuvers the bottle-neck into her mouth, her
          eye catches a large shard of glass next to Andy's boot.
          As soon as Andy turns around to smile at his friends,
          Jennifer grabs the bottle and cracks it upside his kneecap.
          Andy immediately grabs his leg and falls to the floor.
          The guys start laughing as--
          Jennifer leaps up from the floor and rushes over to her
          purse. She quickly pulls out a canister of mace -
          Before the guys even register what is happening Jennifer is
          racing at Stanley --
          As he brings the camera down he's met with a spray of mace.
          He clutches his face, screaming in pain --
          And like that - Jennifer is out the back door.

          35 EXT. CABIN - DAWN 35

          Jennifer leaps over the porch steps and sprints across the
          backyard as the first light creeps through the trees. Within
          seconds, she's in the woods.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 31.

          36 EXT. WOODS - DAWN 36

          Jennifer runs for all she's worth. Every few yards, she
          looks behind her, just to make sure that no one is chasing
          her. The morning light now fully visible. Then, just as she
          turns back around, Jennifer smacks right into something and
          goes sprawling.
          When her vision comes into focus she sees the side of a shiny
          black boot. Next to it, the long slim barrel of a shotgun.
          Jennifer looks up at the figure.

                         FIGURE
          Whoa, whoa, whoa there. Easy
          darlin'.
          The Figure extends his hand. As Jennifer reaches for it, she
          sees his jacket pull away from his chest, revealing a silver
          badge. She's found SHERIFF STORCH, a small town sheriff with
          a small town charm that can easily be confused as smarmy.

                         JENNIFER
          Help me. Please!
          Standing next to the Sheriff, also holding a hunting rifle,
          is Earl. Earl looks over at the Sheriff.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Okay, okay, I gotcha.
          The Sheriff helps Jennifer to her feet.

                         EARL
          I know this one. She rented the
          place down on Mockingbird Trail.

                         JENNIFER
          I was assaulted! They broke into
          the cabin! They had a gun-
          Jennifer breaks down again.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Ma'am, please, you have to calm
          down.
          But Jennifer is hysterical, desperately holding back tears.

                         JENNIFER
          In my mouth! He put a gun in my
          mouth! You don't understand...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 32.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Ma'am, It's okay. I'm the Sheriff.
          You need to take a deep breath and
          tell me what happened.
          Jennifer forces herself to take a deep breath and manages to
          pull herself together.

                         JENNIFER
          Four men. It was four of them.
          They broke into my cabin... They
          assaulted me!
          Earl just watches not knowing what to do.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Are you hurt? Do you need a
          hospital?
          Jennifer shakes her head.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Okay, good. That's good. Did you
          get a good look at them? Can you
          ID 'em?

                         JENNIFER
          Yes, I'd seen them before.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Around here?

                         JENNIFER
          At the service station right
          outside of town. They work there.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (TO EARL)
          John Miller no doubt.

                         JENNIFER
          Yes. They called him Johnny.
          There was a heavy set guy too--

                         AND --
          Sheriff Storch shakes his head and rolls his eyes.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Sounds like them boys been up to no
          good. Alright Earl. You best head
          on back. Me and Miss...

                         JENNIFER
          Hills. Jennifer Hills.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Me and Miss Hills are gonna head on
          over to the cabin and straighten
          'em out.

          37 BRT. CABIN - DAY 37
          Sheriff Storch and Jennifer pull up to the cabin. They both
          get out of the cruiser. With his double barrel shotgun in
          hand, Sheriff Storch begins walking up toward the porch.

          38 INT. CABIN - DAY 38 

          Sheriff Storch and Jennifer enter the cabin. It appears
          empty.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Hello?

                         (BEAT)
          Miller? Miller, this is the
          Sheriff. if you and your boys are
          still in there, you come on out
          right now.
          Sheriff Storch disappears into the kitchen for a second...
          then back out as he makes his way over to the foot of the
          stairs. He looks up the staircase.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Miller, if you're up there, you'll
          be leaving by the window.
          No answer. Sheriff Storch looks at Jennifer.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Stay here.
          Sheriff Storch heads up the stairs. Jennifer, uncomfortable
          at being left alone, backs away to the wall. Every noise,
          every foot step makes her shiver.
          After a few seconds, the Sheriff comes back to the top of the
          stairs.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 34.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          It's empty.
          He walks back down.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          No sign of 'em. If they were here,
          they're gone now.
          Sheriff Storch makes his way through and walks back into--

          39 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 39

          Jennifer follows him and watches as he inspects it closely.
          His eyes fall on the box of liquor bottles.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          You here alone? 

                         JENNIFER
          Yes.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (RE: LIQUOR)
          With all this?

                         JENNIFER
          I wasn't going to drink it all this
          weekend. I... I planned on being
          here for a couple of months.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Drink some tonight?

                         JENNIFER
          Yes, well, they were. They forced
          me to.
          He moves away and walks back through the cabin.
          As he does, he spots the glass shattered on the floor... and
          the nearby THONG and BRA that Andy flung at her.
          Takes a long hard look at them, then looks back up to
          Jennifer.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          One of them, he was up there, went
          through everything.

          Sheriff Storch taps the broken glass with his thick boot.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          (pointing to the glass)
          They do this, too?

                         JENNIFER
          Please, I don't care about those
          things. They shoved a gun in my
          mouth...
          Jennifer breaks down again as the Sheriff moves toward her. 

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Okay, okay Ma'am. It's okay now.
          Them boys are gone. You're safe
          now.
          Jennifer nods to him, still shaken. Storch looks to the lock 
          on the back door. 
          He walks toward the back door and turns the dead bolt back 
          and forth.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) 
          (re: back door)
          Was this locked?

                         JENNIFER
          Yes. Of course.

          40 EXT. CABIN - DAY 40 

          Sheriff Storch steps onto the porch. Jennifer follows.
          Sheriff Storch looks down and sees the dead bird at his feet.
          He pokes it with the barrel of his shotgun.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          How long you been here?

                         JENNIFER
          Just a few days.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Anything strange happen before
          this? You have a run in with any
          of these guys?

                         JENNIFER
          No. Not really. I stopped for gas
          and directions.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 36.

          41 INT. CABIN - DAY 41

          Back inside, Sheriff Storch hooks his fingers into his belt
          and continues to look around.
          His eyes casually fall upon the roach sitting in the ashtray.
          He picks it up and smells it.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Ma'am, is this your marijuana
          cigarette? 
           Suddenly, Jennifer realizes that simple possession might not
          go over in this small town like it does in Manhattan.

                         JENNIFER
          Uh... n...no. The men probably
          left it.
          Sheriff Storch walks over to Jennifer until he's standing
          directly in front of her.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          You mean to tell me that one of
          these guys was wearing lipstick?
          Storch holds up the roach. Jennifer notices the lipstick
          smear on the rolling paper. She casts her eyes downward.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          This ain't the big city.
          Sheriff Storch stands uncomfortably close. Slowly, he walks
          closer up to Jennifer's face, stares into her eyelids. Pulls
          down one of them. Then the other. Then his gaze falls down
          to her chest... her ample cleavage. His stare lingers a bit
          too long.

                         JENNIFER
          Please, I swear. I didn't make it
          up. I may have smoked a joint, but-
          Sheriff Storch lifts his walkie-talkie to his mouth.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          (into the walkie-talkie)
          This is Sheriff Storch. I'm at the
          Mockingbird Cabin. I gonna need
          some backup.
          The words out of the Sheriff's mouth seem almost surreal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 37.

                         JENNIFER

                         (BECOMING FRANTIC)
          Backup? What could you possibly
          need back up for? I'm the victim.
          Sheriff Storch holds up his hand, cutting her off.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Ma'am. You've been drinking and
          smoking marijuana, and you got
          enough alcohol here to put our
          whole town three sheets to the
          wind. You're running around in
          your nighty at the crack of dawn...
          You need to see this from my point
          of view.

                         JENNIFER
          What?! They were here! They
          assaulted me! You've got to
          believe me!

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          I just want to get to the bottom of
          it. You're making serious
          accusations bout' boys I've know
          since they was kids, and you 
          haven't been all together truthful
          now have you?

                         (BEAT)
          Now please, against the wall.
          Angry and ashamed, Jennifer walks over and places her palms
          against the wall, her legs pressed tightly together.
          Sheriff Storch inches up behind her. He taps the inside of
          her thigh with his shotgun.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Shoulder width apart, face to the
          wall.
          Jennifer has no choice but to comply.
          He pats up and down Jennifer's side. When he gets to the
          swell of her breast, he slides his hand to the front ever so
          slightly. Jennifer reflexively turns--

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Face to the wall!
          Sheriff Storch puts his hand to the side of her face and puts
          it to the wall. Jennifer cringes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 37A.
          Then he kicks her leg out wide with a firm Boot as he starts
          to frisk her entire body, creeping his hands ever so close to
          her crotch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 38.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          I want the whole story, now. The
          whole thing.

                         (SLOWLY)
          Start with telling me what those
          boys did.
          A long, dreadful beat hangs in the air as--

          JOHNNY (O.S.)
          Yeah, and tell the truth, show
          Horse.
          Jennifer snaps her head around again to see Johnny enter the
          cabin as Andy and Stanely push Matthew in front of them.
          Johnny walks over to Jennifer. He stands next to the
          Sheriff.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Better yet, let's show him. As I
          recall, those pretty little lips
          couldn't get enough.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (MOCK SURPIRSE)
          Really?
          Sheriff Storch then takes the barrel of his shotgun and
          pushes down the top of Jennifer's blouse.
          Jennifer's paralyzed as he runs the shotgun across her
          nipple.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)

                         (TO JENNIFER)
          They do this to you?
          Jennifer is too terrified to speak. Sheriff Storch then
          slips the shotgun down between her legs.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          I asked you a question.
          Jennifer trembles with fear.

                         JENNIFER
          Please...

                         JOHNNY
          Show him those teeth, Show Horse.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 38A.
          Sheriff Storch brings the gun back up to her mouth - slides
          it under Jennifer's top lip and pushes it up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 39.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Whinny.
          With her top lip forced up by the barrel of the shotgun,
          Jennifer can only make a GRUNTING noise. Sheriff Storch
          takes the shotgun out of Jennifer's mouth and places it flush
          against the side of her head. He pushes her to the floor.
          Jennifer lets out a YELP as she falls.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          I said, whinny.
          Jennifer makes a pathetic SOUND. Not really a whinny, but
          more of a half-cry, half-snort. Naturally, this amuses Andy
          and Stanley -- who is, of course, filming it -- to no end.

                         STANLEY
          Oh, man. Oh, man.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (TO JENNIFER)
          On your knees. And keep going.
          Jennifer gets to her knees. As instructed, she whinnies,
          interspersed with sobs. Johnny slaps her ass viciously.

                         JOHNNY
          Keep whinnying!
          Jennifer looks up at Sheriff Storch with pleading eyes.
          Sheriff Storch picks her up by her hair but--
          Jennifer comes up swinging -- connecting with the Sheriff's
          face. The slightest scratch across his lip.
          Sheriff Storch turns beet red. He backhands her across the
          face sending her back down to the floor. A thin line of
          blood flows from her nose. The Sheriff looks over to Johnny,
          licks his lip and nods his head.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Think you outta tame this little
          mare of yours.
          Johnny takes the Sheriff's lead.

                         JOHNNY
          Alright, come on, Show Horse. Get
          up. Or you won't get a sugar cube.
          Jennifer struggles to her feet. She stands in front of them,
          defenseless. Johnny grabs her hair and pulls her head far
          back. She lets out a half-moan.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)

                         (TO MATTHEW)
          Take off your clothes. We're about
          to pop your cherry.
          Matthew shakes his head. His wrist is not beat red from the
          rubber bands. Snap!

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          I'm not asking, now cut that rubber
          band shit faggot.

                         STANLEY
          Come on, Matthew. You want to talk
          the talk, then walk the walk, you
          virgin.
          Johnny flicks open a pocket knife. He tickles Jennifer's
          bottom lip with the blade, then gently runs it down her chin,
          past her neck, and between her breasts, just before stopping
          at the waistband, then he slices the waistband of her pants -
          her pants drop to the floor.

                         JOHNNY

                         (TO MATTHEW)
          Do it now. Or else I slice her
          chin to cunt.
          This gets Matthew moving. A few seconds later, he's in his
          boxer shorts, with his hands crossed in front of his crotch.
          Johnny grabs him and throws him up against the wall. He then
          yanks his boxers down. Matthew immediately covers up his
          crotch.

                         STANLEY
          Matthew, what the hell? It's not
          even hard!
          Matthew sweats profusely.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Well, maybe it's not totally his
          fault. After all, she's not doing
          much to get his motor running.
          Sheriff Storch looks back to Jennifer.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Dance.
          Jennifer begins to cry again.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Stop it. Or else I'll really give
          you something to cry about. Now
          dance for the boy...
          Jennifer starts to dance in the middle of the room. It is
          sad, pathetic, and downright frightening.

                         JOHNNY
          Come on. Move that rear of your's
          Show Horse. Prance for us.
          Sheriff Storch stalks around her, taking it all in, then he
          walks back in closer to her, in her face.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          You dance like that in those city
          clubs?
          Jennifer closes her eyes. Tears stream down her face.

                         STANLEY
          She dance like that they'd throw
          her butt to the curb.

                         JOHNNY
          Prance like you mean it. Like you
          do when you want to get laid.
          With a swift, hard backhand, Sheriff Storch smacks her ass
          and hard.

                         ANDY
          That'll get her moving.
          The guys hoot and holler. Except for Matthew, who looks as
          if he too is about to cry.

                         MATTHEW
          Ok..kkay, I'll d...do it.
          Matthew walks slowly over to Jennifer. With no warning,
          Matthew takes Jennifer's face in his hands and kisses her.
          The men HOWL with sadistic glee. Jennifer slaps him right
          across the face, then she tries to run but--
          Sheriff Storch forces her to the ground. He walks up to
          Matthew.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Don't waste my time you thickheaded
          prick.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 42.
          Johnny pushes Matthew down on top of her.
          Jennifer instinctively swings and connects with Matthew's
          face - He recoils in pain - but the guys cheer him on as they
          decide to help him out. Andy tears open her shirt, Johnny
          yanks down her panties. Jennifer claws and kicks at all of
          them as she desperately tries to fight him off.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Get her legs!
          Sheriff Storch kneels down and holds Jennifer's arms above
          her head. Johnny takes one leg; Andy takes the other.
          Matthew moves on top of her. Jennifer lets out an inhuman
          SCREAM, the vocal culmination of it all.
          ON JENNIFER'S FACE: Her eyes are tightly shut as she goes in
          and out of focus.
          Suddenly, a cell phone RINGS. Sheriff Storch looks down at
          his pocket, then over to Stanley.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Put that thing down and hold her
          arms, keep her quiet.
          Stanley places the CAM on top of the table - it's still
          getting everything.
          Sheriff Storch walks a few paces away from the rape. He
          looks down at the screen of his phone.
          On the PHONE is a photo of an angelic little girl with the
          banner of CHASTITY. Storch presses a button.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Hello, Angel.

          CHASTITY (V.0.)
          Hi, Daddy. You at the station?
          Jennifer SCREAMS out. Sheriff Storch keeps his attention on
          the phone call.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (INTO PHONE)
          No, Angel. Out on a call.
          WIDESHOT: In the foreground, Sheriff Storch speaks casually
          to his daughter. In the background, Jennifer's legs are the
          only visual cues of the struggle that goes on right behind.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (INTO PHONE)
          It's okay. You need something?

          CHASTITY (V.0.)
          Daddy it's Sunday. You always make
          breakfast before church.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Yeah, yeah... well, Daddy's busy,
          Angel. Tell mother I'm running a
          little late.
          Sheriff Storch stares at the phone for a second, then slides
          the phone back into his pocket. As he turns back around
          Jennifer, with all her strength, bucks Matthew off.
          The guys start laughing hysterically.
          She finally gets her hands free and lands a barrage of
          punches in Matthew's face.

                         JOHNNY
          Jesus, Matthew. You're getting
          your ass whooped by a girl!
          Matthew snaps: He wraps his hands around her neck and begins
          pumping away like a lunatic. For some reason, the anger
          allows him to perform.
          Jennifer struggles to breathe. Luckily, before all oxygen to
          her brain is cut off, Matthew stops. He SCREAMS as he
          finishes. His hands fall from her neck as he collapses on
          top of her.
          The MEN all cheer as Matthew staggers to his feet -- weak.
          He looks like he could throw up -- and he does - right off to
          the side as the others just lose it!
          Jennifer curls herself into a ball and SOBS.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (TO MATTHEW)
          You can thank us later.
          Matthew recovers, gets up and runs to the bathroom. Johnny
          points to the vomit.

          Clean this shit up.

                         STANLEY
          Make her do it.

                         JOHNNY

                         (ANGRILY)
          Just do it you piece of shit!
          Jennifer grabs the end of the coffee table and forces herself
          up. She steadies herself, keeping one hand on the wall, and
          stumbles to the back door. Surprisingly, none of the men
          attempt to stop her. They don't even look in her direction.
          Jennifer staggers out the back door, trying to catch her
          breath as she fearfully stumbles off into the woods.

          42 EXT. WOODS - DAY 42 

          Like a zombie, Jennifer shuffles through the woods, oblivious
          to the cold air, rocks, thorns, mud, as her bare feet move
          her along.
          She desperately continues on through, looking for a way out.
          But in her state, she has no sense of navigation. She
          continues to lose herself further and further into the
          forest.
          As she finally steps into the clearing, the melancholy notes
          of a harmonica shatter the stillness... She's made her way to-

          43 EXT. FISHING HOLE - DAY 43

          Andy sits on a log blowing softly into the harmonica as the
          rest of the guys lounge around casually as if they
          instinctively knew she'd end up here. Jennifer is too
          shocked to move, too tired to cry.
          Jennifer tries to escape but Johnny stops her. He grabs her
          by the shoulders and throws her to Andy who smacks her down
          in the shallow water. Andy pounces down on her back.
          Stanley kneels down right in front of Jennifer's face. He
          places the MiniDV cam only a few feet in front of her. He
          then turns the LCD so it's facing Jennifer -- so she can
          actually watch herself being abused.
          Andy pulls her eyelids wide open and holds them there.

                         STANLEY
          You ever get mace in your eyes,
          bitch? It smarts.

          Andy shoves her face down into the water - then pulls her up.
          ON MINIDV CAM: Eyes pried wide open, Jennifer gags as the
          dirty water pours from her nose - mouth - she desperately
          tries to breathe --
          Andy shoves her face down again and again as Stanley films.

                         STANLEY (CONT'D) 
          Hold her head down! Hold it down!! 

                         JOHNNY
          Alright. This filly's got a few
          more races to run--
          Sheriff Storch approaches Jennifer. Although she can't even 
          turn around, she senses their presence.
          Storch gets down into her face.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          I hope you got some fight left in
          you. I like it rough.

                         JENNIFER

                         (BARELY AUDIBLE)
          Please. Please. I'm... so hurt...
          Sheriff Storch spits onto the ground.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Not to worry Darlin'. I'm an ass
          man.
          Sheriff Storch takes off his belt and unbuckles his pants.
          He kneels down behind her..
          Jennifer SHRIEKS as her face contorts with a completely new
          level of pain as her head is thrust back down.
          Then, out of the corner of her eye, Jennifer catches a
          glimpse of the Sheriff's GUN, still sitting in its holster.
          Her eyes immediately go to Stanley who's busy swapping out
          the MINI-DV tape and replacing it with a new one--
          Then she sees Matthew leaning against a tree, a vacant look
          in his eye twisting a rubber band through his fingers.
          Andy site on is ass, playing his harmonica... Her eyes
          continue to scan the area for Johnny who's nowhere in sight.
          Then immediately her eyes dart back to the GUN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 45A.
           As Jennifer's body is being jerked back and forth, she
          reaches - and reaches - closer with each stretch when--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 46.
          A heavy work boot comes down on her hand, crushing it.
          Jennifer looks up.
          Johnny glares down at her, then unzips his pants as he moves
          in closer to her face.

                         JOHNNY
          No teeth Show Horse. No teeth.
          Her vision grows hazy. The sky, water, and ground all seem
          to meld together.

                         TO BLACK:

          BACK IN ON:

          44 EXT. FISHING HOLE - LATER 44

           Cruel laughter brings Jennifer back to. Somehow she manages
           to lift her head to see Stanley pulling up his pants.

                          ANDY
           Wow, Stanley, 30 seconds. Must be
           a record for you.

                         JOHNNY
          Don't you know you should wait for
          the lady?

                         STANLEY
          Bitch was too tight, even after
          ya'll... Sides, she's all bloody...
          I wanted to finish up.

                         ANDY
          Right and we thought Matthew here
          was gonna be the pussy. 

                         JOHNNY
          Don't be so proud of yourself Andy.
          I clocked you at just over two
          minutes.
          Jennifer musters up her last ounce of strength and gets to
          her feet. The men all stare, impressed at her resolve.
          Jennifer's torn clothes hang loosely off her body as she
          staggers away and wanders aimlessly away from them. It's a
          miracle she can even walk.
          She continues until the forest ends and she comes upon a--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 46A.

          45 EXT. WOODS - DAY 45

           She staggers up to the edge of the woods and comes to a
           clearing, she leans on a tree and sobs hysterically, breaking
           down. 

          AA45 EXT. BRIDGE, TREES - DAY AA45

           Ahead of her a dirt road leads to a small bridge and an open 
          area.
          Painfully she staggers towards the bridge, her beaten and
          bruised body pained with each step.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 47.
          The others appear behind her. They laugh at her as she
          continues further down the bridge.

          A45 EXT. BRIDGE - DAY A45

          Jennifer doesn't bother to turn around. She continues down
          the bridge, looking at the rushing water on both sides.
          She moves to one of the railings.
          The Sheriff looks at her and cocks the shotgun.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Sorry. it was fun while it lasted.

                         JOHNNY
          Yeah, too bad we have to put you
          down, Show Horse.
          in a final act of defiance, Jennifer falls back off the
          bridge and into the murky, moving water.
          immediately, the men rush to the edge of the bridge.
          The Sheriff's gun cocked and ready-- Tracking down the water -
          Not a sign.
          They all look down, waiting, still nothing.

                         STANLEY
          Where'd she go?

                         ANDY
          She's gotta come up for air
          sometime.

                         STANLEY 
          Current's got her. Shit, in her 
          condition she's already drowned.
          Johnny looks to the Sheriff who's gun is trained on the water
          waiting for something... anything.

                         JOHNNY
          Sheriff?
          Sheriff Storch pulls back his gun, and adjusts his hat, deep
          in thought.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          All you get your butts down there,
          check under the bridge, both banks,
          in the trees right now.
          They all look at him. 

                         ANDY 
          I ain't got my waders... 

                         SHERIFF STORCH 
          I said right fuekin' now before I 
          throw you over! 

          46 EXT. BRIDGE -- DAY 46 

           The guys have returned. They are all muddy and wet. Storch 
           stands stoic still looking down at the water. He turns to 
           them. 

                          JOHNNY 
           Nothin'... 

                          SHERIFF STORCH 
           Listen up. 'Bout six miles 
           downstream the creek ends in
           Hendersonville. somewhere between 
           here and there we're gonna find
           her. We split up. We check the 
           banks, in the timber, under a rock, 
          hell if you see a hole big enough
          for a rat I want it checked out.
          And don't stop 'til you find me a
          body.

                         (BEAT)
          Don't just stand there, get! 

                         STANLEY

                         (EXASPERATED)
          Six miles, Sheriff? She's at the
          bottom of the river. She's gator
          bait. I think we should just let
          it go.
          A single vein pulses in Sheriff Storch's temple. He grabs
          Stanley by the collar.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (PURE RAGE)

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          You just shut your trap and do
          every goddamned thing I say. I got
          a wife a kid and one in the oven.
          There is no way that I'm going to 
          let anything happen to them because
          you're too stupid and too sloppy to
          clean up your fuckin' mess.
          The weight of the Sheriff's words register on all of them...
          except Matthew who oddly enough has started to come around --
          as if he just woke up in the middle of this nightmare.

                         MATTHEW
          She slipped and fell!
          Matthew stands up, nervous, jittery, coming unglued.

                         MATTHEW (CONT'D)
          None of us touched her. I saw it.
          She was just... it was an accident.
          Johnny rolls his eyes and shakes his head.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Can someone get this dipshit outta
          my face! I don't need none of you
          screwing the pooch on this, least
          of all numbnuts over there.
          Sheriff Storch lets go of Stanley's collar and gives it a
          quick pat, almost like an imperceptible apology for his
          behavior.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Now let's move... find me a body!

          47 EXT. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER - DAY 47 

           The reservoir is much calmer at these parts. Sheriff stands
           on watch as-
           Stanley and Andy come from the water in waders having just 
           searched the water.
          Matthew stands where they just came from. He stays, staring
          at the swamp like water as if Jennifer was somewhere in 
          there.
          Johnny finishes off a cigarette and flicks it.

                         ANDY
          Nothing. Not a damn thing.

                         JOHNNY
          Well, what now?
          Storch takes another look down the river, scanning it.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          The body'll turn up. One way or
          another. Every day we check the
          ravine, from the bridge, straight 
          through down here, then back. Two
          shifts a day until we find 
          something. 'Cause with no body, 
          you're all as fucked as she is.

                         STANLEY
          For how long?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          'Til I say! Okay?! Andy, you go
          back to the cabin and get rid of her
          shit. All of it! Burn it. And we
          need to sanitize that place
          something good. I don't want so
          much as a stray hair left.

                         (TO JOHNNY)
          Get her car to the shop. Strip it
          down to its last damn nut.

                         JOHNNY
          I'll buff out the serial numbers
          too. Sell the parts at salvage.
          Storch nods in approval as his eyes wander to the camera.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          .and give me that.
          Sheriff Storch rips the camera from Stanley's hands. He
          pulls out the tape.
          He throws the tape to the ground and stomps on it, smashing
          it to bits. Stanley opens his mouth to say something, thinks
          better of it, and closes it quickly.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)

          Now let's go, we got shit to do.
          Matthew continues to stare off into the distance, waist deep
           in the water. 
          48 ER's. WOODS - DUSK 48 
          CLOSE UP on a match. Dirty fingers pull the match across the
          flint on the side of a matchbox. The match explodes to life.
          A hand drops the match on top of Jennifer's belongings: her
          clothes, laptop, the dry goods she purchased at the store.
          It's all piled up on the grass.
          Johnny, Stanley, and Andy watch quietly as the flames and
          smoke from the fire reach into the sky. Andy throws a metal
          container of gasoline onto the ground.

                         ANDY
          So that's everything. Right down
          to her little tit sling.

                         JOHNNY
          And there was no trace at all?
          Nothing in the woods? In the
          shallows?
          Andy shakes his head. Stanley rubs his eyes hard.

                         STANLEY
          I'm starving, man.

                         ANDY
          Idiot wanted to stay there. He was
          walking around in the water,

          Sheriff Storch pulls up to his house. He parks in the
          driveway and gets out of his car.
          He walks slowly up to his front door. Just as he reaches out
          to grab the door handle, the front door opens. MRS. STORCH
          is there to greet him.

          MRS. STORCH
          Gone all day. I got nervous.
          Anything worth telling?

          50 INT. SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 50

          Mrs. Storch closes the door behind them. Chastity races from
          her room holding a piece of paper.

                         CHASTITY
          Daddy! Daddy!
          Sheriff Storch picks up his daughter and kisses her head.

          then heads into the kitchen.

          51 EXT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 51 

          Sheriff Storch's cruiser pulls up to Earl's house and comes
          to a stop in a cloud of dust.

          52 EXT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 52 

          Sheriff Storch stands on Earl's porch, pounds on the door.

          EARL (O.S.)
          It's open.
          Sheriff Storch pushes open the screen door.

          He enters. Immediately, he brings his hand to his mouth and
          coughs violently.

          Every time I come in here this

          Earl's bent over one of the tanks, elbow-deep in fetid water.

          Yeah, but business gets better.
          That's the trade off.

          hazard.
          Sheriff Storch reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of
          keys. He holds them in the air and JINGLES them. Earl
          finally looks up, confused.

          She left?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Yeah, I couldn't make heads or

          cigarettes, case of booze, looked 
          to me like she was a party girl...
          a very wild one.

          54 EXT. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER - DAY 54 

          THE CAMERA tilts down from the treeline and falls back on
          Hendersonville. It's serene, peaceful and lonely. 
          Matthew sits in a small boat. He's been patrolling for
          Jennifer's body, but now the boat just sits in the middle of
          the swamp where the river runs out.
          He stares out into the water as we slowly creep closer, and
          closer until we're extremely close on his face, his eyes
          unmoving.

          A55 EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY A55

          POV: A car with two women pulls up to the gas pump. Johnny
          comes out of the garage and saunters over to them.
          Johnny playfully harasses the women. To a casual observer,
          it would seem harmless. But we know it could be the prelude
          to something unspeakable.
          Finally, the women pull away. Johnny walks back into the
          garage, a smug, self-satisfied smile on his face.

          55 INT. SERVICE STATION, GARAGE - DAY 55 

          Andy is bent over Jennifer's car, or at least what's left of
          it. At this point, it's nothing more than a shell. He wears
          a welding helmet and is hard at work with a blowtorch.

                         ANDY
          (from under the car)
          Round up some tail out there?

                         JOHNNY
          Maybe. Guarantee you they'll be
          back.
          Johnny looks up as Stanley stumbles into the garage, holding
          a six pack of beer.

                         STANLEY
          It's happy hour.

          Johnny opens his hands, signaling Stanley to toss him a can.
          Andy shuts off the blowtorch and lifts up the helmet.

                         ANDY
          Fucking A.
          Johnny cracks open the beer and takes a gulp. He wipes the
          back of his hand across his mouth.

                         JOHNNY

                         (TO STANLEY)
          You bought beer? What'd your
          mother put you back on an
          allowance?
          They all laugh.

                         STANLEY
          Just figured we deserved a break.
          Andy holds up his beer in a mock toast.

                         ANDY
          To your moma.
          Johnny points to Andy, his beer still in his hand.

                         JOHNNY
          Just one, you hear me? Don't need
          you passing out on your watch you
          lightweight.
          Andy takes a large sip.

                         ANDY
          Heck, just let Matthew take all the
          shifts. He's been down there
          everyday anyway. Even when it's
          not his turn. 
          They all look to one another.

                         JOHNNY
          The fuck's he doing down there?

                         ANDY
          I don't know. Last time I saw him,
          he wasn't lookin' too good.
          Maybe we should give him a break.
          Pull him off all together.

          Bullshit. It's been over two
          weeks. I'm tired of searching. If
          she didn't turn up yet, she ain't
          gonna.

                         JOHNNY
          You'll keep lookin' till I tell ya'
          to stop.
           As he turns away there is a bag of Stanley's pork rinds, he 
           grabs it and throws it at Stanley.

                          JOHNNY (CONT'D) 
           Here's your supplies. 
           Andy starts to laugh as Johnny exits. 

          56 EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY 56

           From a distance we see Andy laughing and Johnny walking off.

          A57 INT. CABIN - DAY (FORMERLY SCENE 62) A57 

          Matthew stands in the main room staring at the floor - the
          exact place where he raped Jennifer. After a long, drawn out
          moment, he turns and walks to--

          B57 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY (FORHERLY SCENE 62) B57 

          He looks down to the toilet, then the bathtub. He turns
          around accidentally catches his reflection in the mirror.

          His greasy, unkempt hair hangs in front of his eyes. He
          pushes it to the side and stares at himself for a long time.
          Finally, Matthew reaches to the light switch, he flicks it
          off. Immediately, the room goes dark. But the second it
          does...
          JENNIFER is sitting on the bed just like when they first met.

          DEAD, DRENCHED, BEATEN, BATTERED, AND DECAYED, BUT IT'S

                         JENNIFER --
          Matthew is paralyzed with fear, he tries to turn as a
          grizzly, decayed hand grabs his forehead. Another grabs hold
          of his throat.
          A mouth caked with dirt and dried blood begins to kiss up his
          neck, his face-
          Matthew screams wildly

          The Sheriff's car sits in the driveway. It's dark, but for
          the light from a TV strobing against the drapes.

          All is quiet. Sheriff Storch reclines in his lazyboy. Mrs.
          Storch is on the sofa rifling through a TV journal.
          The phone RINGS. Sheriff Storch lifts his head up. Mrs.
          Storch reaches over and answers.

          Earl?

          Earl fidgets with his tanks, cleaning, scraping algae. But
          you can tell he's nervous about something.

                         EARL
          She was looking for that Miss
          Hills. Says no one's seen her in
          over a month. Ain't that about when
          she split?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Yeah, and... you know the story.

                         EARL
          I don't know. I wasn't there. I
          think you should call her back. I
          mean heck, sheriff, you may have
          been the last person to see her.
          The Sheriff's blood starts to boil, he wants to say more, but
          looks to his wife... then controls himself.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          Sheriff?

                         SHERIFF STORCH

          Can you believe there used to be a

          Let's take a break. My dogs are
          barking something fierce.
          Earl plops down on the log.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          You're getting old, Earl. I
          remember back when you and my old 
          man chased that buck out of the

          bagging it.

          Those were the good of days.
          Sheriff Storch joins Earl on the log. He reaches into his
          hunting bag and pulls out a bottle of really good whiskey.

          Wow, fan-cy. To what do I owe?
          Sheriff Storch smiles, screws off the top, and passes the
          bottle to Earl. Earl takes a swig.

          Earl drops to the ground like a rag doll. The bottle falls
          from his grasp. The whisky flows into the dirt.
          Sheriff Storch stands up, clutching his smoking shotgun.

          Sheriff Storch hovers over his prey. Suddenly, Earl's body
          spasms. His eyes flicker and a nauseating gurgle sounds from
          deep in his throat.

          Stanley is still on the ground, making disgusting noises. A
          combination of sobbing, puking, and wheezing.

                         STANLEY
          You can't tell him Johnny. You
          can't.
          Johnny ponders for a second.

                         ANDY
          Shit for brains here's right. We
          gotta stick together now.

                         STANLEY
          Please, Johnny. He finds out about
          this... that I had the tape---

                         JOHNNY
          No... no. We don't breathe a word
          of this.
          (points to them both)
          Not a damn word. Sheriff gets wind
          of this, we'll all be having
          "hunting accidents": We clear?
          Johnny slaps Stanley in the head again for good measure.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          in the meantime, find that little
          shitwhit Matthew. Me and him are
          gonna have a talk.

          66 INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 66 

          Johnny reclines on his couch, watching TV. One hand is down
          his pants and the other holds a bottle of whisky.
          Suddenly, there's a CRASH at his front door. Johnny looks up
          and puts down the bottle, not overly concerned.

                         JOHNNY
          Hello?
          No answer at the door. Johnny groans and gets off the couch,
          annoyed at being disturbed. He walks over to the front door
          and yanks it open.
          The front porch is empty. Just as he's about to close the
          door, he glances down. There's a dead bird on the stoop.
          Johnny narrows his eyes and looks out into the night. Then
          he closes the door and returns to the couch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 64.
          But as soon as he picks up the bottle, there's another CRASH
          at the front door. Johnny, now pissed, races to the front
          door and swings it open.
          A second dead bird has joined the first. Without closing the
          door, Johnny backs up into his house.
          A few seconds later, he returns to the front door, pistol in
          hand. He steps out onto the porch.

          67 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 67

          Johnny holds the gun in front of him. He pivots slowly from
          side to side, scanning the entire property. No more birds.
          In fact, nothing at all. Dead silence.

                         JOHNNY

                         (THREATENING)
          Who's out there?!
          No answer.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Shit ain't funny fuckers!!! See
          how funny a bullet in your ass is!
          When there's still no response -- Johnny finally backs up
          into the house and closes the door.

          68 INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 68

          Again, back to the couch. And again, the second his ass hits
          the cushion, another CRASH.

                         JOHNNY
          Got dammit!
          This time, Johnny races to the door and yanks it open,
          cocking the gun on the way and fires into the night.

          69 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 69

          Johnny causally looks down - but this time it's not a bird.
          It's a shoe... Jennifer's shoe.
          Johnny bends down and picks it up. He studies it. Frowns.
          Someone's gone too far. Then he hears something scurry off
          in-the distance.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 64A.
          Quickly Johnny gives chase - leaping off his porch and racing
          in the direction of the sound.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 65.
          Johnny stops, listens, and waits. Nothing but silence. He
          turns around in all directions.
          Johnny spits and turns around to walk back and as he does, he
          notices one of Matthew's colored RUBBER BANDS lying in the
          mud.

                         JOHNNY

                         (UNDER BREATH)
          Son of a bitch.

          70 INT. SHERIFF STARCH'S HOUSE - DAY 70

          Sheriff Storch enters, holding a bouquet of flowers. He
          closes the door behind him and walks in.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Helen?
          Within seconds, Mrs. Storch materializes, apron on and wiping
          her hands on a dish towel.

          MRS. STORCH
          Oh, they're beautiful...
          Sheriff Storch walks over and gives her a kiss on the cheek.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          I've been --

          MRS. STORCH
          No need to explain. You just
          buried your close friend. And you
          haven't taken a single day off.
          You're only human.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          I guess.

          MRS. STORCH
          Hey, maybe you can help me while I
          put these in water.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Help with what?

          MRS. STORCH
          We got this tape delivered it don't
          fit our machine. 

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          What tape?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 66.
          Mrs. Storch scurries over to the coffee table, grabs the
          MINIDV tape and hands it to him.

          MRS. STORCH
          it came this morning...
          But as Storch looks over the tape, the color, the markings...
          no, it couldn't be, he smashed that tape.

          MRS. STORCH (CONT'D)
          I think it might be Chastity's
          recital.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Did Chastity see this?

          MRS. STORCH
          No, like I said, we couldn't get it
          to play.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Where is she?

          MRS. STORCH
          Sleeping, why?
          Storch wipes his face with his hand, then shoves the tape
          into his shirt pocket.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          I'll... I'll be back...
          Sheriff Storch quickly turns away from his wife and hurries
          out the door.
          Mrs. Storch stands at the door and watches with growing
          curiosity as the cruiser peels out of the driveway, a cloud
          of dust in its wake.

          71 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - DAY 71

          Andy and Stanley pull up and get out of the truck as Johnny's
          been pacing.

                         ANDY
          So what's all this about, Johnny?
          Johnny takes out Jennifer's shoe and throws it at them. They
          both dodge a hit and look at the shoe on the ground.

                         (TERRIFIED)
          Where'd you get that?

                         JOHNNY
          Somebody threw it at my fuckin'
          door.
          Then snaps Matthew's rubber band at them it hits Stanley who
          winces.

                         STANLEY
          Jees, Matthew? Come on--

                         JOHNNY
          Did either of you find that little
          prick?

                         ANDY
          No. No one knows where he is--
          Suddenly, a car SCREECHES up - it's Storch and it looks as if
          he is going to drive his cruiser straight through the fence.

                         STANLEY
          Ah shit. This ain't good.
          Johnny picks the shoe up.
          Storch blasts out of his car, shotgun in hand. He cocks his
          shotgun and levels it directly at Stanley as he backs him up,
          planting the shotgun into his cheek.

                         STANLEY (CONT'D)

                         (CRYING)
          Please, Sheriff! I didn't do
          anything.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Then you want to tell me why this
          was dropped off at my house?! To
          my WIFE!
          Storch shoves the TAPE in Stanley's mouth - gagging him.
          Then turns to Johnny.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          What's on that tape?! Is this some
          kind of fucked up joke? I smashed
          the damn thing myself!

                         JOHNNY
          Nah, genius over here reloaded.
          Tape you smashed had nothing on it.
          Storch looks to Johnny - then snaps his gun towards him.

          Storch swings the gun back to Stanley.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Eat that tape fatboy.
          Andy starts to laugh as Starch trains the gun back on them-

                         STORCH
          Shut your pie hole. Think this is
          funny?! I'll have him shit it down
          your throat when's he done eating
          it. Got that boy?
          .LAM; The Sheriff fires a shot into the air. They all jump,
          Stanley covers his ears like it hurt.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          See, there's two kinds of crazy
          people. One likes to get buck
          naked and howl at the moon. The
          other kind does the exact same
          thing, only in my backyard. The
          first kind'I don't have to deal
          with, you know?
          The Sheriff walks right into Stanley's face as he continues
          to chew the plastic.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          The second kind, well... you're in
          my yard. 

                         JOHNNY
          It's Matthew, Sheriff. Stanley kept 
          the souvenir, but Matthew's the
          one that took it.
          The Sheriff backs off a beat, sizes up the situation.
          Johnny brings forth the shoe. Sheriff's eyes seethe with
          rage.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          The crazy bastard left me a

          Storch takes a deep breath. He looks at all of them, fuming.

          We don't know. Isn't coming around

          He fixes them all with a steely gaze and loads the shotgun
          again.

          72 EXT. CABIN - DAY 72 

          Matthew, disheveled and weary, stumbles up the steps of the
          cabin. We get the feeling that this is almost a daily
          pilgrimage, as if he returns here to assuage his guilt.
          He rests his head on the wooden railing of the porch, for a
          moment it looks as if he's about to cry.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          (from inside the cabin;
          creepy and ethereal)
          Matthew...
          Matthew's head snaps up. He's almost certain he imagined it,
          just like he's been imagining many things these days.

           But there is no one in sight. Matthew looks around from side
           to side, his eyes wide, filled with madness... . and then, he
           hears it again.

           VOICE (O.S.)
           Math...eeeeeee... . you...
           It's coming from upstairs - Matthew sprints up.

          74 INT. CABIN, UPSTAIRS - DAY 74

          Matthew, wild-eyed and panicked, gets to the top of the
          steps. He takes a heavy breath and then moves into the lone
          bedroom. seconds later he comes out, obviously empty.

                         MATTHEW

                         (SCREAMS)
          Where are you?!
          Barely a second later, he receives his answer.

          Matthew...
          This time, it's definitely coming from downstairs. Matthew
          glances down the staircase. When he sees that nobody is
          waiting at the bottom, he heads down there.
          But once his foot touches the third step, the board gives out
          as Matthew crashes down the steps, ass-over-tea kettle.

          75 INT. CABIN - DAY 75

          MATTHEW'S POV: His vision is completely blurry. He
          struggles to get his bearings as he lays at the bottom of the
          stairs; the side of his head rests on the floor. A thin
          line of blood has already started to run down his cheek.
          Matthew's vision starts to come back into focus as a BLURRY
          IMAGE starts to move away from him. As the IMAGE gets
          further away - it comes into focus - JENNIFER
          We see her now, wounds healed, only the faintest hint of the 
          beating and trauma she went through.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 71.
          Matthew grunts and groans as he tries to get up--

                         MATTHEW

                         (STAMMERS)
          I... I knew you were alive. I knew it.
          Jennifer turns to him now.

                         JENNIFER
          How do you know, Matthew?
          Matthew props himself up with his hands and manages to get
          into a sitting position.

                         MATTHEW
          Huh?

                         JENNIFER
          How do you know I'm alive? Are you
          sure you're'not dreaming again? 
          Matthew shakes his head quickly from side to side. He's not
          sure of anything any more.

                         MATTHEW
          I...am I dreaming?
          Jennifer pats the couch next to her.

                         JENNIFER
          Come here. Come sit down.
          Matthew staggers to his feet. He's overcome with emotion.

                         MATTHEW
          I... I... need to tell...
          Jennifer holds a single finger to her lips.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 72.

                         JENNIFER
          Shh... it's all okay, Matthew. I
          know that none of this was your
          fault. You tried to help me.

                         MATTHEW
          I did... I really did.

                         JENNIFER
          I know that, Matthew. Now come.
          Matthew sits down next to Jennifer. It's almost as if some
          force is controlling him. Matthew looks into her eyes.
          He leans forwards and rests his head in Jennifer's lap. He 
          finally lets himself go, like a child having a meltdown.

                         MATTHEW

                         (SOBBING)
          I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

                         JENNIFER
          (stroking his head)
          Shh...I know. I know you are.
          Matthew's so caught up in the moment, that he fails to notice
          A ROPE from the tool shed with a good SLIT KNOT being snaked
          around his neck.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          But tell me again, Matthew. I want
          to hear how sorry you are.
          Matthew's eyes fly open. Jennifer's hands jerk backwards.
          The rope digs into his flesh. He tries to speak but his
          windpipe can't produce any sound.
          Matthew rolls to the floor, Jennifer never loses her grasp.
          She stands over Matthew, twisting the rope as hard as she
          can. His eyes bulge, the veins in his face protrude--
          Realizing he's about to slip away forever, Matthew displays
          one last burst of strength but Jennifer uses her leverage to
          get her foot on his chest and pulls harder.
          Frightened and furious, Matthew whips Jennifer around again.
          But she refuses to let go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOXG PINK 10/29/09 73.
          Finally, Matthew's body has had enough. He feet stop kicking
          and just twitch. Then he just gasps like a fish dying out of
          water.
          Jennifer bends over Matthew. She's only inches from his
          face. He's alive, but in terrible shape.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          (whispers in his ear)
          Tell me again...
          CLOSE ON: Matthew's mouth. He can't actually speak; his
          voice box shattered. But he mouths the words.

                         MATTHEW

                         (STRUGGLING)
          I'm sorry.

                         JENNIFER
          I'm sorry? That's just not good
          enough.
          She pulls the slip knot around his neck again and begins to

                         CHOKE HIM--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Now I want you to cry like a little
          girl for me.
          Matthew begins to wail.

          A75 EXT. CABIN, DAY A75

           Matthews screams echoes out through woods, but his, much like
           Jennifer, go unheard.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          B75 EXT. WOODS. NIGHT B75

           Silence. A full moon hangs low in the night sky, casting an
           eerie glow over the entire area. A sense of calm restored.

                          DISSOLVE TO:

          C75 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - NIGHT C75

           Jennifer walks into focus - 
          We see her now, wounds healed, only the faintest hint of the
          beating and trauma she went through.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 73A.
          But in her eyes --- her eyes still tell the whole story. This 
           is no longer the Jennifer we've known. She looks down. 
           ANGLE ON: A BIBLE, the old moldy one from the dilapidated 
           shack. It rests on the windowsill - opened to a passage. 
          CZrO$E ON: Exodus 21:23-25: .And if any mischief follow, 
           than thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for 
           tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning for burning, 
           wound for wound, stripe for stripe.. 
          Jennifer looks up. 

                          JENNIFER 
           Forgive me father, for I will sin. 

          76 EST. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER - DAY 76
          Andy and Stanley make their way to the falls. They carry
          flashlights, but they're turned off as day has broken.
          Stanley shovels pork rinds into his mouth, and offers some to
          Andy. They are tired, weary, and you get the sense they have
          been looking all night.

                         STANLEY
          You want some? My last bag.

                         ANDY
          No, get that shit out of my face.

                         STANLEY
          What's your problem?

                         ANDY
          I'm tired, I'm hungry--

                         STANLEY
          I offered you--

                         ANDY
          I don't want that shit. I want
          real food, I want my bed, I want
          this bullshit to be over.

                         STANLEY
          Well the sooner we find Matthew... 

                         ANDY
          Yeah, that's right. The sooner we
          find Matthew what?

          Ain't it obvious? We drag that homo 
          back to the sheriff, he's a dead
          man.

                         STANLEY
          So what? Better him than me.

                         ANDY

                         (ANGRILY)
          You kept the tape! We're all
          getting heat for your stupidity!

                         (BEAT)
          Now let's just split up and get
          this over with.
          They both separate. Stanley heads around into the woods,
          Andy heads the other way.

          77 EXT. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER, WOODS - DAY 77

          We're with Stanley as he walks further into the woods, his
          eyes scan in all directions... but there is nothing there.

          78 EXT. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER, WATERLINE - DAY 78

          We're with Andy as he walks the waterline.

                         ANDY
          Matthew?!
          Then, Andy notices an uneven ripple in the water. He thinks
          nothing of it... until it happens again.
          This catches his eye. Slowly he makes his way over. The
          water has calmed now, but still, Andy has a sense that
          something is not right.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          Matthew!
          As he gets close to the water - he now sees his reflection...
          He squints his eyes trying to get a better look at what is
          beneath the surface --
          WHOOSH! SOMETHING runs right behind his back - the entire
          reflection caught in the water --
          Andy spins around - as he staggers into the water - no one is
          there... nothing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 74A.
          just the calm breeze through the trees -- but then a small
          outcrop of bushes rustle as if something just moved through.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 75.
          Andy calms - then makes his way over with purpose-

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          Only making it worse for yourself,
          Matt.
          Andy picks up his pace as he nears the tree line - right
          where he saw the movement.
          Out of the corner of his eye, he sees another branch swinging
          unnaturally. He races over--
          CLOSER: He can actually hear breathing - it's getting louder-

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          Matthew?-

          STANLEY JUMPS OUT--

                         STANLEY
          Boo!

                         ANDY
          Jesus! You bastard!
          Stanley laughs so hard he starts to cough -- Just as they're
          about to continue on - the sound of a harmonica breaks
          through. The same eerie tune.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          What the--?

                         STANLEY
          Prick's playing your song.
          He looks at Stanley.

                         ANDY
          The hell with the Sheriff, I'm
          gonna kill him myself... MATTHEW!!

          79 EXT. WOODS - DAY 79

          Andy and Stanley run through the woods, trying to find the
          source of the sound.

                         ANDY
          You're ass is grass Matthew!! 
          Branches and leaves fly by as Andy barrels through the
          foliage. Stanley tries to keep up, but it's no use.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 76.
          The SOUND changes direction - they look off to see SOMEONE
          flash through the trees.

                         ANDY (CONT'D)
          There he is. That way!

                         STANLEY
          Matthew! You're a dead man!
          They race off after the sound.

          80 EXT. WOODS - DAY 80 

          They continue on - Stanley doesn't look too good.

                         ANDY
          Don't you pass out on me. I ain't
          dragging your ass back.
          Suddenly, the tune stops. Andy stops in his tracks, trying
          to figure out which way to proceed. Suddenly, Stanley hears
          another sound. Crying.

                         STANLEY
          Hear that?
          They're off again. About fifty yards away, hidden behind the
          trees, is the SHACK. Something slips around the side of the
          structure. Stanley immediately spots what he thinks is
          Matthew.

                         STANLEY (CONT'D)
          Matthew!

                         ANDY
          He's in there all right.

                         STANLEY
          Good, cause he's coming out in pieces.
          Andy races ahead leaving Stanley trying to catch his breath
          behind him.

          81 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 81

          Andy enters. The shack appears as we first saw it, only now
          there are remnants of recent life.

                         ANDY
          Matthew! Where the fuck are you!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 77.
          Under the table is a pile of filthy old clothes. It almost
          looks like... a makeshift pillow.
          He picks up a moldy tin can which once contained some
          preserved meal. He tosses it to the ground.

          82 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 82 

          Stanley waddles out the back of the shack. He stops. About
          twenty yards away and sees JENNIFER leaning against a tree.

                         STANLEY
          Why you little bitch...
          Stanley races over - Just as Stanley gets close - SNAP!! A
          hidden BEAR TRAP clamps down on Stanley's leg - the pain is
          intense as he screams out - He staggers backwards and falls
          to the ground in agony

                         STANLEY (CONT'D)
          Oh, God! Oh, my fucking God!
          ON ANDY: As he exits the Shack to see Stanley on the ground
          writhing in pain.

                         STANLEY (CONT'D)
          Please! Andy! My fucking leg!
          Andy races over to assist him. As he offers Stanley his
          hand, he notices Stanley's eyes catching a glimpse of someone
          behind him. But as soon as he turns, the wooden BAT, the one
          from the fishing hole, catches him flush across the face!
          He's down and before Stanley knows it she cracks him in the
          back of the head.

                         TO BLACK:

          BACK IN ON:

          83 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 83

           Andy's eyes flicker open. He sees a hand wrapping a rusty 
           wire around the contact of an old car battery. Then he looks 
           up and sees a bare light bulb flicker on. 
          He's draped lengthwise over a horse trough so his torso is
          completely over the basin. His arms and legs are secured
          with ropes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 77A.
          Suddenly, the sound of RUSHING WATER from inside the trough.
          Andy looks down. A dirty hose hangs over the mouth of the
          trough. Brown water flows from it... Filling it.

                         ANDY

          Help! Somebody! Help me!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 78.
          His nose and face are busted - it hurts to scream.
          With the trough filling up quickly, Andy realizes it won't be
          long until the water is above his head.
          He cranes his neck upwards. After all, were he to stay face
          down, he would drown -- just like Jennifer would've.

          84 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE DAY 84

          STANLEY'S POV: It's Jennifer and in her hand is his video
          camera.

                         JENNIFER
          I know. You like to watch. Don't
          you. Don't you worry, I'll give 
          you quite a show.
          She sets the camera on top of a tri-pod right in front of his
          face, frames up and hits record. She looks up to him.
          Stanley's arms are tied behind a tree, his head is held in
          position, duct tapped back against the tree.
          His legs are anchored to the ground. The bloody mangled one
          still in the bear trap that bites and gnaws at his leg with
          every move.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Since you like to watch.
          She flips the monitor of the camera toward him just like he
          did to her.
          She stands in front of Stanley's face. Stanley wants to say
          something but his pain is too intense.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D) 
          Can't talk, can you? Well, maybe
          it's because you're hungry.
          Jennifer goes to grabs something behind her.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          You know, you have to eat some real
          nasty shit out here to stay alive.

                         STANLEY
          Bbbb... bitch! Let me go!
          She grabs his nose and pulls open his mouth shoving a MAGGOT
          INFESTED RODENT into his mouth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 79.

                         JENNIFER
          What's wrong, you don't like it? I
          prefer the maggots to the meat.
          Jennifer site down next to Stanley. She glances over to the
          monitor to see what he is looking at. Then she reaches over
          and into a burlap sack.
          Stanley stares straight ahead, at the monitor in front of
          him.
          Jennifer reaches into the burlap bag and takes out a roll of
          fishing line. Then she takes out a pack of fish hooks.
          Stanley's eyes go wide.
          Jennifer removes the hooks from their package. She holds one
          between her thumb and forefinger and studies the barbed tip.
          Smiling to herself, she threads the hooks with fishing line.

                         STANLEY
          Wh...what are you doing with that?

                         JENNIFER

                         (LAUGHS)
          Oh... just some fishing. I know
          how much you guys like to fish.
          Finally, when she's finished, she scurries behind Stanley's
          head. From behind him, she grabs his eyelid and pulls it
          away from the eyeball itself.

                         STANLEY
          What are you.. Please don't...
          Then she pops the hook through the lid and pulls the fishing
          line back over his head.
          Stanley screams something fierce as she continues to thread
          his eyelid open, slowly, methodically, delivering as much
          pain with every pull of the line, from one eye to the next.
          His eyeballs bulge unnaturally, twitching wildly--
          All Stanley can do is stare ahead and watch himself on the
          monitor.

                         JENNIFER
          I'll be back before you have a
          chance to blink.
          Jennifer stands up and brushes herself off and walks to--
          WITH ANDY: Jennifer comes over and slaps him in the head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 80.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          How ya' doing sport?

                         ANDY
          Please... please... I can't...

                         JENNIFER
          Please? I thought, no, I'm pretty
          sure you said something like
          this...
          Jennifer grabs a wad of his HAIR and SMASHES his face into

                         THE WATER-

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Suck it bitch.
          She pulls his head back up.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Does that ring any bells?
          Jennifer gets real close to his ear--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         SUCK--
          She slams his head back down and holds it - then up--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         IT--
          She slams his head back down again and holds it then up--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Bi tch.
          She holds his head down for a very long time as his body
          struggles - then up.
           Andy gasps for breath as Stanley's screams get louder--

                          JENNIFER (CONT'D)
           I think Stanley's calling me. I'll
           be right back. If you need me-
           She walks off-- 

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 81.
          BACK TO STANLEY: Both eyelids hooked open, blood and tears
          stream down his face, a gruesome sight.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Like the show so far?

                         (BEAT)
          Wait, it gets better.

                         STANLEY
          Please... Please... My eyes... I
          can't take it anymore... please...

                         JENNIFER
          Let me help you.
          Jennifer takes a slender knife from the bag. Working
          quickly, Jennifer guts a FISH.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Here, this might feel better.
          She leans in and smears the bloody fish guts onto Stanley's
          eyeballs.

                         STANLEY

          85 TNT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 85
          The water has filled up the trough and is overflowing. Andy
          struggles to lift his head up to draw a few quick breaths.
          Jennifer climbs onto his back and GRABS his hair pulling his
          head up.

                         JENNIFER
          Don't drown too soon.
          Andy tries to buck her off, gasping for breath, buckling
          under her added weight. Jennifer slams his head back into the
          water, and then up again... then down as she holds it.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Hold it... hold it... hold it...
          Then she pulls his head back up as Andy spits water all over.

                         ANDY

                         (CHOKING)
          Fuck you... fuck you...

                         JENNIFER
          Now is that any way to talk to a
          lady?
          And back down with his head - it is exhausting to watch.
          WITH STANLEY: As a single CROW shows up by his head.
          He tries to look at the bird to see what it is doing, but he
          can't move.
          ON THE MONITOR: The CROW has jumped onto Stanley's head -
          looking at his eyes -- It begins to peck at them. Stanley

          SCREAMS!

                         ON ANDY:
          Andy continues to struggle. A few seconds later, Jennifer
          returns, carrying a large bucket.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          I'm impressed. You got a lot of
          fight in you. Let's see how you do
          now.
          Jennifer brings forth the bucket.

                         ANDY
          Wha-- what is that?

                         JENNIFER
          oh, just some lye I found laying
          around.

                         ANDY
          Jesus, please, what the - no!
          Jennifer pours the lye into the bucket - the fumes make Andy
          gag. But he holds his neck up as long as he can - he does
          not want to put his face down.
          Jennifer come around in front of him.

                         JENNIFER
          Let's see how long you can keep
          that pretty little face of yours.
          Andy strains to keep his head faced at her.

                         ANDY
          Fuck you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 83.

                         JENNIFER
          You already did that. I didn't
          enjoy it much. Now it's my turn to
          fuck you.
          Andy's neck is straining to keep his head out.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          That's an awfully big head you got.
          Your neck must be getting tired.
          Every vein in his neck now bulges. Andy's eyes start to
          water with tears.

                         ANDY

                         (STRAINED)
          Please...

                         JENNIFER
          Andy?

                         ANDY
          Wh--what...

                         JENNIFER
          Fuck you.
          Andy's neck gives out dunking his head in the lye bath. He
          writhes with pain as he lifts it back out - BEET RED and

                         BURNING--

                         ANDY
          Ahhhhhhh!!!
          Jennifer laughs and walks out of the shack as Andy gasps,
          chokes and spits for his life as-
          STANLEY'S head is covered in crows.

          86 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 86

          The crows jump all over pecking at Stanley's eyes, his cheeks
          - he is a bloody mess as he lets out a final guttural scream!

          A86 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK A86

          Andy's body continues to writhe in pain. With yet another
          burst of strength he lifts his head out of the lye-bath
          revealing a face burnt red, puffy, oozing puss, skin flaking
          off and his eyes are a ghastly, milky white, pussy, and
          bloody.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 83A.
          Finally his body stops convulsing. His head and midsection
          drop into the water. Blood seeps up the surface from his
          mouth.

          B86 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY B86

          Stanley is dead. His one eye stares straight ahead. Where the
          other one should be, blood has poured all the way to the
          ground.

          C86 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY C86

          Andy is dead.

          EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - NIGHT

          The house is quiet now. A light bulb flickers from inside.

          B87 INT. SERVICE STATION - MORNING B87

          Johnny site at his desk, a phone planted to his ear.

                         JOHNNY
          .since when? Since last night...
          No Sheriff, I ain't heard from 'em.
          Johnny notices something in his small surveillance TV.
          ANGLE ON TV: A truck pulls up to the station, a hot woman in
          a skimpy outfit gets out of the truck. She pops the hood
          obscuring her once she does.
          Johnny sits up in his seat.

                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)
          Look, like I said, as soon as
          dipshit or fuckface show up or call
          in, I'll let you know. ASAP. Now I
          got a customer.
          Johnny hangs up and walks out of the station.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 84.

          87 EXT. SERVICE STATION - MORNING 87

          A truck is parked at the pump. Its hood is up and a woman
          leans over the engine. Her ass is perfectly framed in a
          tight miniskirt, from which two, long flawless legs descend
          into a pair of blood-red high heels.
          Johnny walks over to her, wiping his hands on his bandana as
          the woman shimmies her hips, almost inviting him to approach
          her. And Johnny, being Johnny, doesn't need much.
          Johnny is close enough to touch her. He snickers a bit,
          never taking his eyes off her ass.

                         JOHNNY
          Can I fill it up for you, ma'am?
          The woman wears sunglasses and slowly turns to Johnny.
          Johnny takes a long look from bottom to top - and when he
          gets to her face - it registers - but before he can do
          anything, Jennifer swings a tire iron and catches him right
          across the jaw.
          A handful of teeth, ejected by a spurt of fresh blood as
          Johnny falls face-first into the ground.

          88 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 88

          Johnny is buck-naked. His hands are tied tightly together
          and pulled above his head, running through an eye hook that
          has been screwed into one of the shack's wooden beams. His
          eyes flicker.
          Jennifer walks up to him, right to his face.

          JENNIFER (O.S.)
          It's date night.
          Johnny cranes his neck and twists his body to see who's there
          as Jennifer walks out of the shadows. She saunters up to
          Johnny.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Your mouth doesn't look so good.
          Maybe you should--
          With a massive TUG she pulls back on the bridle that bites
          into his raw, bloody mouth.

                         (SEDUCTIVELY)
          --Show me your teeth.

                         JOHNNY

                         FTHUCKKK YOU--
          He grunts out a hellacious scream as his body bucks wildly.

                         JENNIFER
          Oooh, you're an ornery stallion,
          aren't you?
          Jennifer tilts her head and looks at him, as you would a
          fascinating piece of art.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Guess I'm gonna have to tame you.

                         JOHNNY
          Bithh...
          With a bunch of teeth missing, Johnny's lisp is pronounced.
          Jennifer saunters around him seductively. She removes
          something from behind her back and brings forth a rusty pair
          of pliers.
          Jennifer steps closer.

                         JENNIFER
          Oh, that's the problem. You still
          have some teeth left. We're gonna
          have to fix that.
          Jennifer clamps the.pliers down tightly on Johnny's tooth.
          He tries to move but between the bridle cutting into his
          mouth and the pressure on the tooth, it's sheer agony.
          Jennifer jerks her hand from side to side, squeezing the
          tooth as hard as she can in the pliers. Finally, the root
          breaks free of the pulp and Johnny's tooth is extracted.
          Johnny flails around in severe agony.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Save your strength. You got a few
          more races to run.
          Johnny screams something unholy. Jennifer holds the tooth up
          in the air and inspects it.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          I have to admit, I didn't think it
          went that far down.
          Jennifer sticks the pliers in again, latching it onto another
          tooth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 86.
          Johnny's eyes bulge with fear as he kicks and screams pulling
          his shackles taut --
          Jennifer rips down on the pliers - her face is splattered
          with blood as the tooth comes free.
          Jennifer discards the tooth and goes right back--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         PLEATH--
          As Jennifer begins to extract yet another tooth, Johnny's
          weary body convulses in so much pain that he actually pisses
          himself.

                         JOHNNY
          Pleath...for the loth oth thod,

                         JENNIFER
          That's disgusting. Even your boys
          didn't piss themselves. Be a man,
          will you?!
          Jennifer takes the bridle and yanks Johnny's around, the pain
          is so bad he can hardly fight. He grimaces and spits out a
          mouthful of blood at her.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Now that's not gonna get you a
          sugar cube.

                         (BEAT)
          Aw... what's the matter Show Horse?
          I thought that's how you liked it?
          No teeth... right?

                         JOHNNY
          Justh kill me. Kill me you bith.

                         JENNIFER
          We'll get to that.
          Jennifer pulls out a gun.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)

                         (SING SONG)
          Look who's here. My boyfriend.
          Remember him?
          She takes the gun and caresses it across his face, his chin,
          and then she SHOVES it in and out of his mouth.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Give him a kiss.

                         (BEAT)
          Like you really mean it.
          Johnny finds renewed strength and starts to buck and writhe.
          ABOVE: The eye hook is starting to pull loose.
          With every touch of motion, white-hot pain courses through
          Johnny's body.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Breathe through your nose. It
          helps. You know, like it was your
          first time.
          Johnny's body flails with all his might as-
          ABOVE: The eye hook loosens a bit more--

                         JOHNNY

                         (SPITTING BLOOD)

                         WHORE--

                         JENNIFER
          I hear sometimes a stallion can get
          a little headstrong. They don't
          want to be trained... refuse to be
          broken...

                         (BEAT)
          But everyone has their breaking
          point, don't they?

                         (BEAT)
          You just have to find it. There's
          a way to break any animal. Do you
          know how they do that with horses?
          Do you, Johnny? I do.
          She walks away from Johnny and picks up the rusted old
          gardening sheer.
          She walks back to Johnny, menacingly slicing the sheer
          open... closed.. And again...

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          You slice off every ounce of their
          foul manhood.
          She slices it closed again.
          As Jennifer closes in, the look in Johnny's face says it all.
          But there is simply nothing he can do about it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 88.
          Jennifer gets even closer, looking at Johnny's eyes as she
          reaches down towards his penis--

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          You geld them.
          SLICE! - Johnny's eyes rolls back as he SCREAMS!!!!
          She holds the piece of limp, pink flesh in her hand.
          Despite everything he's been through, this brings forth an
          entirely new level of pain. He screams and bucks as the
          EYEHOOK continues to loosen.
          Jennifer bends down for a moment, bringing something up from
          the floor. She comes back to a screaming Johnny as she--

          SHOVES HIS CASTRATED PENIS INTO HIS MOUTH.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          No teeth show horse... no teeth.
          Johnny flails with all his might, screaming, spitting as--
          ABOVE: The eye hook finally gives way. Johnny's tied hands
          come crashing down directly on top of Jennifer.
          Jennifer goes flying with a bloody enraged Johnny now free as
          he grabs and claws after her.
          Jennifer desperately kicks and scratches to get away from
          this hideous, blood-soaked monster - but Johnny grabs hold
          onto her leg - he drags her closer as she loses her grip--
          With one solid kick, Jennifer connects with Johnny in the
          face - he sprawls out from pain - as she gets up and races
          out the door - Slamming it closed as she exits. She leans up
          against it holding it closed.

          89 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 89

          Within seconds the door is kicked at, banged at, punched at -
          Johnny screams wildly from inside as-- Jennifer holds it shut
          with all her strength.
          Slowly the cries and banging fade until there is nothing but
          silence.
          Slowly she slides down on her bottom... exhausted, spent and
          completely devoid of all emotion.

           HIGH ANGLE on Johnny. His lifeless body lays on the floor
           surrounded by a pool of blood.

          91 INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY 91

           Sheriff Storch drives through town. He scans each side of
           the street. His phone rings.
          He picks it up and answers it.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Hi, honey.

          MRS. STORCH
          What's wrong?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Nothing, why?

          92 INT. SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - DAY(INTERCUT W/ABOVE) 92


          MRS. STORCH
          Why? Because I can hear it in your
          voice, that's why.
          Sheriff Storch laughs. She knows him too well.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Long day, that's all.

          MRS. STORCH (ON SCREEN)
          Well, perk up. Chastity's new
          teacher is here.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Mrs. Novick?

          MRS. STORCH
          No, for the honors program. Do you
          remember anything?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Oh yeah, okay.

          MRS. STORCH
          Yeah, just moved here from the

          it's nice.

          Sheriff Storch GRUNTS. He doesn't find it so nice.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Well, I'll be home when I can.
          Busy today. if I don't make it,
          send her my regards.
          Sheriff Storch ends the call.
          Two seconds later the phone rings again. He looks at it,
          annoyed, answers.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          I said I'd be there as soon as --

                         CHASTITY
          Hey daddy! Where are you?

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (ANNOYED)
          I already told your mother,
          Chastity. I'm working. I'll do my
          best to get home.

                         CHASTITY
          But I really want you to meet my
          new teacher. She is way cool.
          Sheriff Storch rolls his eyes.

                         CHASTITY (CONT'D) 
          Here, just say hi. 
          Chastity hands the phone over to - JENNIFER HILLS - who is
          sitting comfortably on the sofa next to Chastity, her hand
          embracing the little girl. 

                          

                         JENNIFER
          Howdy, Sheriff.

          Sheriff Storch's face contorts upon hearing the name.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Excuse me?

                         JENNIFER
          I have to tell you, it's really
          been a pleasure meeting your
          family. You have a wonderful
          daughter with a bright and
          promising future.

          doing!--

          We'll see you soon, Sheriff.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          No - wait--
          But the call ends.

          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)
          Chastity! ... Chastity!
          Sheriff Storch throws the phone to the ground and slams on
          the gas.

          93 EXT. SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - DAY 93

          The squad car screeches to a stop right in front of Sheriff
          Storch's house.
          Hearing the commotion, Mrs. Storch walks out onto the porch.
          She's almost knocked to the ground as her husband comes
          barreling up the steps.

          MRS. STORCH
          What is --
          Sheriff Storch grabs his wife's shoulders.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Chastity, where is she?!
          Mrs. Storch has absolutely no idea what is going on. In her
          mind, their daughter couldn't be in better hands.

          MRS. STORCH (CONT'D)
          She wanted to get to know her
          students in the program before the
          year started.
          Sheriff Storch lets go of his wife.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Goddamnit!

          MRS. STORCH

                         (GROWING CONCERN)
          Who is she? Who is this woman?
          He turns and runs back to his squad car, gets inside, and
          pulls away even faster than he came.

          94 EXT. PARK - DAY 94

          The squad car skids to a stop on the grass of the park. It's
          a modest recreation area that has seen better days.
          Sheriff Storch jumps out of the car, still leaving it
          running, and sprints into the park.
          A few feet away, an empty swing blows gently in the breeze.
          The metal brackets screech loudly with every movement.
          Sheriff Storch spins around in circles, a maelstrom of
          confusion. He looks around frantically for anything that
          will give him a clue as to the whereabouts of his daughter.

          95 INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY 95 

          Sheriff Storch gets back inside. He immediately picks up the
          CB. But just as he opens his mouth to speak, lie glances in
          the rearview mirror. His eyes meet Jennifer's.
          Before he can turn, Jennifer pistol whips him in the temple.
          He falls forward, his head smacking into the steering wheel.
          The HONKING of the horn echoes throughout the empty park.

          96 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 96

          Sheriff Storch comes to. Blood trickles down from the side of
          his head.
          He's bent over the table, pants at his ankles. His SHOTGUN
          propped up behind him with the barrel inserted into his ass.
          With every move, a scorching pain courses through his body.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Ahhhhhh!
          Jennifer walks over to the table and rests her elbow on it.
          Sheriff Storch speaks through gritted teeth.

                         JENNIFER
          Does that hurt? Come on, I thought
          you were an ass man, Sheriff.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Where is she, you bitch?
          Jennifer slams the gun deeper. The Sheriff's body goes stiff.
          The Sheriff screams again.

                         JENNIFER
          I'd be careful how you speak to me
          at the moment, Sheriff. (BEAT)
          By "she," I assume you mean your
          daughter?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          What'd you do to her?

                         JENNIFER
          She really is lovely, Sheriff. So
          young. So sweet. I mean, can you
          imagine?

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Imagine what?

                         JENNIFER
          Imagine if someone had done this to
          her.
          Jennifer walks behind the Sheriff. She wraps her fingers
          around the barrel of the gun and shoves it in, deeper.
          The Sheriff's expression is one of unbridled agony. Jennifer
          continues to sodomize him with the shotgun.

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)
          Someone like Andy?

                         (HARDER)

          fuck.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 94.

          97 EXT. TOWN ROAD - DUSK 97

          Two squad cars, SIRENS BLARING, speed down the road.

          98 TNT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 98
          Jennifer as she takes a spool of fishing line and walks
          straight across the room.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (FRANTIC)
          Please, she's just an innocent girl.

                         JENNIFER
          So was I.
          She gets to the corner of the room where a hulking figure
          site tied up in a burlap sack. Jennifer removes it revealing
          a dead MATTHEW... or is he?
          She ties the line to Matthews wrist. The other end is tied
          onto the shotgun's trigger.

                         SHERIFF STORCH

                         (DESPERATE)
          You're not going to get away.

                         JENNIFER
          Neither are you.

          99 EXT. DIRT ROAD - DUSK 99

          The SQUAD CARS pull off and park as the DEPUTIES grab guns
          and race off into the woods.

          100 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 100

          Matthew stirs a bit as he starts to come to.

                         JENNIFER
          He'll be waking up soon. If I were
          you, I'd tell him not to move.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          (pained to talk)
          I'm begging you. Don't do this.
          We can figure something out.
          Matthew stirs again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

           ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 95.

                         JENNIFER
          Sorry, Sheriff...
          She leans in close to his face. 

                         JENNIFER (CONT'D) 
           "It was fun while it lasted". 

          101 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 101

          The Deputies converge on the SHACK, guns drawn.

          102 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 102

          Sheriff Storch tries to wriggle free - but every move he
          makes is the most painful experience imaginable.
          Matthew continues to stir awake, his eyes flutter open.

                         SHERIFF STORCH
          Matthew don't!--
          But it's too late - a startled Matthew jumps back--

                         MATTHEW
          --Sheriff!
          BANQ/// Matthew is splattered with blood, and body parts.

          103 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 103

          The Deputies react as the gun shot rings out through the
          area. They KICK the door in to see--

          104 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 104

          Matthew's crouched in a ball on the floor, covered in blood,
          the Sheriff, blood sprayed across the table, eyes wide open,

          DEAD.

          105 EXT. WOODS - DUSK 105

          Jennifer walks off as the sounds of the last remnants of the
          echoing gunshot fade into nothing. Jennifer doesn't miss a
          beat. She continues to walk off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 95A.

          106 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DUSK 106

          The cops drag a blood soaked Matthew out of the cabin. He is
          a disturbed, psychotic, babbling mess.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 96.

          A106 EXT. WOODS - DUSK A106

          Jennifer turns to the dilapidated shack. in the distance she
          sees the officers escorting a handcuffed Matthew out.
          SLOW MOTION: As Matthew is wildly kicking and screaming in a
          furious panic. The Officers try to subdue him.
          Jennifer just stares, devoid of emotion. Then, after a
          minute, she turns and continues to walk off into the woods.
          ON JENNIFER: As she continues to walk away - and then - as
          she continue closer to CAMERA - the smallest hint of a wry
          smile - nearly imperceptible, but it's there, creeps across
          her face.

                         SMASH OUT:
I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER

	FADE IN:

	TITLE SEQUENCE:

1	INT. BOSTON - OLD NORTH CHURCH - DAY

	The setting sun backlights a series of abstract colored images. Holy
	images of STAINED GLASS and lead.

	FOOTSTEPS ECHO across the marble floor.

	REVEAL - JULIE JAMES

	A little older, a little wiser, yet still very pretty, no doubt. But
	she's all alone in the house of the Lord.

	And those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden
	still rests upon her soul.

	She reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained
	CONFESSIONAL BOOTH.

2	INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - DAY

	Julie slides the drapes shut behind her as she enters, kneeling before
	the CLOSED SCREEN. A beat -- and the SCREEN SLIDES OPEN.

	A PRIEST

	enters the adjacent booth -- barely visible through the WICKER MESH.
	Julie looks down, crosses herself, and begins.

					JULIE
			Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
				(a beat)
			It's been a year since my last
			confession...

	Julie swallows hard. This is difficult for her.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			I've never told anyone this. Not my
			mom, not the poice, not even my
			friends -- except for the ones who
			were there and they...well they're
			not around anymore. You see I...I...

					PRIEST
			Yes?

					JULIE
			I killed a man. Well, I thought I
			had...then...

	She balks at the memory of it. The priest bows his head in the shadows
	of the other side.

					JULIE (cont'd)
				(emotional)
			You've got to understand...It was
			all an accident. A terrible accident.
			It's been a whole year. I've tried to
			get past this, but I just can't.

					PRIEST
			Go on...

					JULIE
			I have these dreams...horrible
			dreams. And this man is always there
			with me.

					PRIEST
				(reassuring)
			I know...

					JULIE
			You see, he was a killer. He
			murdered Helen and Barry, and he
			would have killed me too, if I
			hadn't...gotten away with it.
				(regathering)
			I don't know, I guess I just need to
			deal with the fear, the guilt...to
			finally say his name. Ben Willis. His
			name was Ben Willis...

	The confession is cathartic for Julie. She looks relieved until,

					PRIEST
			I know...

	Julie stops. Looks through the screen. A chill shoots through her
	body.

					JULIE
			You know? But how could you...

	Clouds of icy steam shoot through the partition. Julie moves closer to
	the screen, trying to get a better look.

					PRIEST
				(growls)
			I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!!!

	A STEEL HOOK

	smashes through the screen right in Julie's face! She SCREAMS!

									SMASH CUT TO:

3	INT. COLLEDGE LECTURE HALL - DAY

	Still screaming -- Julie jumps back, seemingly knocked out of her
	chair. She fights the unseen demon.

	Sitting beside her, Julie's friend WILL BENSON reacts. He's a good-
	looking kid in a shy, humble kind of way. And he tries to help her,
	but she's too busy turning ten shades of red.

	The PROFESSOR lowers his glasses, makes it even worse.

					PROFESSOR
			Nice to see you find Political
			Science so stimulating --

	The lecture hall erupts with laughter.

					JULIE
			I'm sorry --

	Julie grabs her stuff and bolts.

									CUT TO:

4	EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

	Julie explodes out of the building. Hurries down a sidewalk. Will
	finally catches up.

					WILL
			Julie! Wait! You okay?

					JULIE
			I'm fine.

					WILL
			You sure?

					JULIE
			I'm fine.

					WILL
			You don't seem fine.

	Julie realizes this is true.

					JULIE
			I had another dream, Will.

	Will takes this seriously.

					WILL
			The shower again?

					JULIE
			It was in a church...it was so real.
			I mean, I could feel his breath on me.

					WILL
				(caring)
			I'm sorry.

					JULIE
			I thought I was over the dreams for
			good. I really did. I hadn't had one
			for months.

					WILL
			It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna
			get better.

					JULIE
			It can't get worse. I mean, it's not
			like this was the first time I
			freaked out in class. I hardly ever
			get a full night's sleep, my grades
			suck, I'm this close from being thrown
			out of school.

	BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EXPLOSIONS. Julie jumps out of her skin. It's just
	STUDENTS letting off FIRECRACKERS as they fly past on bicycles.

	Will and Julie are now thinking the same thing.

					JULIE
				(cont'd)
			It was one year ago...

					WILL
			It's...the anniversary. That's what's
			going on...Take it easy on yourself.

					JULIE
				(weary)
			I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I
			don't even know why I came up here in
			the first place.

					WILL
				(cheering her up)
			To get out of Southport?

					JULIE
				(softens)
			Right. Now I remember.

	He smiles at her. She smiles back. They stop in front of her apartment
	building.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			Are you getting out of town on the
			fourth?

					WILL
			Nah. I'll probably just be here
			studying for finals. The joys of
			summer school...
				(beat)
			Are you okay?

					JULIE
			I'm okay.

					WILL
			Are you sure?

	She touches his face affectionately.

					JULIE
			Thanks for the talk, Will. You're
			good to me.

	Will stands there akwardly --

					WILL
			Um...Okay. Bye.

	Will walks away. Julie watches him a beat, then turns down her walk --

	RAY

	steps out of the shadows. Julie practically faints.

					JULIE
			Oh, my god, Ray. You scared me.

	Recovering, she hugs Ray, genuinely glad to see him. He's a bit cold.

					RAY
			I got in early. I was excited...
				(re: the receding Will)
			Who was that guy?

					JULIE
			Oh, that's Will. He's a friend.
			You'd like him.

					RAY
			Yeah.

					JULIE
			Ray, we're just friend.

					RAY
			Every guy in history who tried to
			pick up a girl did the good-friend
			thing first.

					JULIE
			Why are you being like this?

	It should be obvious Ray feels insecure in the college environs, but
	they're miscommunicating.

					RAY
			Hey, I'm sorry. You're right. Are
			you ready to go? I've got the old
			truck. You know the drill...Crab
			boil at Ollie's. Croaker Queen
			Pageant...It's only small-town fun,
			but it's still nice. People really
			miss you. I miss you.

	She looks at Ray, his compassionate demeanor. This is hard to say --

					JULIE
				(softly, but resolved)
			Ray, I can't...

					RAY
			Can't what?

					JULIE
			I just feel like some part of me
			hasn't healed up enough to go back.
			Like some critical piece is missing.
			Please understand...

	Ray is cold. This is what he's expected all along.

					RAY
			I understand something.

					JULIE
			It's not like that. It's not you.
			It's me. My head. I want to go back.
			I want to be with you. I want to be
			fine. I want everything to be like
			it used to be.
				(beat)
			It just isn't.

	Ray is hurt and confused.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			Hey, why don't you stay up here?
			They have fireworks over the river.
			And...there's a million things to do.

					RAY
			I have to work, Julie. My boat's in
			Southport, remember? But, I get it.
			You need your space from Craokerland.
			And maybe from me, too.

	Ray starts walking away.

					RAY (cont'd)
			You know where to find me.

					JULIE
			Ray? Ray? At least come up for a
			while.

	Ray keeps on walking.

					RAY
			It's okay. I'm just gonna go.

	Julie follows him out to the road. A group of LAUGHING STUDENTS block
	her way.

					JULIE
			Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
				(to herself)
			I'm just scared...that's all.

	But Ray is already gone. Julie stares after him a beat, then turns
	quickly to her door. She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the
	walk alone. She nervously pulls her keys. A can of mace dangles from
	the keychain.

									CUT TO:

5	EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY


	Students throw FRISBEE in the street. Ray walks to his old truck,
	which is wedged between a new Sport Utility and a BMW.

	He clambers into the front seat. He thinks. Then, digs into his pocket
	and pulls out the unmistakable shape of an ENGAGEMENT RING BOX. He
	throws it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away.

									CUT TO:

6	INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT DOORWAY - DAY

	Julie opens the door and steps inside. She locks three deadbolts. She
	stands there, alone, listening to the SILENCE. She doesn't even have a
	cat. A faucet DRIPS in the kitchen.

6A	INT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - DAY

	The faucet DRIPS. Julie turns the handle. No success. She checks the
	lock on each window. She stands for a moment.

	She picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. She opens the fridge
	and takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. She grabs a soft drink and
	a jar of bread-and-butter pickles. She gets some cookies from a shelf.
	She thinks. Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet.

	She takes the whole mess toward her bedroom.

6B	INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - DAY

	She hits the light switch. A bedside light goes on. It's a sparsely
	furnished room. The bed is pilled high with pillows. She checks the
	windows, then climbs into bed with the food.

	On the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. She looks at
	one of Helen and Barry. She looks around the room. It's depressing.

	Outside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going
	places. She picks at the food, then puts it on the table. She turns
	off the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the
	room.

									DISSOVE TO:

6C	INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Julie, sound asleep, is curled into fetal position on the bed.

	There's a CLICK in the front hall. And ANOTHER.

	Julie's eyes shoot open. She listens. Another SOUND, almost like the
	front door being CLOSED.

	Her arm reaches for the bedside light. She hits the switch. The bulb
	POPS.

					JULIE
				(whispers)
			Okay. Okay. Face your fears...

	She gets off the bed and stands still.

					JULIE (cont'd)
				(whisper)
			There's nothing...

	There's another NOISE down the hall.

					JULIE (cont'd)
				(whisper)
			Quiet.

	Julie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen.

6D	INT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

	She gets a large KNIFE. She listens. It sounds like somone's in the
	living room. She steps through the kitchen door.

	As she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway
	toward her bedroom.

6E	INT. JULIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	There's NO ONE there.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			Okay, calm down, imagination.

	She relaxes until she sees that her front door is slightly AJAR, light
	from the hallway slanting through.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			I can't take this anymore. I can't.

	Holding the knife in front of her, she tiptoes to the hallway. There's
	a soft RUSTLING coning from her bedroom. She gets a flashlight out of
	a drawer and starts down the hallway.

					JULIE (cont'd)
				(fatalistic)
			Let's just do it.

	She moves faster toward her bedroom. she listens outside the doorway.
	It sounds like someone's in the closet. She moves into the room.

6F	INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	There's a noise in the darkened closet. Julie moves into position.

	She turns the flashlight ON and lunges for the closet.

	INT THE CLOSET

	KARLA WILSON, 19, all grace and attitude, is on tiptoes reaching for a
	box of shoes. She SCREAMS.

	Julie SCREAMS. They both SCREAM together. Julie drops the knife and
	flashlight.

					KARLA
			I thought you were out of town!

					JULIE
			What are you doing in my closet?

	They hug, jumping up and down with relief.

					KARLA
			I thought you were out of town!

					JULIE
			What are you doing in my closet?

					KARLA
			i just wanted your black pants, but
			I'm not ready to die for them!

	Julie turns on the light in the hallway. Karla has her shoes in her
	hand and black pants draped over her arm.

					JULIE
			That was heart attack time, Karla.

					KARLA
			No. When I put these skinny pants on
			my body...Now, that's heart attack
			time.

	Karla looks down and sees the knife. She picks it up with two
	fingers --

					KARLA (cont'd)
			And we're going to put away the
			utensils and you're coming with me.

	Julie flops down on her bed.

					JULIE
			I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat,
			ugly, and depressed.

					KARLA
			Yeah, right -- whatever.

					JULIE
			I think I just really hurt Ray's
			feelings.

					KARLA
				(keeping it upbeat)
			Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great
			guy, nothing against old Ray, but
			he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in
			Southport. Will's a nice guy, too,
			and he lives right down the street.

	Karla picks up the flashlight and goes into the closet.

					JULIE
			There's nothing between Will and me.

					KARLA (V.O.)
			Yet. Nothing yet.

	She emerges with clothes for Julie. Holds up one outfit.

					KARLA (cont'd)
			What we gotta do is keep moving. No
			time to mope. I'm working at the
			club tonight. And you, dancing queen,
			are coming with me.

					JULIE
			No I'm not.

	Karla holds up another dress for Julie -- strapless, sexy, the one.

					KARLA
			Fine, then be fat, ugly, and
			depressed.

	Karla is dancing around. Julie laughs at her friend and takes the
	dress when Karla hands it to her.

									CUT TO:

7	INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

	It's a hopping college joint: crowded, loud MUSIC, a dance floor, and
	rivers of cheap booze.

	AT THE BAR

	Julie sits next to Karla as she waits for her drink order.

	A handsome young man slides in front of them. This is TYRELL MARTIN,
	23, handsome, no pretention, a little dangerous, with a killer smile.

					TYRELL
			You know what I want to do to you
			...right now, don't you? There's
			gotta be somewhere we can be alone.

					KARLA
				(playful)
			I don't think so. It's pretty
			crowded.

					TYRELL
			Just for a minute, baby. I got
			something I wanna tell you.

	He's looking for a dark corner or a storeroom or something.

					KARLA
				(teasing)
			If you can say all you gotta say
			in a minute then I don't wanna hear
			it.

					TYRELL
			I'll talk real slow.

	He's kissing her ear. She starts to giggle.

	The bartender sets down drinks on Karla's tray.

					KARLA
				(re: Julie)
			Ask her to dance.

	Tyrell hesitates.

					KARLA (cont'd)
			Go on.

	Karla cuts away through the crowd, delivering drinks. Tyrell turns to
	Julie.

					TYRELL
			You're the most beautiful woman
			in the bar tonight, Jules.

					JULIE
			Tyrell, you are an unstoppable
			force of nature.

					TYRELL
			That's right. It's how the species
			survives. You'll never convince me
			otherwise.
				(beat)
			Wanna dance?

	Karla passes by --

					KARLA
			Say yes.

					JULIE
			No.

					KARLA
			No means yes.

					JULIE
			Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have
			you seen my people dance? We make
			the mouth face, we move the
			fingers --

					TYRELL
				(heading for the floor)
			Worse comes to worse, you can stand
			there and watch me.

					KARLA
			Come on, I'll take a break and
			we'll all dance.

7A	INT. THE CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

	is packed and thumping. Karla is dancing her way through the crowd.
	Tyrell and Julie follow behind her.

	Karla sees Will. He's dressed up and nervous. She smiles.

					KARLA (cont'd)
			Whaddayou know? Will Benson lookin'
			fine.

					JULIE
				(suspicious, but
				having fun)
			Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?

					KARLA
			Nope. I told him that you
			absolutely, positively would not be
			here at this bar between ten o'clock
			and eleven o'clock tonight. And then
			he came anyway.

					WILL
				(shy to a fault)
			This was not my idea.

					JULIE
			What?

					WILL
			I said, this...Do you want a drink?

	Will looks down at his feet. He and Julie stand there not quite
	knowing what to do.

					TYRELL
			Where I come from, you want to
			snatch the goodies, you got to at
			least talk to them first.

	Tyrell and Karla go for it on the dance floor, leaving Will and Julie
	alone. They look at each other. They look at everyone dancing.

					WILL
			How about a drink?

	Will is a few steps ahead as they move for the bar. Julie seems to be
	relaxing, having a good time. Then, she looks up into the balcony and
	sees, in a strobe light's FLASH --

	SOMEONE IN A SLICKER

	watching her intently. She squints for a better look, but he's gone.

					WILL
				(yelling over the din)
			You okay?

	She's chalk white and crestfallen. Her whole affect is "Will I ever
	have a normal time?" She drifts amay toward the stairs to the balcony.

					WILL (cont'd)
			Hey Julie?

	Will catches Karla and Tyrell's eyes. They're worried.

7B	INT. THE CLUB - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

	Julie catches another glimps of THE SLICKER.

	She pushes her way through the crowd up the stairs.

7C	INT. THE CLUB - BALCONY - NIGHT

	Julie looks all around -- finally spotting the MAN IN THE SLICKER from
	behind, making his way to the other side.

	He slices through a crowd of students, and Julie keeps following. He
	turns down a service corridor.

	Julie follows, frightened, but unable to resist.

	She catches him at the end of the corridor. She reaches out and grabs
	the stranger's arm.

					JULIE
			Ben...

	The stranger turns around. It's only a club kid in a tacky vinyl
	raincoat and hat. She's shaken.

					SLICKER GUY
			Hye, baby. You following me up
			here?
				(a come-on)
			Well, all right.

	Julie turns away and hurries down the hallway. Todd follows, but his
	figure quickly fades.

									CUT TO:

8	INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	With morning sun filtering through her blinds, Julie wakes up to the
	strange sound of THUMPING. She gets out of bed and slowly exits the
	room.

8A	INT. JULIE'S HALLWAY TO KITCHEN - DAY

	The noise gets louder as she heads down the hall.

	ANGLE ON A CLOSET

	The noise is at its loudest -- Julie reaches for a doorknob -- and
	yanks open the door.

	ANGLE ON A CLOTHES DRYER

	rocking and banging inside the closet. Julie frowns.

	Julie spins, once again startled by Karla, who crosses to the dryer,
	flipping open the lid and then jumping back to catch the shoes as they
	pop out on the fly.

					JULIE
				(still sleepy)
			That could break the machine.

					KARLA
			Julie, people who end up making
			rules like that end up beating
			their kids with wire hangers. It's
			a fact.

	The phone RINGS. Karla looks at her watch.

					KARLA (cont'd)
			It's Tyrell.

					JULIE
				(resigned)
			The number's unlisted...

					KARLA
			Would you relax? We've been dating
			three months. He ain't stalking
			your butt.

					JULIE
			Okay, okay. You're right.

					KARLA
			I know it, and it feels good.
				(answering the phone)
			Hi, Ty.

	A DJ for a local radio station BOOMS from the phone.

					MARK (V.O.)
			This is Mark in the Morning for
			Magic 96.7 Radio Station! Who am I
			speaking with?

	Julie watches her friend get excited.

					KARLA
			Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh
			my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.
				(to Julie)
			Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.

					MARK (V.O.)
			Well, Karla, what're you doin' at
			home over the long fourth weekend?

					KARLA
			Well, I'm in school and --

					MARK (V.O.)
			How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7
			Quicky Getaway?

					KARLA
			Yes!

	Julie hits the SPEAKERPHONE BUTTON and Karla hangs up. The DJ's voice
	echos through the appartment.

					MARK (V.O.)
			Good, then I hope you remember your
			geography, Karla, because all you
			have to do to win is tell me the
			capital of Brazil.

	Karla's smile abruptly fades.

					KARLA
				(into phone)
			Brazil? Um...

	She looks to Julie, whose face is as blank as hers.

					KARLA (cont'd)
			You don't know?! You have to know.
			You know everything...

					MARK
			C'mon, Karla, one easy question,
			one great getaway!

					JULIE
				(shrugs)
			...South America...Carnival...

					MARK (V.O.)
			Karla, we need an answer. No
			looking it up.

					KARLA
			Still here...thinking...
				(stalling)
			You mean Brazil, the country?

					MARK (V.O.)
			Okay, Karla, five seconds.
				(counting down)
			Five...Four...

	Julie has an idea. She scramles for the kitchen. Grabs a BAG OF FRESH-
	GROUND COFFEE from the FREEZER.

					MARK (cont'd, V.O.)
			Three...Two...

	Julie tosses the bag across the room to Karla. Karla reads the label:
	RIO BLEND -- 100% BRAZILIAN COFFEE.

					KARLA
				(blurting)
			Rio de Janeiro!

					MARK (V.O.)
			Oh, no...Did you say Rio?

					KARLA
				(wincing)
			No. Yes?

	BELLS and WHISTLES and triumphant MUSIC.

					MARK (V.O.)
			You just won Magic 96.7's Quickie
			Getaway...a trip for four to Tower
			Bay Island in the fabulous Bahamas.

	Karla and Julie jump up and down ecstatically.

					KARLA
			Waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!

					MARK (V.O.)
			We'll call you back with all the
			details...So what's your favorite
			radio station?

					KARLA AND JULIE
			Magic 96.7!

	Julie hangs up and joins Karla dancing on the couch.

					KARLA
			I won. I won...I won, I won, I won.
				(teasing)
			Now, let's see...There's Tyrell,
			that's one. And, there's my parents
			...And I got some cousins.
				(beat)
			Okay, Julie, you can come, but Mark
			said four tickets. That means you
			gotta get yourself a date.

	Julie thinks, she seems torn.

									CUT TO:

9	EXT. SOUTHPORT DOCKS - DAY

	A SMALL MOUND OF RED SNAPPER is DUMPED -- wiggling and suffocating its
	way across the deck of a fishing boat.

	WE PULL AWAY TO REVEAL it's RAY who's just done the dumping. A
	coworker, DAVE, friendly, playful, and down-to-earth, calls out from
	the dock --

					DAVE
			Hey, Ray...phone!

	Ray takes the phone.

	WE INTERCUT.

					JULIE
			Hi.

	Ray is happy to hear her voice, but cautious.

					RAY
				(beat)
			Hey. I'm really glad you called...
			I'm sorry.

					JULIE
				(compassoinate)
			No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm
			the one --

					RAY
			No, I shouldn't have left so fast...
			I was just...

					JULIE
			It's okay.

	Dave holds up two wriggling snappers. He dances them toward each other
	in a puppetlike mating ritual, making KISSING SOUNDS and narrating --

					DAVE
				(as the fish)
			Julie, I love you. I know I'm only a
			humble fish, but if you really look
			at it, you're a fish, too.
				(girl voice)
			Oh, Ray, you're right...Do me like a
			snapper.
				(mashing the fish together)
			Hey, something smells like fish...

	Ray waves him away, concentrating on his call.

					JULIE
			Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas!
			An island called Tower Bay. And she
			wants us to come with her.

					RAY
			What? The Bahamas? You're kidding.

	Dave's interest is piqued.

					JULIE
			We'd have a long weekend just to sit
			in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and
			swim, and...
				(sexy)
			You know...

					RAY
			This weekend?

	Dave is watching Ray closely. Ray's expression hardens.

					RAY
				(hurt)
			You'll go away with you're college
			friends, but you won't go away with
			me?

					DAVE
			Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.

	Karla is watching Julie.

					JULIE
			It's not you, it's Southport. And
			it's the Bahamas! And it's free!

	Karla is watching Julie.

					KARLA
			You gotta sell his butt on the
			Bahamas?

					JULIE
			Ray, come on. I want us to be
			together.

	Ray thinks. Dave looks at him like he's crazy.

					RAY
				(can't give in)
			Julie, we're working a big run up
			here. It's been crazy. We probably
			have to go out again tonight. I
			don't think I can do it.

					JULIE
			Will you try...for me, please?

	Dave moves one of the fish like it's been shot through the heart.

					RAY
			Okay, I'll try. But, listen...
				(martyrlike)
			If I don't make it up, then you go
			ahead and have a great time.

					JULIE
			Ray...please try. I really miss you.
				(beat)
			Okay. Bye.

	She hangs up and Karla sits next to her.

					KARLA
			That boy has got fish on the brain.
				(sensitive)
			Hey, cheer up, Charlie.
				(singing a rumba)
			We're going to the Bahamas. Bahama
			Mama, yeah...

10	EXT. SOUTHPORT DOCKS - DAY

	Ray is staring unhappily at the little pile of snapper. Dave is
	staring at him in disbelief.

					DAVE
			Man, what is your problem? We
			haven't caught anything for days.
			Pull the big ugly stick out of
			your butt. She asked you to go to
			the Bahamas! Man, you gotta go.
			We'll both drive up. I got friends
			I can see up there.

	Ray realizes how right he is.

					RAY
			Stupid. Stupid.

					DAVE
			Stupid. What were you thinkng?

	Ray looks at Dave a contemplative beat, then walks over to his truck.
	He leans in the passenger side and pulls out the engagement ring box.
	Dave walks over.

					RAY
			You wanna see what I've been
			thinking?

	He holds up the box and slowly opens it. Dave is stunned.

					DAVE
			Jeez, Ray, fourth and forty, throw
			the bomb.

					RAY
			I should go up there. I should call
			her back, tell her I'm coming.

					DAVE
			No way, man. Surprise her. She'll be
			psyched.

	Ray is excited by the plan and Dave's right there with him.

									DISSOLVE TO:

11	EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	We stare out at a rain-soaked stretch of road.

	A PICKUP ROARS past, cruising along with its RADIO loud and windows
	rolled down.

12	INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT

	The music's even LOUDER in here. The mood is high...Two buddies going
	to propose to a girl. Dave adjusts the radio to another AM station --

					DAVE
			Man, I love AM radio. You got
			right-wing conspiracy, tips for
			pregnant womem, Single-A baseball
			games, and real country music...
			None of that new crap...

	He adjusts the dial again, tuning in a country song, "MAMAS, DON'T LET
	YOUR BABIES GROW UP TO BE COWBOYS," by Waylon Jennings and Willie
	Nelson.

	Dave starts singing along, extra LOUD and out of tune.

					DAVE (cont'd)
				(singing)
			"...Mamas, don't let your babies grow
			up to be cowboys, don't let 'em pick
			guitars and drive them old trucks. Let
			'em be doctors and lawyers and such."

	Ray looks at his goofy friend singing and starts to get a little happy
	himself...

	Then, Ray sees something in the road ahead. He turns down the radio.
	They both stare --

	RAY'S POV: A CAR TURNED SIDEWAYS

	its HAZARDS blinking.

	Ray slows and creeps past the car. The driver's door is open. It
	appears EMPTY.

	A BODY

	is sprawled out in the road away from the car. Ray pulls over to the
	shoulder and stops.

					DAVE
				(nervous)
			I don't know, man. Maybe we should
			keep going, find a phone --

					RAY
			No.

					DAVE
			The guy looks dead.

	Ray has seen this before --

					RAY
			Maybe not.

	He throws open his door.

12A	EXT. ROADWAY - NIGHT

	Ray steps from his truck. Looks back at the empty car, then turns
	toward the body.

					RAY
				(nervous)
			Hey! Buddy, what's up?

	The body doesn't move.

	BEHIND RAY

	and behind Dave, in the other car, a FIGURE IN A SLICKER sits up in
	the back seat and gets out of the car.

	Ray continues toward the body.

	RAYS POV - BODY

	FACE DOWN -- WEARING A BLACK RAIN SLICKER.

	Ray moves closer to the all to familiar image.

	BEHIND RAY

	SLICKER FIGURE moves toward the unsuspecting Dave.

12B	INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT

	Dave watches Ray in the road. He leans across the seat and rolls up
	Ray's window.

	Behind him, the SLICKER FIGURE gets closer, moving to the passenger
	side of the truck.

12C	EXT. MEDIAN - NIGHT

	Ray nears the body. He kneels down.

					RAY
			Hey, can you hear me?

	Ray reaches toward the body...

12D	INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT

	Something FLASHES IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRROR.

12E	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

	Ray turns over the body. Something isn't right. Ray jumps back --

	CLOSE - SLICKER MANNEQUIN

	Its eerie smile mocking Ray who turns for the truck.

					RAY
			DAVE!

12F	EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT

	Dave hears something. He turns to late. SPLLAATTT!!! THE FISHERMAN
	jams his hook through Dave's jaw and skull and YANKS DAVE OUT OF THE
	CAR WINDOW.

					RAY
			...Dave?

	There's no answer from dead Dave. Ray tries to see around the
	headlights. He moves slowly toward the truck.

	The BRIGHTS and FOGS come on, blinding Ray. The truck's engine REVS.
	The truck rolls a few inches, adjusting a bead on Ray.

	Then, tires spinning, the truck launches straight at Ray.

	Ray runs at the truck. AT THE LAST MINUTE, he ducks behind the parked
	car.

	HIS TRUCK goes SCREAMING past.

	Ray backs around the car --

	AN EIGHTEEN-WHEELER

	goes barreling by in the other direction. Ray dives out of the way.

	IN THE ROAD

	Ray is exposed. He sees his truck closing fast. He's got nowhere to
	go. Then, at the very last second,

	RAY

	jumps off the edge of the road. His TRUCK SLAMS INTO THE BARRIER RIGHT
	WHERE RAY WAS STANDING. SPARKS FLY! METAL BUCKLES!

	Ray falls through the air. Lands hard on his leg. Tumbles down the
	hill, finally stopping with a crash. He lies motionless at the bottom
	of a ravine.

									FADE OUT:

13	EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Karla exits the building. She watches Julie sitting on the curb.

	A truck turns onto the street. Julie looks hopeful, but -- it's not
	Ray.

	Karla approaches her friend.

					KARLA
			Girl, it's gettin' down to the wire.

	Julie turns.

					JULIE
			He's not coming. I thought he was
			just...

					KARLA
			Julie, you left four messages...
			Four.

					JULIE
			But, he said he'd try.

					KARLA
			He said he'd try. Try is like maybe.
			Try is nothing!

					JULIE
				(appoligizing for him)
			He does work hard.

					KARLA
			Work hard, huh? He's breaking your
			heart just because he can.
				(hesitant)
			And I don't want to have to say I
			told you so...

					JULIE
			Then, don't.

	A Jeep Cherokee stops, and an ebullient Tyrell steps out wearing
	shorts and a Hawaiian shirt.

					TYRELL
			Hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or
			we gonna get tropical?

	The passenger door opens and Will Benson steps hesitantly around the
	Jeep.

					JULIE
			Oh!

					KARLA
				(re: Will)
			Hey, sorry...
				(quick, playing it off)
			He's my friend, too. And that ticket
			is not going to waste.

	Will reads Julie's expression.

					WILL
			Julie, is everything cool? Karla
			said...

					KARLA
			I said we start having fun. And that
			means now.

	Julie takes a last look up the street. She stands.

					TYRELL
			Is there a problem here?

					KARLA
			Where there's a Will, there's a
			way. Come on.

					JULIE
				(deciding)
			You know what? This rocks. We're
			going to the Bahamas!

	Will is relieved.

					KARLA
				(getting into the spirit)
			We goin' Bahamas, I'm Ty's Bahama
			Mama. We goin' Bahamas...

	She bops over to Tyrell.

									CUT TO:

14	EXT. MIDAIR - DAY

	A wide-body jet SCREAMS through the clouds.

15	INT. PLANE - DAY

	A nearly empty jet. Karla has her head on Tyrell's shoulder. Julie is
	reading a book.

	Will's knuckles are white from gripping the armrests in fear, and his
	eyes are clenched shut. Julie looks on with concern.

					JULIE
			Just take deep breaths and think of
			something happy from childhood.

					WILL
			What if I don't have anything happy
			from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax
			going five hundred miles an hour, or
			four thousand, four hundred feet a
			minute...
				(calculating)
			Which is over seven hundred feet a
			second. Imagine hitting something at
			seven hundred feet a second.

					JULIE
			Deep breaths --

					WILL
				(no deep breaths)
			Fumes build up in the fuel tanks.
			You can by surface-to-air missiles
			over the internet. Planes use
			O-rings...which freeze in tap water.
			Planes fall from the sky for
			practically no reason at all.

					JULIE
			You've got a better chance of
			getting hit by lightning.

					WILL
			Right. Planes get hit by lightning.
			They get hit by meteors. They hit
			other planes.

	Tyrell shakes his head.

					TYRELL
				(exasperated)
			Something is gonna hit your butt if
			you don't quit complaining.

					KARLA
				(sypathetic)
			Honey, some folks just can't fly.

	Will doesn't move, frozen with fear of flying, but more closely bonded
	with the concerned Julie.

									CUT TO:

16	EXT. OCEAN VISTA - DAY

	Establishing. A Board of Tourism kind of shot. Blue water. Green
	islands. Golden sun. Puffy clouds.

	A BOAT CHUGS by with the words "Tower Bay" painted on the side.

	Tyrell THROWS UP over the side.

17	EXT. FERRY - DAY

	More of a small tub than a ferry. Julie, Karla, Will, and Tyrell are
	the only passengers.

	At the bow, Julie and Karla laugh and play "King of the World." Julie
	in the prow, Karla behind her.

					JULIE
				(deadpan)
			I'm the King of the World.

					KARLA
				(deadpan)
			No, I'm the King of the World.

	They switch places. They look at each other and crack up laughing.
	Karla takes in the surroundings, the salt spray, the day --

					KARLA
			Remind me to study real hard so
			someday this is normal and all that
			back there is somethin' I do for a
			weekend once every ten years.

					JULIE
				(sharing the moment)
			I will, and you remind me of the same
			thing.

	They throws their arms around each other and stare into the horizon.

	AT THE STERN

	Will talks to a very green Tyrell.

					WILL
			You just gotta breathe.

	Tyrell is trying to keep from puking --

					TYRELL
			Can't talk right now.

					WILL
				(slightly malicious)
			See, it's not a macho thing. It's
			about equilibrium in your inner ear.
			You could've used a patch, but it's
			too late now. Get used to it.
				(then)
			Some folks just can't sail.

	PAULSEN, the BOAT CAPTAIN, overhears as he passes --

					PAULSEN
			That's too bad, too, because it's the
			only way on or off the island.
				(slightly ominous)
			Unless you have an accident. And then
			they call the Coast Guard.

	Julie and Karla have rejoined the men.

					JULIE
			It's pretty remote here.

					PAULSEN
				(smiles)
			Yep. That's what the tourists pay for
			-- sun, sea, and solitude.

					TYRELL
			Are we there yet?

					PAULSEN
			Few more minutes.

	We move off the boat and REVEAL the island. The intrepid vacationers
	excitedly take in the island.

									CUT TO:

18	EXT. TOWER BAY - DAY

	Establishing. An isolated tropical paradise with jungle growing to the
	beach.

19	EXT. RESORT DOCK - DAY

	The ferry pulls in to a canopied dock. A white-sand beach stretches in
	every direction. Beautiful tourists stroll about without a care in the
	world.

	Tyrell stamps his feet on the dock.

					TYRELL
			I feel like I'm still on that thing.

	A dockhand, DERRICK, glides past him toward the ladies.

					DERRICK
			That way for a complimentary Planter's
			Punch to get you readjusted.

					TYRELL
				(mile-wide smile)
			I can get used to this.

	Derrick reaches for Julie's hand, clearly checking her out in the
	process.

					DERRICK
			Welcome, Fair Princess, to Tower Bay.
				(a wink)
			I'm Derrick. At your service for the
			duration of your stay.

	Julie smiles politely. Will gently nudges her on. They walk away.

					PAULSEN
				(to Derrick, mocking)
			I'm at your service, Princess.

					DERRICK
				(shrugs)
			Season's over old man. So I gotta
			work fast.

					PAULSEN
			If Marine Radio's right about the
			weather, you're already out of time.

	He hangs a SIGN at the end of the gangplank. It reads: LAST DEPARTING
	FERRY -- LINE FORMS HERE.

	Our guys are already at the end of the dock.

									CUT TO:

20	EXT. TOWER BAY HOTEL - DAY

	Establishing. An opulent, Carribean-style hacienda resort with all the
	accoutrements.

	The main building is two stories high with a tiled roof. A bell tower
	rises from one side. And, of course, it is surounded on all sides by
	suffocating fooliage.

	Julie and Karla take in the beauty of the resort.

					KARLA
			Check it out.

	TOW BIKINI GIRLS

	catch the eyes of Tyrell and Will.

					TYRELL
			Yes, ma'am.

	Karla THWACKS him on the back of the head, but they're all having fun.

	The path widens. The trees part. It's even nicer up close. They walk
	across a tiled plaza.

	Behind them, THREE YOUNG GUYS carry their GIRLFRIENDS piggyback,
	racing each other toward the departure dock.

	Our two arriving couples move on toward the entrace, passing a FENCED
	TENNIS COURT on the left. A GLASS-PANED ORCHID HOUSE straight ahead.
	And, on the right,

	A LUSH POOL with a built-in JACUZZI in the shallow end. An outdoor
	THATCHED ROOF BAR stands nearby -- and just beyonk it, a small POOL
	HOUSE.

	A guy's unintelligible RASTA VOICE calls out --

					RASTA VOICE
			Anybudorsomethin'?

	They turn to see TITUS, white guy, dreads, full-Rasta demeanor. He's a
	phony, but sincere about it.

	Titus approaches Tyrell --

					TITUS
			My brother, can I interest you in the
			islands finest ganja?

					WILL
				(teasing)
			Hey, Tyrell, we found you brother.

					TYRELL
				(wry)
			Not possible.

					TITUS
				(undetered)
			Who be wantin' the kind, the uber-
			sticky, the Bwana, The depth-charge,
			the Up-All-Night-Laughing-With-Your-
			Friends? Who wants it? 'Cause Titus got
			it.

					WILL
			No, thanks.

					TITUS
			Come on, man. Everybody wants something.

	Will and Tyrell walk on. Undetered, Titus goes up to Karla and Julie.

					TITUS (cont'd)
			How 'bout you, ladies? Lovely ladies.

	Titus moves his hips.

					TITUS (cont'd)
				(lascivious)
			Something I can do for you?

	Karla looks him up and down, wrinkles her nose --

					KARLA
			Take a bath, maybe.

					TITUS
			That's cold, but if that's how you
			want it.

	The group moves on. Titus watches them go --

					TITUS (cont'd)
				(yelling after them)
			Anybudorsomethin' you come and see me.

	OMIT SCENE 21 & SCENE 22

									CUT TO:

A23	EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY

	Around TWENTY TO THIRTY GUESTS ARE ON THEIR WAY OUT as Julie and the
	others walk in. Julie smiles at an old PORTER helping the departing
	guests with their bags. He doesn't smile back.

23	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

	The hotel is tastefully appointed with island decor. AN ORNATE METAL
	STAIRCASE leads UP to the ROOMS -- and DOWN (AS THE SIGN SAYS) TO A
	FITNESS CENTER.

	In one direction, the foyer meets the entrance to a tropical
	RESTAURANT/BAR. And in the other, A LOOBY LOUNGE is visible --
	surrounded by four walls of BOOKS and HOTEL MEMORABILIA.

	In a dark corner of the room, a uniformed MAID named OLGA dusts off a
	massive WOODEN GLOBE.

	Julie smiles at the woman on their way through the lobby, but Olga
	shyly looks away.

	Arriving at the FRONT DESK, the four of them find it deserted. They
	wait patiently, then impatiently.

	ANGLE ON A DESK BELL

	as Karla slaps it with her palm. The bell RINGS for a long time then
	fades into SILENCE.

					KARLA
			Hello? Hello?

					JULIE
			Where is everyone? I'll ask --

	Julie turns to consult the maid.

	ANGLE ON THE GLOBE

	The big ball is spinning. But Olga is no longer in sight.

	Tyrell heads toward a DOOR beside the counter with a sign which reads:
	PRIVATE OFFICE.

					TYRELL
			I'll scare somebody up.

	He grabs the knob and pulls the door open to...

	RROWWWR? A PIT BULL ON A CHAIN JUMPS UP INTO HIS FACE -- its toothy
	maw snapping shut about a half inch from his nose.

					TYRELL (cont'd)
			Whoa!

	Julie and Karla laugh. Karla goes to hit the bell once more -- ONLY TO
	HAVE HER HAND GRABBED IN THE PROCESS.

	Karla gasps. Pulls away. We see the hand belongs to the hotel manager
	-- BROOKS, balding, 40s, talks slowly, and seems to have secrets he
	won't share with guests.

					BROOKS
			What can I do for you?

					KARLA
			Checking in...Karla Wilson.

	Will saunters away to look at the books in the lobby.

					BROOKS
				(condescending)
			Ah, yes. Roll out the red carpet.
			Our contest winners are here at
			last.

	He scans a sheet as Tyrell stares at the pit bull.

					TYRELL
			Nice dog.

					BROOKS
			Not really. I've found peices of
			guys like you in his stool.

	Tyrell is put off by this aggressive comment.

					TYRELL
			What's your problem, buddy?

					BROOKS
				(innocent)
			I don't have a problem in the world.

					JULIE
				(covering)
			It sure is a beautiful old hotel.

					BROOKS
				(proud)
			Built in 1948 for a member of the
			Rockefeller clan. The tile work was
			imported from Spain. A lot of history
			in these walls...Judy Garland stayed
			here...Hemmingway fished for marlin
			right off that dock --

					TYRELL
			Okay, we get it...It's old.

					BROOKS
			It'll outlive you, I'm sure.

	Creepy thing to say. Slides a registration form.

					BROOKS (cont'd)
			Wilson comma Karla...
				(sees something on
				the form)
			Oh --

					KARLA
			Oh, what?

	Brooks covers --

					BROOKS
			You're in 201 and 202.

					KARLA
				(expecting this)
			Is that bad?

					BROOKS
				(lying)
			Not at all. Those are our honeymoon
			suites.

	Tyrell wraps his arms around Karla. Julie looks uncomfortably towards
	Will.

					JULIE
			Your what?

					BROOKS
			Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids
			haven't exchanged vows, yet?

					JULIE
			We haven't exchanged anything.

					KARLA
			Julie, we're talkin' suites!
				(excited)
			That'll be just fine with us.

					BROOKS
			And, while you're here, our marginally
			trained, off-season staff of five will
			attend to your every need.

					KARLA
			Wait...Did you say off-season?

					BROOKS
			July fourth weekend. Storm season
			starts today. The clouds roll in like
			clockwork.

					JULIE
			Storm season?

					BROOKS
			It's our version of winter.
				(hands over the keys)
			201 and 202. There's Scrabble and
			Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.

	And Brooks turns away through the office door. They walk toward their
	rooms. Will catches up with them.

									CUT TO:

24	INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

	They walk down the hallway. Karla seems annoyed.

					KARLA
			Ain't nothin' free in this world.
			Everybody says it, and it's true.
				(dissapointed)
			I wanted you all to have a good trip.

					TYRELL
			We will, baby...All this means is we
			got the whole island to ourselves.

					WILL
			And it's been blue skies all day. It
			might be perfect all weekend.

					JULIE
			It beets being on the mainland.

					KARLA
			Oooh, the mainland --

					TYRELL
			Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby.
			Tropical!

	The mood is improving. A SQUEEKING NOISE interupts.

	A BRASS LUGGAGE CART has appeared behind them. And ESTES, 60s, the
	weary Haitian porter, steps from behind it.

					ESTES
				(a Carribean accent)
			201 and 202...Who put you in...?
				(hesitant)
			Don't use these much --

					JULIE
				(suspicious)
			Why's that?

	He sees their happy, expectant faces and changes the subject.

					ESTES
			No real reason.
				(then)
			Pretty fancy rooms for kids your age.

					KARLA
			We won a competition.

					ESTES
			Oh, yeah? What you have to do?

					TYRELL
			Guess the capital of Brazil --

					KARLA
			Rio, baby!

					ESTES
			Ahh, good for you, girl.
				(waiting for a cue)
			...And, where would you like me to
			put the bags?

	A beat as Julie and Karla exchange a look. Then, Karla tosses one of
	the keys to Julie.

					KARLA
				(to Estes)
			Their stuff in there...
				(grabbing Tyrell)
			...and ours in here.

					JULIE
			Karla! You promised.

					KARLA
				(looking at Tyrell)
			I also promised Tyrell.

					TYRELL
			Promised me what, baby?
				(joking around)
			I made all my promises to William.

	Tyrell makes fake goo-goo eyes at Will. Estes looks away.

					TYRELL (cont'd)
			Sweetie, you brought your nightie,
			didn't you?

					WILL
			Forward! A girl needs time to make up
			his mind.
				(to Julie, thoughtful)
			Julie, look, if it's cool, I'll sleep
			on the couch and they can have their
			own room to practice for that real
			honeymoon.

	But Tyrell grabs Karla and drags her into the room. We here GIGGLES.

					WILL
			I'll take those.

					ESTES
			No, I've been doing this since before
			you were a dream in your father's eye.

	Estes grabs the bags and takes them into the room. Julie and Will are
	left staring at each other.

					WILL
			You sure it's okay with you?

					JULIE
				(noting his sweetness)
			Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't
			snore.

					WILL
			You can toss a shoe at me if it gets
			out of hand.

	She laughs and they go into the room.

									CUT TO:

25	INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

	BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. Ray is hooked up to a heart monitor. Although he's
	asleep, we can tell he's bruised and generally beaten up.

	WE RACK to a DOCTOR checking on him through the glass.

25A	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	We see a COP next to the doctor.

					COP
			He's beaten up pretty bad --

					DOCTOR
			Yes, but he seemed certain his friend
			was killed out on the highway by
			somebody named Ben Willis.
				(hisitant)
			He said he has a hook on his hand. He
			said he was driving a BMW.

	As the cop stares at him deadpan, the doctor realizes how rediculous
	this must sound.

25B	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	CLOSE UP: Ray's eyes pop open. He's listening.

26	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

	The cop explains things to the doctor.

					COP
			There's no body. And there was no
			other vehical involved.
				(beat)
			He fell asleep at the wheel...and ran
			his old truck into a guardrail. He got
			thrown way the hell down into a ditch.
			He's damn lucky.

	They walk back down the ICU.

					DOCTOR
				(nodding)
			He suffered a severe head trauma --

					COP
			Probably once he rests up, it'll all
			come back to him.

	The doctor and cop approach the nurse's station. The NURSE is reading
	a magazine. She folds it away.

	Suddenly, the monitoring equpment goes OFF with a series of LOUD
	WARNINGS.

					NURSE
				(already moving)
			That's your number twelve --

	The doctor, nurse, and country cop hurry back toward Ray's room.

					NURSE (cont'd)
				(yelling)
			Get me some help down here. We got a
			flatline, room twelve.

	THEIR POV - THROUGHT THE DOOR

	The wires and monitors are unhooked and Ray is GONE.

									CUT TO:

27	INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

	A resort bar on the beach. Ocean breezes and surf SOUNDS come through
	the window.

	It's tiki galore, complete with a bamboo bar and fishing gear hanging
	from decorative nets from the ceiling. There's a KARAOKE STAGE in the
	corner.

	Will and Tyrell enter and head straight to the bar. A bored bar
	tender, NANCY, looks just like Jennifer Esposito, doesn't look up from
	her paperback.

					NANCY
			You guys lost?

					TYRELL
				(re: the emptiness)
			Tell me this ain't the bar scene.

					NANCY
			Wanna drink?

					WILL
			We didn't get all dressed up for
			nothing.

					TYRELL
			Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or
			how about a Mai-Tai?

					NANCY
			How about some ID?

	They freeze.

					NANCY (cont'd)
			Kidding.

	They nod.

					WILL
			The guy at the desk said the place would
			be quiet, not dead.

					NANCY
			Didn't anyone tell you this is --

					TYRELL
			The last day of the season. Yeah, we
			heard.

					WILL
			So why are you still here?

					NANCY
			That's none of your business.

	Tyrell sizes her up quickly.

					TYRELL
			What's the matter, boy trouble?

					NANCY
			Not anymore.

					TYRELL
			He leave you?

					NANCY
			No. I shot him.

	Will and Tyrell exchange a danger-Will-Robinson glance.

					NANCY (cont'd)
			What you want is a Dark and Stormy:
			Vernon's rum, ginger beer, and a touch
			of Tabasco. Sailors drink it for luck
			in the hurricane season, trust me.

	ACROSS THE BAR

	Karla and Julie walk in talking quietly to one another.

					JULIE
			Am I bad? I mean, he's really great,
			and he's cute --

					KARLA
			He's cute...And he's got a crush on
			you...
				(off Julie's look)
			But...

					JULIE
				(appologetic)
			I miss Ray...I tried to call him.

	Karla looks at her. She's sincere, but firm.

					KARLA
			Ray made up his own mind...so, you're
			free to make up yours.

	Joining the men, but continuing her thought --

					KARLA (cont'd)
			For the next foury-eight hours...
				(joking)
			Your smile is a frown...turned upside
			down.

	She illustrates with her own big smile.

					TYRELL
			Pretty cool bar.

					KARLA
			They all start to look the same once
			you've worked in one.
				(to Nancy)
			Am I right, sister?

	Nancy reaches out a hand and they touch just the tips of their
	fingers.

					JULIE
				(to Nancy)
			I'm Julie. This is Karla.

					NANCY
			Nancy.
				(sarcastic)
			Welcome to Tower Bay's most happenin'
			hotspot.

	Nancy continues making their cocktails.

	JULIE

	backs into something, turns and gasps -- it's a statue of an OLD
	WHALER, complete with HARPOON, WHITE BEARD, and YELLOW SLICKER.

	She doesn't let Karla see that it upset her.

	Nancy puts their drinks down in front of them.

					NANCY
			Four Dark and Stormies...

	They all pick up their drinks.

					KARLA
				(toasting)
			To a great weekend --

					WILL
			Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the
			weather!

					KARLA & JULIE
			I'll drink to that!

	They drink and toast again.

					KARLA
				(to Nancy)
			So what do you do around here for fun?

	Nancy looks straight at Will --

					NANCY
			Make fun of tourists mainly.
				(beat)
			Or let them make fun of themselves...

	She flips a switch that lights the Karaoke stage.

					KARLA
			Karaoke -- perfect.

					JULIE
			Don't even think about it.

					KARLA
			Okay, I won't.

	She's already heading for the stage.

					TYRELL
			Go baby! Go!

	AT THE STAGE

	CLOSE ON the karaoke machine. Karla flips through a binder full of
	songs.

					KARLA
			Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is
			for somebody who really needs it.
				(finds one)
			Ah-hah! One single with extra cheese!

					NANCY
				(it's true)
			Everyone thinks their a singer.

					JULIE
			No way.

					KARLA
			Yes.

					JULIE
			No.

					KARLA
			Yes.

					JULIE
			Not me...no way...

					WILL
			Come on, it'll be fun.

					KARLA
			Ladies and gentlemen, please put your
			hands together for my friend, my very
			best friend, Julie James.

	But there will be no mercy.

					KARLA, TYRELL, & WILL
				(chanting in unison)
			Ju-lie! Ju-lie! Ju-lie!

	Reluctantly she goes to the song book. She sees something
	particularily awful.

					JULIE
			You asked for it.
				(to Tyrell)
			Song number thirty-nine.

	Tyrell nods and punches a few buttons. Julie takes the stage as sappy
	strings begin to swell. She looks at the MONITOR, then
	melodramatically at the crowd, and begins to sing -- no, BELT --
	Gloria Gaynor's "I WILL SURVIVE."

					JULIE (cont'd)
				(singing)
			First I was afraid...I was petrified...
				(continues singing under)

	Will stands, clapping. Tyrell pounds his chest. Karla flips up her
	LIGHTER, swaying like a hard-core fan. And Julie continues, crooning
	out the chorus as the beat kicks in and the gang begins to dance.

					JULIE (cont'd)
				(singing)
			I will survive...I will survive...

	ANGLE ON THE KARAOKE MONITOR

	The schmaltzy lyrics keep scrolling by -- white against black. But
	then...in the middle of the song...the color changes. RED CAPITAL\
	LETTERS BEGIN TO FILL THE SCREEN.

					JULIE (cont'd)
				(singing --
				then trailing off)
			And I still know...what you did...
			last summer...

	Her voice trails. Her smile abruptly fades.

	MICROPHONE

	falls to the floor. The room echoes with an electronic WHUMP. Everyone
	stops dancing, confused.

	CLOSE - JULIE

	trembling, shaking, a mess. Will jumps onstage.

					WILL
			Julie? What's wrong?

					JULIE
			It's...him.

					WILL
			What do you mean, Julie?

					JULIE
			He did something to the screen...it,
			it, said...

	Julie loos at the screen -- the normal lyrics are still scrolling. She
	suddenly feels their eyes upon her. They're looking at her like she's
	having a nervous breakdown.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			Nothing. Nothing, I'm sorry...

	Stung, she rushes off the stage.

					KARLA
			Julie...

	But it's to late. She's bolted from the bar.

									CUT TO:

28	INT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Julie steps into her room. Closes the door behind her. She falls back
	against it, trying to calm herself down.

					JULIE
			There's no way...just stop it right
			now...

	She looks around the cozy room.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			Closet. Bed. Bathroom. No need to panic.

	Julie starts to undress, get ready for bed, the day of travel finally
	catching up with her. She grabs something to sleep in. Tosses it on
	the bed. And that's when she sees it,

	CLOSE - ENVELOPE

	propped on the pillows. Her name written across. She is frozen
	momentarily.

	Almost against her will, she moves toward the envelope. She reaches
	down and picks it up.

	She hesitates, then opens the envelope. She pulls out a SINGLE WHITE
	CARD.

	ANGLE ON THE CARD

	In bold print it reads: SURPRISE!

	DARKFIGURE

	appears over Julie's shoulder. Julie can feel the presence. She spins,
	scaring --

	WILL

	who YELLS and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding. The
	bottle bursts and covers them with spray.

					JULIE
				(realizing)
			Oh, Will! I'm sorry.

					WILL
			It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I
			didn't think...

	She grabs a TOWEL off the bathroom door, trying to help him clean up
	the mess.

					JULIE
			No, no, no. This was really sweet...

					WILL
			I scared you -- I crossed the line --

					JULIE
			No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a
			little on edge. I'm really sorry.

					WILL
			Hey, you don't have to appologize to me.
			I'm the one. I understand.
				(covering the awkwardness)
			I'm going to take a walk and dry off.

					JULIE
			Are you sure? I really appreciate it.

	He picks up a rose. Most of its petals on the floor.

					WILL
			I just really like you and I want you to
			feel good about everything...You know? I
			want you to be happy.

	He hands the rose to her. There's a moment between them. He
	reluctantly heads for the door.

									CUT TO:

28A	EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Will looks down at his wet pants.

					WILL
				(soto)
			Dork.

	Passing Karla and Tyrell's room on his way down the hall, Will spots
	the DO NOT DISTURB SIGN.

	He hears an INCREDIBLE POUNDING from inside. He shakes his head and
	mopes down the hall.

									CUT TO:

29	INT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Karla bounces playfully on their big bed as Tyrell crosses toward the
	windows.

					KARLA
			Tha's it.
				(bounce)
			I've decided.
				(bounce)
			I'm changing my major to finance.
				(bounce)
			And going to Wall Street.

					TYRELL
			Why?

					KARLA
			'Cause that's the only way I'm ever
			gonna be able to afford a big bed like
			this.

	She falls back against the plush comforter, looking up at herself in a
	long MIRROR HANGING RIGHT OVER THE BED. Tyrell loves this and quickly
	moves beside her in the bed. She lets him get real close, then she
	jumps up --

					KARLA (cont'd)
			Jacuzzi.

	Tyrell reaches for her, but she bounces off the bed.

					TYRELL
			Ah, baby, let's stay right here.

	Karla pulls her suit out of a bag and models it seductively and
	flirtatiously for Tyrell.

					KARLA
			I spent a hundred bucks on it...even if
			it's just so you can pull it off.

	Tyrell gets off the bed --

					TYRELL
			I like the sound of this.

									CUT TO:

30	EXT. HOTEL DOCKS - NIGHT

	Derrick, the dockhand, whistles in the darkness as he coils the bow
	rope of a service boat around a cleat on the dock.

	Ominous shadows play all along the dock. Out on the water there's a
	big SPLASH.

	The dockhand rises, looking out at the water with a sigh.

					DERRICK
			Damn. I should've brought my pole.

	He turns away. As he does, we see

	THE END OF THE DOCK

	where a sinister SLICKER FIGURE stands perfectly still, silhouetted by
	moonlight.

	Derrick paces down the dock the other way past a handfull of other
	tied-off staff and service boats.

	He picks up a hose and begins spraying down the hull of a Sunfish
	sailboat.

	He turns the hose off and begins coiling it, backing toward an
	EQUIPMENT SHACK. Suddenly, a HAND touches him on the back. He jumps
	and turns to see --

	TITUS

	standing there smoking a spliff.

					DERRICK
			Get lost, you scared me.

					TITUS
			Fish are all over the water...Come on,
			let us take a boat out.

					DERRICK
			Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up
			in Spain.

					TITUS
			That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.

	Derrick throws the hose in its place.

					DERRICK
			There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats
			are going out.

					TITUS
			Storm is what makes it interesting.
			Thass why all the fish are up. Less
			hook us a couple big ones.

	Derrick is now ignoring Titus.

					DERRICK
			I got work to do. Take the bake
			elsewhere.

					TITUS
			Up-tighteous and self-righteous.

	Titus glides away into the dark. Derrick watches him go. There's
	another SPLASH in the water near the dock.

	Derrick walks to where the splash was. He kneels down by the edge --
	watching BUBBLES RISE from the dark water below.

					DERRICK
				(to the fish)
			Hello, little sea bass. You're lucky
			I'm busy or I'd hook you myself.

	WE PUSH IN AS HIS FACE GETS CLOSER TO THE WATER --

	AND THEN -- RISING SLOWLY FROM THE DARK WATER DIRECTLY BEHIND THE
	DOCKHAND -- A SINISTER SLICKER.

	Derrick hears A SPLASH -- and just in time for...

	SPLAT! THE OLD HOOK IN THE EYE. THE FISHERMAN PULLS HIM DOWN. HE
	SCREAMS -- BEN YANKS ON THE HOOK -- AND DERRICK'S CRUMPLED BODY FALLS
	INTO THE WATER.

	ANGLE ON THE WATER

	as poor Derrick's BLOOD MIXES WITH BUBBLES...

									CUT TO:

31	EXT. POOL/JACUZZI - NIGHT

	Bubbles of a different kind. The JACUZZI sits in an enclosure at the
	shallow end of the SWIMMING POOL.

	And enjoying its warmth, Karla and Tyrell are liplocked in the
	churning tub. MUSIC plays on the boombox beside them.

	The tempurature rises and Ty's hands begin to wander. Still clad in
	her cute bikini, Karla pulls away --

					KARLA
			You sure you didn't pick up my hair
			tie?

					TYRELL
				(rubbing his bald head)
			Hello?

					KARLA
			Okay, I just didn't wanna get my
			hair wet.

					TYRELL
			Baby, I finally got you alone in this
			Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin'
			hair care.

	She splashes him.

					KARLA
			Don't you get feisty...

	Tyrell moves in for the kill. He won't take no for an answer.

					TYRELL
			Too late for that. We're miles from
			anywhere, baby. No one's gonna hear
			you scream.

	He goes in for a serious kiss. Things start to heat up --

					KARLA
			I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to
			have to blow my whistle.

					TYRELL
				(playful)
			I'd hate for you to have to blow...your
			whistle.

	Tyrell is done talking. He pulls her over to him and the moment
	becomes more passionate.

	Karla opens her eyes in time to see --

	TITUS

	surface in the pool next to them.

	Karla SCREAMS. And not just because it was a surprise. Titus looks
	even uglier when he's wet.

	Titus opens his mouth, reveals a smoking PHILLY BLUNT on the end of
	his tounge.

					TITUS
			No water sports after midnight. Hotel
			policy.

	Titus eyes Karla in the Jacuzzi. Tyrell moves protectively in front of
	her.

					TYRELL
			What's the policy on burnin' herb?

					TITUS
			We got one for that, too. It's don't
			try until you buy.
				(beat)
			You don't buy any, you don't get any.

	Titus blows a cloud of smoke on them both, rolls the joint back into
	his mouth, and swims off. Tyrell is angry, but Karla pulls him back.

	A dejected Will appears in his bathing suit, a towel over his arm.
	Tyrell sees him coming.

					TYRELL
			There's ten people on this whole island
			and they're all gonna end up in this
			Jacuzzi with us.

					WILL
				(getting in)
			How's the water?

					TYRELL
			Crowded.

					KARLA
			Ty!

	Will slips into the water ignoring Tyrell's look.

					WILL
			Ahh, that feels great.

					KARLA
				(considerate)
			How's Julie?

					WILL
			Alone. In the room.
				(to Karla)
			Got any advise?

					TYRELL
				(annoyed)
			Yeah. Find another Jacuzzi.

	Karla shoots Tyrell a look.

					KARLA
				(to Will)
			Your not out yet, slugger. You gotta
			just get back up there and keep
			swingin'.

									CUT TO:

31A	EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Ray is at a telephone booth up the street from Julie's apartment.

	He looks exausted. Blood seeps through his shirt. He's in pain.

					RAY
			I need an international operator.

									CUT TO:

31B	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	In the empty night lobby, behind the desk

	THE TELEPHONE

	RINGS and RINGS. We push in on the phone RINGING unanswered in the
	night. Nobody is around to answer it.

									CUT TO:

32	INT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	The DOOR CREAKS OPEN once again to her room. And from a STRANGER'S POV
	-- WE SLOWLY CREEP INSIDE.

	A CLOUD OF STEAM billows from the open BATHROOM. THE SOUND OF A SHOWER
	is heard. We MOVE TOWARD IT.

	INT. SHOWER

	Eyes closed, Julie stands with her face right under the showerhead,
	trying to relax. Something softly goes THUMP.

	Julie opens her eyes. Turns off the shower. Stands there, frozen,
	listening.

					JULIE
				(calling out)
			Will...?

	No reply.

	AT THE BATHROOM DOORWAY

	In a robe with a towel on her head, Julie peeks into her room. Nobody
	there. She sighs, and crosses back to the bathroom sink.

	AT THE SINK

	Julie looks to a spot where her toothbrush should be. She frowns.
	Looks around. Some of her things are missing. She peers into the
	fogged-up bathroom mirror.

	She whips the TOWEL off her head and WIPES IT ACROSS THE MIRROR,
	MAKING THE BEDROOM BEHIND HER VISIBLE.

	Ready to spit, she looks down. AND IN THAT INSTANT -- WE SEE A SHADOWY
	FIGURE PASS BEHIND HER IN THE BEDROOM. She looks back up...and HE'S
	GONE. Julie turns on the water to rinse.

	ANGLE ON THE BEDROOM DOOR

	as it SLOWLY CREAKS SHUT, the SOUND DROWNED OUT by the SINK.

	INT. BATHROOM

	Julie turns off the water -- and KLUNK-KLUNK -- and NOISE at her door.
	The sound STOPS.

	INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM

	She steps out of the bathroom, crossing toward the door.

					JULIE
			Will?

	No answer. She peers through the PEEPHOLE.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			Is that you?

	She unlocks and opens it. Nobody there.

	Julie quickly closes the door and relocks it, her heart rate just
	begining to rise again as...

	KLUNK-KLUNK. She hears it again. Then, the sound STOPS. But standing
	at the door -- she realizes that's not where it came from. Her eyes
	immediately go to...

	THE CLOSET

	Damn. That's where it came from. She slowy pads across the room in her
	slippers toward the door. Trembling...she reaches for the handle...AND
	TUGS IT OPEN!

	There's NOTHING. She stares a beat. DRIP DRIP DRIP.

	She sees something on the floor of the closet. She touches a finger to
	it.

	IT'S BLOOD.

	She looks up.

	THE DOCKHAND

	comes dropping down at her, dangling, enmeshed in barbed wire. He's
	dying before our eyes. Blood bubbling from his mouth. His body
	twitching.

	Julie stares at the body. She's almost catatonic. She blinks. She
	blinks again.

	Suddenly, in DEATH CONVULSIONS, his arms fly toward her --

	She SCREAMS --

									CUT TO:

33	EXT. POOL - JACUZZI - NIGHT

	Karla and Tyrell are drying off beside Will as their hysterical friend
	comes racing across the pool plaza.

					JULIE
			It's happening again! There's a body!

	Will cathes her in his arms and she sobs uncontrollably.

					WILL
			What? What are you talking about?
			Where?

					JULIE
			It's in my room!

	They can see she's not fooling around.

									BACK TO:

34	INT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Everyone is gathered in the center of Julie's room. Julie is held
	tight by Will. Brooks, the hotel manager, conducts the investigation.

	Brooks approaches the closet door. Julie holds her breath. He throws
	it open. A long beat.

					BROOKS
			I don't find this at all funny.

	Julie steps in -- stares into the empty closet. She can't believe her
	eyes.

	She searches their faces, looking for someone to believe her.

					JULIE
			There was a body! I swear it!

					WILL
				(delicately)
			Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe
			you were dreaming.

					JULIE
				(sharp)
			I wasn't dreaming.

					BROOKS
			I knew you people were goining to be
			trouble. I knew from the first time I
			laid eyes on you.

	Julie grabs Brooks by his robe.

					JULIE
			Listen to me. He's here.

					BROOKS
			Who? Who is here?

	She doesn't know where to start. Nancy pokes her head around the door.

					NANCY
			What's going on?

					TYRELL
			Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the
			closet.

					NANCY
			Cool.

					TYRELL
			The rest of us see bathrobes.

					JULIE
				(sharp)
			I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right
			there.

					TYRELL
				(not taking it seriously)
			Fine. Show me the body.

	Will wanders over to the closet and checks it out.

					KARLA
			Think about this, Julie. What did you
			actually see?

					JULIE
			The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck
			from up there.

					BROOKS
				(case closed)
			In the morning we'll talk to Derrick, the
			"dockhand guy," and put the whole thing
			to rest.
				(looks to Nancy)
			Now, let's slow down on the Dark and
			Stormies and get some sleep.

					NANCY
			Don't look at me --

					JULIE
			I want off this island.

					BROOKS
				(tired)
			Not possible, I'm afraid. The last ferry
			left hours ago. And we got a storm
			coming. There won't be another one for
			days.

					TYRELL
			There's a storm coming?

					BROOKS
			'Tis the season, like I told you. It's a
			big one.

	Julie goes for the phone.

					JULIE
			Then I'll call the mainland for a
			charter.

					BROOKS
			Phones went down a few minutes ago.

	She picks up the phone, listens, then dangles it from her hand.

					JULIE
			It's dead.

	An exasperated Brooks heads for the door.

					BROOKS
			Duh. The next couple of days is gonna
			be rough, but we'll make it.

					KARLA
			What about a radio?

					BROOKS
			Sorry. Emergencies only.

					KARLA
			What the hell would you call this?

					BROOKS
			I'd call this four spoiled city kids who
			wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up
			their butts.
				(beat)
			All we can do now is batten down and ride
			it out. If things get really bad, there's
			a storm shelter.

	And Brooks is gone. Outside the window, it starts to rain. There's a
	CLAP of thunder.

	JULIE

	looks out the window with glazed-over eyes.

35	EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

	And we PULL AWAY from Julie's face through the glass -- SLOWLY TILTING
	above her room to another

	TINY WINDOW

	in the bell tower. A candle burns, and lighning flashes illuminate the
	haggard face of Estes, the porter.

									CUT TO:

36	INT. HOTEL TOWER ROOM - NIGHT

	It's a claustrophobic room. Estes turns away from the window,
	shirtless in his uniform pants. A beaded cord hangs around his neck,
	small fishhook dangling from it.

	Beside the candle, he picks up a leather bag and dumps out a handful
	of voodoo icons: roots, coins, sea glass, chicken's foot. He sets them
	on a divination tray.

	He opens vials and sprinkles powder and assorted liquids into a small
	wooden bowl. He opens a drawer and extracts a toothbrush. He dips the
	brush in the bowl -- covering its bristles with a sticky goo. He holds
	the brush over the candle's flame. The old man watches it SIZZLE.

	ESTES picks up

	A STRAW FIGURE

	and impales it on his fishhook necklace.

	His eyes roll back in his head. He enters a trance.

									DISSOLVE TO:

37	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Olga, the maid, pushes her laundry cart toward the end of a long,
	dimly lit hall. She sees a pile of dirty linens outside of a room --
	ROOM 228.

	She stops, perplexed. There's nobody staying in this room. She picks
	them up and stuff them in her cart. Then she knocks on the door.

					OLGA
			Housekeeping.
				(beat)
			Housekeeping.

	She knocks again and notices her hand leaving bloody marks on the
	door. She looks at her other hand. Her arms and hands are covered in
	blood.

	She turns back to the linens. Something bloody is wrapped inside of
	them. She paws at the sheets, trying to unravel the mystery --

	The door the Room 228 slowly cracks open. A STEEL HOOK reaches out and
	slices into her apron. It tugs. She turns, and she starts to SCREAM,
	she is yanked into the room.

	A DO NOT DISTURB sign flips over the handle and the door SLAMS shut.

	We hear her SCREAMS from inside.

									CUT TO:

38	EXT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	Establishing. Bars on the windows. Neon PAWN fickering. Hand-painted
	sign reads: Se Habla Ingles.

39	INT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

	CLOSE ON AN ENGAGEMENT RING

	Ray's engagement ring. The pawn shop owner, MAC, cowboy hat, knows his
	job, holds it up to the viewing loop next to his eye.

					MAC
			Jeez, that's a full carat --

					RAY
			How much?

					MAC
			Well, there's some flaws in her...

					RAY
			How much?

	Mac looks around his shop at the usual jumble of crap: vacuum
	cleaners, golf clubs, guitar amps...

					MAC
			Don't really have the market for
			something like this...
				(like it hurts him)
			I can go two...two-fifty.

					RAY
			Make it three hundred. And throw
			that in, too.

	REVEAL - .38 REVOLVER

	encased in a glass cabinet.

					MAC
			Hell, that's worth three, easy. And
			you got your waiting period.

					RAY
			I'm not waiting...So give me the gun
			and keep the ring.

	Mac barely hasitates, he knows he's getting a steal --

					MAC
			Fine, buddy.

	THE GUN AND THE RING

	go down on the counter next to each other. Mac pulls out some forms.

					MAC (cont'd)
			Fill these out. Leave the dates blank.

	Ray starts writing. Mac is overcome by a moment of humanity.

					MAC (cont'd)
			Buddy, are you sure this is the way
			you want to go?

	Ray gives him a steely stare --

					RAY
			Is it loaded?

	Mac shakes his head.

					RAY (cont'd)
			Load it.

	Off Mac's sadness at young people today.

									CUT TO:

40	INT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - DAY

	We move into the hotel room and gradually reveal FOUR SETS OF FEET at
	the end of one bed. They are crammed into a king-size bed together.

	Julie is awake. She gets out of bed and moves toward the window.

	It's raining outside. The wind is blowing. The storm has arrived.

	Karla pulls a sleeping hand off her chest. The hand belongs to Will.
	She pinches the hand. Will starts.

	Tyrell kicks his feet around, trying to get some room.

					TYRELL
			This ain't the romantic weekend I
			had in mind.

	Karla kisses Tyrell on the cheek.

					KARLA
				(to Julie)
			You get any sleep at all?

					JULIE
			Some.

	Tyrell glares at Julie by the window. Sees the incredible rain.

					TYRELL
			Oh, look. Another day in paradise
			with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss
			Psychotic Episode.

					KARLA
			Hey --

					TYRELL
				(calling to Julie)
			See any dead bodies out there? Any
			fresh kill? How 'bout Freddy, Jason?

	Julie ignores him, staring out the window.

					WILL
			Leave her alone.

	Angry at her boyfriend, Karla gets out of bed and joins Julie.

					TYRELL
			I'm just saying what all of you are
			thinking. It's bad enough gettin'
			rained out without having to hold
			her hand the whole time.

					WILL
			You don't have to be a jerk.

	Karla pulls Julie close in a show of support for her friend whose mind
	everyone believes has been inventing dead bodies.

					JULIE
			It's okay...He doesn't believe me.
			That's his right. I'm starting to
			think I'm crazy, too.

					KARLA
			Hey, slow down, turn off the little
			motor up in there...What do you say
			we go to the gym and work off a
			little stress?

	Julie doesn't look to enthusiastic.

									CUT TO:

41	INT. HOTEL FITNESS ROOM - DAY

	Karla and Julie enter the gym. It has Nautilus machines, treadmills,
	Life-cycles, free weights, tanning beds, speed and heavy bags.

	Karla walks over and does a full roundhouse -- spinning and planting
	her foot dead center of the heavy bag.

					JULIE
			Nice move.

					KARLA
			I'll be givin' your fisherman some of
			that and see how he likes it.

	Julie smiles at her friend bravado. She steps over to a stairmaster
	and starts her workout.

									CUT TO:

42	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

	Will and Tyrell step out of the room into the long, empty corridor.
	They cross to a balcony overlooking the lobby. The whole place seems
	deserted.

					TYRELL
			Where is everybody?

					WILL
				(gallows humor)
			They're all dead...Dead, I tell you.
				(ghostly)
			Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll,
			joinnnn usss.

	Will's voice echoes across the lobby. Tyrell is maybe a little
	nervous, but hiding it.

					TYRELL
			Shut up.

	They walk down the steps to the lobby.

43	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

	They cross the lobby.

					WILL
				(calling out)
			Hello?
				(worried)
			There's nobody here, Tyrell.

	Tyrell's already out the front entrance.

44	EXT. HOTEL - DAY

	Will and Tyrell exit the hotel and make their way down the steps
	outside and go splashing across the flooded grounds. Debris from the
	storm is scattered all around them.

					TYRELL
			They're around...They just don't
			care about us 'cause we're the
			contest winners.
				(beat)
			Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his
			lazy butt hook us up with fishing
			poles or Ping-Pong paddles or
			something.

					WILL
				(nervous)
			You know, the greenhouse effect has
			caused the gulf stream to shift and
			almost every meteorological expert
			expects a dramatic increase in
			tropical depression --

					TYRELL
			Hey -- shut up, okay?

	Tyrell keeps walking. Will looks around at the wind-and-water-swept
	vista. Not much of a day for activities.

					WILL
				(sotto)
			I don't like to fish.

	Tyrell moves across the grounds. He looks back. Will is stopped in his
	tracks, looking up at --

	IN THE WINDOW OF THE BELL TOWER --

	ESTES, staring down at them.

					TYRELL
				(calling to Will)
			You coming?

	Will trots after him, but he takes a glance back at the window...Estes
	is gone.

									CUT TO:

45	INT. HOTEL FITNESS ROOM - DAY

	Julie has finished on the stairmaster. Both she and Karla are sweaty
	after a good workout. Their moods have improved.

					KARLA
			Come on, Vampira. I got just the
			thing for you.

	Karla leads Julie over to the tanning beds.

					JULIE
			Cancer in a box.

					KARLA
			No, this is the safe sun.
				(joking)
			It's better than a day at the beach.

	Julie is reluctant.

					KARLA (cont'd)
			Come on, a little photosynthesis and
			you'll feel like a new --

					JULIE
			Houseplant.

	Karla opens the canopy of the tanning bed.

					KARLA
			Exactly.

	Julie peels off her sweats. Lies down in her underwear. Straps on a
	small pair of GOGGLES.

	Karla lowers the canopy over Julie.

	ANGLE ON A WALL TIMER

	Karla sets the DIAL.

					KARLA (cont'd)
			Set to three seventy-five, bake for
			one hour...

					JULIE
			Karla!

					KARLA
			Just kidding.

	ULTRA-VIOLET TUBES

	come to life -- Julie is bathed in purple light.

									CUT TO:

46	EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY

	Tyrell looks across the grounds and sees, at the far end of the tennis
	court,

	TITUS'S POOL SUPPLY CART

	half-obscured by the heavy fooliage surrounding the court.

	Tyrell walks away from Will toward the cart. He hears the jam-box on
	the cart playing "TRENCHTOWN ROCK" by Bob Marley..."One good thing
	about music...when it hits you feel no pain..."

46A	EXT. HOTEL TENNIS COURT - DAY

	The open door of the entrance CLANGS against the fence in the wind.
	Tyrell decides to cut through the court to the far entrance and the
	cart.

46B	INT. HOTEL TENNIS COURT - DAY

	Tyrell walks across the court to the sagging net.

	There is a RUSTLING in the foliage around the court. SOMETHING moving
	fast and quietly.

					TYRELL
				(calling out)
			Hey, Bong Marley. Come here.

	The door SLAMS shut behind him.

	Tyrell looks back at the door. The latch seems to have stuck and it's
	no longer swinging.

	Tyrell turns back toward the other door and sees

	The PIT BULL

	standing in the doorway. Tyrell stares at the dog. The dog GROWLS at
	Tyrell, low and menacing.

					TYRELL
			I'm gonna kill you, Bong Boy.

	Simultaneously, Tyrell turns and the dog lunges forward.

	Tyrell sprints to the door -- it's LOCKED by a length of metal slipped
	into the coupling.

	He turns to see the dog bounding at him --

	Tyrell leaps up the fence just as the pit bull lunges for him. The dog
	catches his pant leg. Tyrell kicks him away and frantically scrambles
	up.

	The dog relentlessly barks and snaps as Tyrell climbs the fence.

	WILL

	looks in at the dog angrily charging the chain-link. He looks up at
	Tyrell.

					WILL
			Come on. Jump. I've got you.

	He reaches out to try and catch Tyrell.

	ON THE FENCE

	Tyrell finally looses his grip and falls back, landing on top of Will.
	He rolls quickly to his feet.

					TYRELL
			Thanks.
				(furious)
			I gotta find me a pool boy.

									CUT TO:

47	INT. HOTEL FITNESS ROOM - DAY

	Karla hammers the bag with a series of quick punches. She finally
	stops to catch her breath and hears a THUMPING from the other room.

48	INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

	Karla sticks her head out the door to the gym, listening. At the end
	of the hall

	AN OPEN DOOR

	is visible, a single BARE BULB lighting the room. Karla moves
	curiously toward it.

49	INT. BASEMENT ROOM - DAY

	Karla slowly sticks her head around the corner just as the THUMPING
	NOISE SOUNDS LOUNDLY. She reacts --

	A THUMPING DRYER

	in a small laundry room. Karla relaxes.

					KARLA
				(doing Julie)
			Gee, Karla...That'll break the
			machine...

	She approaches the MACHINE, which is rocking with the noise.

					KARLA (cont'd)
			Damn. How many pairs you got in
			there?

	She opens the dryer door and jumps back.

	A BLOODY SHOE

	flies out and into her arms. She looks down a beat, and SCREAMS bloody
	murder.

	A hot spray of blood gushes from the machine.

	REVEAL - OLGA'S DISMEMBERED BODY

	tumbling inside the dryer. Karla SCREAMS again. Then she hears the
	SOUND of heavy boots coming down the hall. She runs to the door and
	locks it.

	She's trapped in a bloody basement cell. Suddenly somebody POUNDS on
	the door. Karla SCREAMS.

	She runs across the room, shoving a folding table toward a row of
	BASEMENT WINDOWS.

	The door is hit again and again. Somebody is throwing their shoulder
	against it.

	Karla bangs hysterically on the windows, leaving bloody handprints on
	the panes.

									CUT TO:

50	INT. TANNING ROOM - DAY

	Julie's eyes suddenly open through the GOGGLES. She thumbs off her
	WALKMAN.

					JULIE
			You say something?

	Nothing. And just as Julie lies down again, Karla's frantic SCREAMS
	echo down the hall.

	Julie goes to push open the canopy. As she does, the CANOPY LID is
	JAMMED DOWN ON TOP OF HER. A CHAIN shoots through the handles. Julie
	is locked on the grill.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			Karla! Somebody? Hey, this isn't
			funny.

	Suddenly the lights go off. Julie thrashes around, trying to free
	herself.

	JULIE'S POV - THROUGH THE PURPLE LIGHT

	She sees someone walking around in the room. The person steps closer.
	Julie could almost reach out and touch him.

	She begins to SCREAM!

51	EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY

	Tyrell angrily makes his way past the outdoor pool bar as Will
	follows. Tyrell spots a tray of empty bottles. He picks one up and
	smashes it in half on the ground. He holds out the jagged bottle to
	Will.

					TYRELL
			Take this.

					WILL
			And do what with it?

	Tyrell breaks another bottle in half.

					TYRELL
			Julienne of pool boy.

	They move toward the nearby POOL HOUSE.

52	EXT. POOL HOUSE - DAY

	Tyrell and Will stop outside the door. There's MUSIC from inside. More
	Bob Marley -- "Lively Up Yourself..."

					TYRELL (cont'd)
			I'm gonna throw the door. Get ready.

	Tyrell opens the door and charges in. Will's right behind him.

53	INT. HOTEL POOL HOUSE - DAY

	They spill into the room. A light fog hangs in the air. The two of
	them begin to COUGH and CHOKE.

	Titus sits on the floor facing away from them, facing a window through
	which gray light pierces the gloom.

	Titus doesn't move. He's too still. In front of him is a large BONG
	that still SMOKES SLIGHTLY.

					TYRELL
			Hey, pool boy.

	Tyrell closes the distance and kicks Titus in the back.

	Titus falls over like a block of wood, rictus already setting in.

	His hands are bound behind him. The cord is tied off to some pipes
	against the wall.

	HIS FINGERNAILS SCRATHCED GROOVES

	into the floor, scrabbling for the window and fresh air.

	Will points out two empty one-gallon PLASTIC BOTTLES.

	ANGLE ON THE BOTTLES

	One is labeled CHLORINE, the other MURIATIC ACID.

	Will pulls Tyrell from the pool house.

54	EXT. HOTEL POOL HOUSE - DAY

	The two of them collapse, COUGHING and CHOKING.

					TYRELL
			What the -- ?

	Will splashes a puddle of rainwater on his face --

					WILL
			That's chlorine and muriatic acid.
			Put the two together and you get
			cyanide.

	Tyrell rolls over on his back next to Will, practically coughing up a
	lung.

					TYRELL
			Cyanide? Like poison gas?
				(reality dawning)
			You mean, somebody really killed
			him...Omigod. Think...Think...

	Suddenly, they both hear KARLA SCREAMING. They sprint for the main
	building.

									CUT TO:

55	EXT. BASEMENT WINDOW - DAY

	Tyrell and Will follow Karla's CRIES to a narrow srip of basement
	window which runs along the side of the hotel. Her palms have bloodied
	one of the windows.

					TYRELL
			Get back --

56	INT. HOTEL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

	Karla ducks down on the table just as the window EXPLODES inward.
	Tyrell kicks in the pane and looks in.

					TYRELL (cont'd)
			Give me your hand!

	She reaches for him. He pulls her up and out through the window.

57	EXT. BASEMENT WINDOW - DAY

	Karla tumbles to the ground with only one thing to say.

					KARLA
				(screaming)
			Julie!

									SMASH CUT TO:

58	INT. TANNING ROOM - DAY

	Tyrell and Will suddenly burst through the door.

	ANGLE ON THE TANNING BED

	Where Julie is just visible, her fingers madly groping for a way out.

					JULIE
			Oh, God, get me out. Get me out.

	Will struggles to open the bed, but the chain holds strong.

	Tyrell grabs a nearby dumbbell.

					TYRELL
			Hang on...

	ANGLE ON THE CHAIN

	Tyrell slams the barbell down, shattering the fiberglass handles.

	A few of the ultraviolet tubes POP as Will yanks up on the cover.

	They help Julie up, her eyes adjusting to non-purple light.

					JULIE
				(almost relieved)
			I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's
			here...
				(already moving
				for the door)
			We've got to get to the radio and
			call for help.

					KARLA
			I think we can classify this as an
			emergency situation.

	They head for the manager's office.

									CUT TO:

59	INT. HOTEL - BROOKS'S OFFICE - DAY

	They burst into the middle of the room before seeing that Brooks's
	head has a machete sticking out of it.

					TYRELL
			Yo, Brooks, listen up --
				(reacting)
			Whoa --

	Tyrell, Will, and Karla look at the radio, which is smashed on the
	floor next to Brooks.

	Julie stares in shock at the reverse wall, at

	A STUFFED MARLIN

	with the words "I STILL KNOW" written on it in blood.

	Karla SCREAMS --

					TYRELL
			Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting
			psycho.

					KARLA
			We gotta get out of here. Now.

	THE POWER CUTS OUT and the hotel plunges into darkness.

	Julie SCREAMS and runs from the hotel.

					WILL
			Julie!

60	EXT. HOTEL - DAY

	Julie runs down the steps and cuts through the blowing palms.

									CUT TO:

61	EXT. HOTEL DOCKS - DAY

	Julie is at the end of the dock. Tears are streaming down her face,
	her chest heaving.

	The others catch up with her. Karla realizes the boats are gone.
	Everyone is freaking out.

					KARLA
			There were boats here? Refresh my
			memory, there were boats...

	Tyrell picks up the end of a cut mooring line --

					TYRELL
			They were cut loose.

					WILL
			Julie? Wanna tell us what is
			going on here?

	They look at Julie. Their escape is cut off by water. They're scared.

					JULIE
				(freaking out)
			We're all going to die. He's going
			to kill us one by one.

					TYRELL
			Who?

					JULIE
			Ben Willis.

					KARLA
				(not this again)
			Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed
			him. Now, get over it. We gotta
			think here.

					JULIE
			They never found the body.

	Her voice is low and urgent, an impromptu confessional.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			Two summers ago. We lied to the
			authorities. We hit Ben Willis with
			our car. Ray, me, Barry, and Helen
			...We threw the body in the water to
			cover it up --

					KARLA
			Julie...

					JULIE
			Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry
			and Helen last July Fourth.

	Tyrell begins backing away from Julie. He picks up a piece of
	driftwood from the dock.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			I thought Ray and I killed him on the
			boat, but we didn't and now he's back
			to finish up the job.

	Tyrell holds up the log as a weapon. He's angry and afraid --

					TYRELL
			We're on an island, miles from
			anywhere. I don't give a crap about
			you're fisherman. There's dead bodies
			pilling up everywhere and there's one
			guy missing --

	Will moves closer to Tyrell --

					WILL
			The porter...what's his name? Old
			Asbestos --

					TYRELL
			Estes! That's exactly who it is. That
			old guy knows something. We can sit
			here and wait for him to pick us off
			or we can go find him first.

	Tyrell turns and heads down the dock. Will goes with him. Karla takes
	a few hesitant steps after them, then turns back toward Julie, who
	hasn't moved.

					KARLA
			Julie, we have to do something.

	Julie sees her friend caught in the middle, sees her suffering. She
	reluctantly starts for Karla --

					JULIE
				(sotto)
			It's not him.

									CUT TO:

62	INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

	Standard bus folks: old people in Panama hats, buzz-cut military geeks
	on holiday.

	Ray sits in a seat. He's in pain and does not look good.

	He pops a handful of pills into his mouth and washes them down with an
	Orange Crush --

	A dignified OLD LADY has been watching him --

					OLD LADY
			People live healthy in Miami.
				(sincere, but unsettling)
			It's the future down there every day
			of the week...The future.

	Ray slumps back, waiting for the pills to work.

					RAY
			I'll keep that in mind.

									CUT TO:

63	INT. HOTEL TOWER ROOM - DUSK

	The door to Estes's room BANGS inward. Tyrell, Will, Karla, and Julie
	charge into the room.

					TYRELL
			Yo, Freak Boy --

	The cluttered room is empty.

					WILL
			He's not here.

	Tyrell and Will begin roughly searching through Estes's possessions.

					TYRELL
			We're gonna find some weird crap
			in here.

	In the corner there is a curtain used as a partition. Julie pulls the
	curtain back and discovers

	A SMALL, HEAVY CABINET

	sitting in the corner. It seems to glow from inside while casting an
	evil pall over the room.

	Julie moves toward it and hesitates before opening the doors.

	Inside -- is a small voodoo shrine. A candle has burned low before it.
	Hanging before the altar is

	THE LITTLE STRAW MAN

	impaled on a fishhook.

					JULIE
			Voodoo.

					TYRELL
			I told you.

	Julie looks closer. She sees her toothbrush, a hair tie, assorted
	other knickknacks belonging to her friends.

					TYRELL
				(to Karla)
			Missing a hair tie?

	Karla looks in. Tyrell snatches the straw man up.

					TYRELL
			We found our guy.

	THUNDER rumbles across the sky like the judgement of God.

									CUT TO:

64	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Julie, Karla, Tyrell, and Will walk quickly down the corridor. They
	have grabbed some of their things.

					TYRELL
			We gotta find flashlights, torches,
			guns if they got 'em, anything
			that'll help.

	Will and Tyrell eye the stairs leading down to the lobby.

					TYRELL
			Wait. Maybe he's down there
			collecting the body parts.

	Will and Tyrell exchange a glance, an "are you man enough?" kind of
	glance.

					WILL
			Let's go.

65	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	The men head into the kitchen and bar area.

					WILL
			We'll only be a second, okay?

					TYRELL
			Yeah, wait right here, it's the
			safest place.

	Karla is terrified and waits by the stairs, but something catches
	Julie's eye. She walks across the lobby.

					KARLA
			Julie, where are you going?

	Julie keeps walking. She sees historical pictures of the hotel: work
	crews during construction; the first limbo contest; fishermen standing
	next to sailfish and marlin.

	Near the pictures, Julie sees the globe. It's spinning slowly.

	Julie hesitates, then walks toward the globe. It stops spinning. She
	looks down at it.

	CLOSE ON - THE GLOBE

	and Julie's hand finding Brazil. We see the capital is not Rio, but
	Brazilia. This is dawning on Julie when we hear --

					ESTES (v.o.)
			Brasilia.

	She jumps out of her skin. Estes was standing right there in the
	shadows.

					ESTES (cont'd)
			That's the capital of Brazil, not
			Rio.

	Karla SCREAMS.

	Tyrell comes flying across the lobby past Karla. He dives on Estes,
	tackling him to the floor. Will is right behind him.

					WILL/ESTES/TYRELL
			Let go. I got him. That's me. It's
			him. We got you...

					JULIE
			Leave him alone.

	Tyrell holds up battered Estes --

					TYRELL
			Here's youre killer --

					ESTES
			No --

					WILL
			We found your voodoo crap --

					ESTES
			No --

	They shake Estes, finally giving him a chance to speak.

					ESTES (cont'd)
			I found the bodies this morning...I
			tried to use the radio, but he
			already destroyed it.

					JULIE
			Let him go. I believe him.

					KARLA
			Come on, Julie. You saw his room.

					ESTES
			I haven't hurt anyone...I stole
			those things to help you. To
			protect you.

					JULIE
			He's telling the truth. He could've
			easily killed me. He didn't.
				(beat while
				this sinks in)
			Look, we didn't even answer the
			radio question right...This whole
			thing was a setup.

					KARLA
			What do you mean?

					JULIE
			Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It
			was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.

					TYRELL
				(starting to lose it)
			You've got all these theories but
			where is he? Where? Where's your
			fisherman killer?

					JULIE
			I don't know.

					TYRELL
				(losing it)
			You never do...The guy at the
			nightclub, the body in your room last
			night. Little notes that only mean
			something to you. How do we even know
			you're not the one behind this --

	Estes steps forward --

					JULIE
				(to Tyrell)
			How do we know you're not?

					ESTES
				(to Julie)
			I know who you're talking about. He
			used to work here at the hotel.
				(beat)
			And I've seen him around again. Out
			in the woods by the orchard.

	They look at Estes...Is he telling the truth?

					ESTES
			I can't remeber his name, but I
			don't forget a face.
				(beseeching)
			I can show you...

	They stare a beat --

					WILL
			How do we know you're not setting
			us up?

					ESTES
			Where else you gonna go, son?

	They look to the office, the gym...The sense of death surrounding
	them.

					KARLA
			I know I don't want to stay in
			here.

					JULIE
			We'll be better off in the open. If
			we stick together, maybe we can kill
			this creep for good.

					TYRELL
			Show us.

	They begin moving for the door.

									CUT TO:

66	EXT. FERRY DOCKS - NIGHT

	Establish. The rain pounds a fleet of fishing boats. The boats are
	securely battened down in the weather.

	Ray limps past, heading for a small building at the end of the dock.
	Its sign reads: Island Ferry, Jack Paulsen -- proprieter.

									CUT TO:

67	INT. PAULSEN'S BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT

	A gear-strewn office. Paulsen watches an episode of Party of Five.
	There is a loud KNOCKING at the door.

					PAULSEN
			What the...

	Paulsen slowly gets up. He cracks the door open. Ray stands
	silhouetted against the rain.

					RAY
			I need to get to Tower Bay Island.

	Paulsen senses something isn't right.

					PAULSEN
			We're closed.

	Ray pushes his way in --

					RAY
			I need to get there, now.

	Paulsen looks at him standing there drenched.

					PAULSEN
			Did you happen to notice what's
			going on outside?

	Ray pulls out the gun and points it at Paulsen --

					RAY
			I'm not looking for a weather
			report, I'm looking for a boat. So
			which one's yours?

									CUT TO:

68	EXT. WOODS TRAIL - NIGHT

	Estes, Will, Tyrell, Julie, and Karla walk along a trail through the
	heart of the island. The storm has abated for a few minutes.

	It's windy, dark, and spooky. The kind of place you'd take people if
	you wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story. That is just what
	Estes is doing.

					ESTES
			He worked here for many years. He
			had a nice family. A pretty wife
			and two little ones. A boy and a
			girl. They'd be about your age, now.

	They continue along the path.

	Estes looks at them in the dark, slowing for just a second.

					ESTES (cont'd)
			One day his wife went missing. Maid
			found blood all over the honeymoon
			suite -- Room 201.

	There are strange NOISES out in the woods.

					ESTES (cont'd)
			Eventually, they found her body.
			Pieces. A leg in the swamp. An arm
			washed up on Three Mile Beach.
				(beat)
			And the head they found much later.

	A huge branch is blown from a tree and comes crashing down through the
	underbrush, scaring them. Estes calmly steps around it.

					ESTES (cont'd)
			Careful --

					JULIE
				(softly)
			Did he do it?

					ESTES
			People say she was running around on
			him. People say he caught her in bed
			with other men. People say a lot of
			things.
				(beat)
			He disappeared, taking the two small
			ones with him. At least they were
			never found.

	The winding path leads to a small orchard. They hang on his every
	word.

					ESTES (cont'd)
			We're here.

	In the center of the orchard is a cemetery.

	They move off the path into the safety of the woods. There seems to be
	activity around the place. It's silent and eerie.

	Julie stares, fascinated. She is slowly drawn toward the house. Karla
	grabs for her arm.

					KARLA
			Be careful, Julie.

					JULIE
			I've got to see.

	She leads, they follow, circling the house. Julie rounds a corner of
	the shack and stops. She sees --

	TWO TOMBSTONES

	The first stone reads: SARAH WILLIS (birth/death)

	The second stone reads: SUSIE WILLIS (birth/death)

	Beyond them

	A FRESHLY DUG GRAVE

	and the group moves slowly toward it. The headstone, partially
	obscured by the mound of dirt, comes into view.

	The third headstone reads:

					JULIE JAMES
				born September 6, 1979
				died July 4, 1998
					"A Lying Whore"

	"A Lying Whore" is scratched with a knife.

					KARLA
				(realizing)
			...Today's July fourth.

	Will goes to comfort Julie --

					JULIE
			I'm not dying on this island,
			Will.
				(louder)
			Do you hear me?

	Julie shouts into the darkness.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			You want me, Ben Willis? Come and
			get me. I'm right here.

	She kicks over her headstone --

					JULIE (cont'd)
			My grave stays empty!

	She looks defiantly down the path.

					KARLA
			Julie, the boats are gone, the
			phones are down. There's no way off
			this place.

					JULIE
			Then, we fight --

	Will looks around. Estes is gone.

					WILL
			Where'd Estes go?

					TYRELL
			What is up with that weirdo?

					WILL
			I'll go find him.

					KARLA
			Why? He can't help us.

					WILL
			He's probably the only one who
			can help us.

					TYRELL
			I'll come with you.

					KARLA
			Are you crazy? We're not staying
			here on our own.

					WILL
			It's okay. He couldn't have gone
			far. I'll catch up with you later.

	Will disappears into the darkness.

					KARLA
			Maybe we should just wait here?
			Hide in a tree?

					TYRELL
			I'm not hiding up no tree.
				(to Julie)
			I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves
			to the teeth and kick this psycho's
			butt.

									CUT TO:

69	INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT

	They move cautiously into the kitchen. Blue emergency lights flicker
	above them. It's a big room with plenty of nooks and crannies for
	somebody to be hiding in.

	Tyrell picks up a couple of different knives. He hefts them in his
	hand.

					TYRELL
			What I need is a gun. Not a steak
			knife.

	Karla grabs a paring knife --

					TYRELL (cont'd)
			You gonna clean vegetables? You
			gonna stir-fry? You need something
			that'll get his attention.

	He picks up a huge butcher's knife and cuts the air with it. He then
	roughly empties other drawers looking for more weapons.

	Karla looks to Julie, something on her mind. Julie catches the look.

					KARLA
				(hurt)
			I'm your best friend...You could
			have told me the truth about what
			happened. I would've understood.

					JULIE
				(sad)
			Karla, I just wanted the whole thing
			to be over. I didn't want to involve
			anybody else.

					KARLA
			It's too late for that.

	Julie steps over to Karla.

					JULIE
			I'm so sorry. I brought this on
			everyone. It's my fault.

	Tyrell picks up on the mood swing. He moves closer to them. He's
	sympathetic.

					TYRELL
			Forget that. You didn't do nothing.
			This fisherman's a piece of scum.
				(hard for him to admit)
			I should've been listening to you...
			I'm sorry.

	Julie smiles for a second.

					TYRELL (cont'd)
			Now, let's take a look at the
			pantry.

					KARLA
			You think that's a good place to
			hide?

					TYRELL
			I don't know, but I'm starving.

									CUT TO:

70	EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

	Will runs from the trees and finds himself by an old house. He sees
	Estes by the ocean, near a boat.

					WILL
			Hey Estes.
				(beat)
			Estes? Where'd you go?

	Estes doesn't answer right away -- he keeps his back to Will.

					WILL (cont'd)
			You abandoning us? How come you
			didn't tell us you had a boat?

	Estes picks up the boat's oar. He speaks low, almost inaudibly.

					ESTES
			This has to end. Now.

					WILL
			What -- ?

	Estes swings the oar, cracking Will's head hard.

									SMASH CUT TO:

71	INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Tyrell, Julie, and Karla approach the pantry -- a huge steel door.

72	INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

	Tyrell steps inside.

					TYRELL
			Steel door...Food...Perfect.

	He starts looking for something to eat --

	CLANK. There's a soft CLATTERING from somewhere in the room. Everyone
	freezes, staring into the darkness.

	Tyrell puts a finger to his lips, then creeps down an aisle,
	listening. There's nothing but SILENCE.

	He moves toward the first aisle...He jumps out. The aisle is empty.

	JULIE AND KARLA

	move down an aisle behind him.

	Tyrell ducks around to the second aisle. He slices the air, ready to
	pounce. This aisle is empty.

	JULIE AND KARLA

	nervously move another aisle down.

	Tyrell moves stealthily toward the third aisle...This is it. He lunges
	forward into the row...Empty, also.

	There's a small SOUND...A MOUSE scampers off under the shelves. Tyrell
	turns and smiles at Karla and Julie --

					TYRELL
			It's just a --

	A ROLLING PIN

	bashes him on the back of the head. Tyrell hits the floor,
	unconscious.

	JULIE AND KARLA SCREAM

					KARLA
			Ty!

	A DARK FIGURE jumps down from the shelves. Tyrell puts his arms up --

					TYRELL
				(yelling for mercy)
			Don't kill me --

					JULIE
			Wait, it's Nancy --

	Nancy, the bartender steps out of the shadows brandishing her rolling
	pin.

									CUT TO:

73	INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Tyrell stands at the sink, where Karla holds a towel full of ice to
	his head. Nancy, the bartender, looks on apologetically.

					NANCY
			I'm sorry, but you could've been
			the one doing all of this --

					TYRELL
			And so could you -- crazy fool.

					NANCY
			You stumbled into my hiding place.

					TYRELL
			Must have missed the sign.

					NANCY
			Excuse me, but this island didn't
			have a murder rate until you people
			showed up.
				(chilled)
			I've never seen a dead body before.

					JULIE
			Get used to it.

					NANCY
			Who's doing this?

					TYRELL
				(friendly)
			Don't even get her started...It's a
			long, long story and you probably
			wouldn't believe a word of it.

	Tyrell moves as he talks, fed up and exhasted. He crosses past the
	stove and under a huge hanging rack of pots and pans.

					TYRELL (cont'd)
			I mean, all I know for sure is this
			is the worst vacation of my life...
			I'm tired, and I'm hungry, and I
			personally haven't seen one damn
			psycho killer...

	THWACK! A STEEL HOOK

	sinks deep into the base of Tyrell's shaved skull, a look of abject
	surprise on his face.

	The women freeze as Tyrell dances like a marionette before being
	hoisted up and hung on the rack like a used saucepan.

	THE FISHERMAN

	is in the vent above the stove. He stares out at them from the hood of
	his slicker.

	Ben jumps from the range onto the floor. Karla is in shock. Julie
	yanks her and they flee.

	As she goes, Julie picks up

	A LOOSE KNIFE

	and hides it in her back pocket.

									CUT TO:

74	EXT. OFFSHORE ON FERRY - NIGHT

	Ray pilots the boat through the dark, choppy water. He's navigating by
	compass, maps spread before him. He sees something off the bow --

	A BOAT

	drifting on the fast sea. The words "Tower Bay" are painted on the
	side. Ray pulls alongside and discovers the boat is empty.

	He reaches for the radio.

					RAY
				(into radio)
			Come in...This is Summer Breeze
			requesting emergency assistance for
			Tower Bay island. I repeat...This
			is Summer Breeze...

	Ray guns the boat away.

									SMASH CUT TO:

75	INT. HOTEL FOYER - NIGHT

	Julie, Karla, and Nancy run into the lobby. The storm is WAILING
	outside the front doors.

	They pause for a second. Behind them we hear the rapid THUD-THUD-THUD
	of Ben's boots.

	Nancy goes straight to a desk and pulls out a flashlight. She points
	to the main staircase.

					NANCY
			I know where we can hide.

76	INT. HOTEL STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

	The women run up the stairs. Behind them, we hear Ben's FOOTFALLS
	echoing.

77	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

	On the top floor, they race toward the end of a dark hallway.

	At the far end of the hall, Nancy illuminates a section of the
	ceiling.

					NANCY
			Give me a boost up --

	Julie helps Nancy reach a pull cord in the ceiling.

	A WOODEN LADDER

	pulls down. Nancy quickly climbs up.

	BEN WILLIS

	enters the hallway and continues toward them.

	ON THE LADDER

	Karla slips, nearly knocking Julie to the floor. They both scramble
	upwards --

	Ben hits the ladder --

	Just as Julie reaches the top rung she SCREAMS --

	BEN'S HOOK IS ON HER FOOT!

	Nancy appears in the opening and throws a brick down at Ben. It hits
	him in the chest and knocks him back.

	Julie makes it into the attic. They pull the ladder up behind them
	like a drawbridge.

78	INT. HOTEL ATTIC - NIGHT

	Julie, Karla, and Nancy surround the hatch they've just shut. They
	fumble with it --

					JULIE
			There's no way to lock it.

					KARLA
			What do we do?

	From below comes LAUGHTER. There's a tug on the hatch, cracking it
	open. The girls pull it back shut, but it's hard to get a grip.

	There's more tugging, the hatch bending down; they can see Ben. Then,
	the rope SNAPS. The hatch slams shut.

					NANCY
			There's no way to grip this thing.

	Suddenly the STEEL TIP of the HOOK pokes through the crack...It
	wriggles around...Turning...And begins to pull the hatch down.

	They try to hold it...But it's no use. They let go and jump away.

	The attic is lit by a cathedral window. It's crosshatched with wooden
	beams and pink insulation.

					NANCY
			Watch your step...

	THUNK! Karla's foot goes through a gap between two beams.

									SMASH CUT TO:

79	INT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

	KARLA'S FOOT

	dangles through the ceiling.

									SMASH BACK TO:

80	INT. HOTEL ATTIC - NIGHT

	Julie helps Karla back up onto a beam.

					NANCY (cont'd)
			Stay on the beams!

	Karla and Julie follow her precarious progress.

	Ben climbs off the ladder to a beam. He watches them leap from beam to
	beam. His hook glints in the light.

	Julie, Karla, and Nancy move toward the cathedral window. They turn.
	They are cut off. They spread out against the wall looking for an
	opening to get back to the hatch.

	Ben feints toward Nancy then swipes at Julie --

	He misses. She leaps away. She looks down. Instead of insulation, she
	sees a

	WINDOW INTO THE HONEYMOON SUITE

	She sees her bed through a one-way mirror. Julie stares, momentarily
	transfixed. Karla is edging her way around the side of Ben.

					BEN
				(re: the mirror)
			You'd be amazed by what you'd see.
			My wife with every man on the
			island, for example.
				(to Julie)
			And you, sexy...I loved watching you.

					JULIE
			You sick freak.

	Ben suddenly whirls and lunges at Karla. He grabs her, but they both
	lose their balance, teetering for a moment on one of the beams, before
	falling --

	They CRASH through the mirror --

81	INT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Karla and Ben hit the bed in a rain of glass.

	Karla bounces to her feet and dives out of the way as Ben swings his
	hook.

82	EXT. ROOM BALCONY - NIGHT

	Karla backs onto the porch. She backs up against the railing.

									CUT TO:

83	EXT. ATTIC WINDOW - NIGHT

	Julie and Nancy reach the CATHEDRAL WINDOW. They open it and look out.

84	EXT. ROOM BALCONY - JULIE'S POV - NIGHT

	and Ben advancing toward Karla, whose back is against the railing.

	Karla looks behind her, sees

	THE GLASS ROOF OF THE ORCHID HOUSE

	which doesn't look nealy strong enough to suppor her.

	Ben advances, swining the hook. Karla leaps over the railing and onto
	the glass.

85	EXT. GREENHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT

	Karla keeps a wary eye on Ben as she gingerly backs up on the glass.
	The GLASS begins CRACKING, subtle crack lines splintering out from her
	footsteps.

	Ben lunges and swipes at her with his hook.

	Karla leans away from the attack and loses her balance, slipping onto
	her back on the glass.

	She lifts her head. Starts to move...CRACK. The glass is fracuring
	beneath her. She looks through the glass.

	KARLA'S POV - THE ORCHIDS BELOW

	She tries to slide toward a support...The glass CREAKS and MOANS as
	she moves across the room.

					KARLA
				(to herself)
			Oh, god, no --

	She's almost to the support when

	THE ROOF EXPLODES

	taking Karla down into the orchid house.

86	INT. ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT

	The roof shatters in an explosion of flying glass.

	Karla land on her back.

	She's unconsious --

									CUT TO:

87	INT. ATTIC WINDOW - NIGHT

	Julie and Nancy look at the empty space which once was a roof
	supporting Karla --

					JULIE
				(screaming)
			Karla!

	Ben turns and looks up at Nancy and Julie. Then, he sprints from the
	balcony.

	Julie and Nancy duck back into the attic.

									CUT TO:

88	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

	Julie and Nancy climb down into the hallway. They are cautious,
	expecting Ben at every turn.

89	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	They hurry across the lobby.

									CUT TO:

90	INT. ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT

	A sprawling, steam-filled room, dense with vegetation of all sorts and
	shelf after shelf of beautiful orchids.

	Karla lies unconscious. Slowly, she opens her eyes.

	There's a rustling in the flowers. She tries to get up, but can't yet.
	She waits in terror as

	BIRDS

	fly up and out of the hole she's made in the roof.

	Karla tries to stand and her leg gives way. She tests her knee --

					KARLA
			Oww...

	Karla starts hobbling. She reaches the door -- it's locked from the
	other side.

	There is a thick glass window set in the middle of the door.

	The cranes startle again, something upsetting them. Karla spins to
	look. Nothing.

									CUT TO:

91	INT. HOTEL/ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT

	Julie and Nancy arrive at the door. Karla pounds on the other side --
	points to the lock.

					KARLA
			It's locked!

	Nancy sees a KEY RING by the door.

					NANCY
			It's gotta be one of these.

	Nancy tries the first of many keys. Something catches Julie's eye. She
	moves in for a closer look. Her eyes go wide --

	ORCHID HOUSE - JULIE'S POV

	A powerful BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks. Fills the room with a pulse of
	bright light. BEN IS STANDING INSIDE AND HE'S HEADING STRAIGHT FOR
	KARLA.

					JULIE
				(terrified)
			He's inside.

	Karla spins. Sees him. Her terrified scream blends with the cranes,
	now SHRIEKING VIOLENTLY.

					KARLA
			Please! Hurry!

92	INT. HOTEL/ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT

	Nancy fumbles with the keys. Drops them. Julie tries to keep calm.

					JULIE
			Come on...

93	INT. HOTEL/ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT

	Ben closes fast, slicing the tops off orchids as he goes. He skewers a
	bud on the tip of his hook.

	Karla pounds on the door.

					KARLA
				(frantic)
			Hurry!

	Nancy fumbles for the right key but the lock is old.

					JULIE
			Nancy...

					NANCY
				(crying)
			It's jammed!

	The key is stuck.

					KARLA
				(through glass)
			Come on!!

	She's running out of time. Julie sees a FIRE AXE encased in the glass
	safety box.

					JULIE
				(determined)
			No way!!

	Julie smashes the glass with her elbow. Grabs the axe.

					JULIE
				(to Nancy)
			Move!

	Julie hammers the door with the axe. Wood splinters. Glass cracks.

	Ben is almost on top of Karla now.

	Julie swings. The axe breaks the glass, pulls the frame out. Julie
	drops the axe. They grab Karla. Pull her through.

	Ben swings. The hook rips Karla's shoe, but Julie and Nancy pull her
	through.

	Julie and Ben are face to face. Julie has the axe in her hands. She
	stares him down.

					JULIE
			Come on, gimme a shot --

	Ben rips off his hook, eyeing Julie.

					KARLA
				(shouting)
			Julie, come on.

	They flee. Ben tries the door, realizes it had locked behind him. He
	can't fit through the circular window. He throws his shoulder against
	the door. And again. And again.

	The door frame starts to give --

									CUT TO:

94	EXT. STORM SHELTER - NIGHT

	Julie, Karla, and Nancy approach the iron door to the underground
	storm cellar. Julie carries the axe.

					NANCY
			It's over there.

	They struggle together to open the heavy door.

95	INT. STORM SHELTER - NIGHT

	Stairs lead down into darkness. Karla hesitates --

					KARLA
			I don't know...

					JULIE
			Come on, you can make it.

	Julie gets in, pulling Karla in behind her. They pull the door closed
	behind them.

					NANCY
			There's a light somewhere.

96	INT. STORM SHELTER - NIGHT

	The darkness is complete. We hear MOVEMENT.

					KARLA
			Julie?

					JULIE
			I'm right here. Grab my hand.

					NANCY
			This place has emergency power.
			Just ease you way down the stairs
			and I'll find the light.

					JULIE
			Okay. I'm at the bottom. Karla,
			just get my hand.

					KARLA
			I'm holding your hand!

					JULIE
			No, you're not.

					KARLA
			...Nancy?

	Nancy pulls the chain on an overhead bulb. The lights go on,
	illuminating

	THE DEAD CORPSES

	of Brooks, Derrick, Olga, and Titus -- whose hand Karla is holding.
	The women SCREAM!

	They muddle together, trying to collect themselves.

	Suddenly, there is a POUNDING on the iron door. They SCREAM.

	Then, Julie remembers the axe. She motions the others to stay back --

					JULIE
			All right --

	The iron hatch is slowly opening. Julie gets the axe into possition --

	WILL

	pokes his head through. He's clutching a piece of wood as a weapon.

					WILL
			It's you guys, thank god. Is
			everyone okay?

	They are ecstatic to see him. They bound up the concrete stairs --

					KARLA
			Help's here. Help's here.

97	EXT. HOTEL WALKWAY - NIGHT

	Will is already on the move toward the hotel.

					WILL
			Come on. We're gonna be okay.

					JULIE
			Did you get help?

	Will shakes his head. He's walking woozily.

					JULIE (cont'd)
			What happened?

					WILL
			Estes came after me with a gaffing
			hook.

					JULIE
			He's in it with Willis?

					WILL
			I guess so.

	Julie points out that his chest and stomach are covered in blood, too.

					JULIE
			Your stomach, you're hurt --

	Will looks down, clutches himself, and keeps moving.

					WILL
			When I was coming back I saw your
			slicker friend looking for you guys
			down by the water.
				(beat)
			Let's hurry and get inside...

									CUT TO:

98	EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

	Ray guns the boat straight up onto the beach. He leaps from the boat.

									CUT TO:

99	INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

	Will slumps down on the bar floor. He's floating in and out of
	consciousness. Julie leans over him, concerned.

					JULIE
			Oh, my god, you're bleeding to
			death.

	She looks back towards Nancy --

					JULIE (cont'd)
			We need a first-aid kit.

					NANCY
				(already moving)
			I saw one in the lobby.

	Karla starts, then hesitates. Will moans, looks at her.

					NANCY (cont'd)
			I'll come with you.

					WILL
			You'll be okay. It's over.

	Karla and Nancy rush from the bar. Julie looks tenderly at Will. He
	looks back at her. She pulls some hair off his forehead. He smiles
	weakly.

					JULIE
			Will, just hold on. We'll get you
			fixed up.

									CUT TO:

100	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Karla and Nancy go to the area near the check-in and behind the desk.

					NANCY
			Look up there. I'll look over here.

	Karla looks behind the desk. Nancy is searching the shelves.

									CUT TO:

101	INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

	Julie tenderly searches the area around Will's stomach. She's fussing
	with the clothes, looking for the wound.

					JULIE
			You've got blood everywhere, but I
			can't find the wound.

	Will takes her head in his hands, looks her in the eye.

					WILL
			That's because it's not my blood.

	The slow change in Julie as she realizes...

	She starts to run. Will roughly grabs her.

					WILL (cont'd)
			It's time you woke up, Julie.

	His voice switches to that of a familiar radio disk jockey.

					WILL (cont'd)
				(as Mark in the Morning)
			AND START CONTEMPLATING THE ULTIMATE
			MAGIC GETAWAY!

	He drags her out of the bar.

									CUT TO:

102	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

	Nancy sees a white metal box sitting on a shelf. She reaches for it...
	It's a first aid kit.

	ANOTHER HAND

	reaches over and lands on top of her hand. She jumps and sees Estes
	right behind her. Karla SCREAMS.

					ESTES
			Will...He's in on it. He's --

	Suddenly Estes's expression changes to surprise, and

	A SPEAR TIP

	appears in the front of his chest.

	Nancy screams and looks over Estes's shoulder to see

	BEN WILLIS

	standing there holding a spear gun.

	Estes topples over on top of Nancy, pinning her underneath his dying,
	convulsing body. Nancy struggles to get loose.

					NANCY
			Help me.

	Karla rushes to Nancy. She tugs on her arm, trying to pull her free.

	The fisherman strides toward them. He raises his hook. He swings at
	Karla's head.

	THE HOOK CATCHES

	on a beam. Karla struggle with Nancy.

					KARLA
			Come on, come on.

	Ben tries to free his hook hand. Karla looks up at him. He calmly puts
	his foot onto Estes's back and steps down with all of his weight,
	driving

	THE SPEAR TIP

	deep into Nancy who expires with a sigh.

					KARLA (cont'd)
			Damn you.

	Karla, blind with rage, attacks the fisherman. He kicks out with a
	boot and sends Karla fying onto

	A GLASS TABLE

	in the lobby area. The table explodes. Karla is finished.

	The fisherman works his hook free from the post. Karla is unmoving and
	looks quite dead.

									CUT TO:

103	EXT. WOOD TRAIL - NIGHT

	Will pulls Julie along a muddy path in the rain. He's got her by the
	hair. She's slipping and falling.

					WILL
			Look at the bright side, Jules. We
			finally get to spend some quality
			time together.

	Julie's trying to get to the knife she's stashed in her back pocket.

					JULIE
			Why are you doing this to me?

					WILL
			Me, me, me. It's always about you.
			I'm having bad dreams. I can't
			sleep. I'm not doing well in school.
			I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.

					JULIE
			I trusted you.

					WILL
			We had a connection, didn't we? I
			can tell you one thing, though. Ray
			didn't trust me. He was right. He's
			dead, but he was right.

	They come into the orchard. They are covered in mud. Julie stumbles
	again. Goes to her knees. Works the knife free and slashes up at Will.
	She slices him across the face.

	He steps back, feels the blood.

					WILL (cont'd)
			What'd you have to do that for?

	There is a creepy pause. Will stares at his own blood. She catches her
	breath...

	Then suddenly, Will knocks the knife from her hand. He lifts her by
	the hair. Enraged, he puches her in the face. She goes down.

									CUT TO:

104	EXT. ORCHARD - NIGHT

	Will has Julie in a choke hold. He drags her toward the open graves.
	Julie is losing energy, slowly giving up.

					JULIE
			...Why?

					WILL
			Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll
			get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.

	He shoves her. She falls backward into the arms of Ben Willis.

					WILL (cont'd)
			Hi, Dad.

	Julie WAILS, struggling wildly in Ben's grasp.

					JULIE
			OMIGOD --

					BEN
			That's my boy.

	Ben holds her back to look at her. He throws back the hood of his
	slicker. We see his face clearly for the first time.

					JULIE
			No, no, no --

	Ben pulls off his hook and strokes Julie's cheek with his stump.

					BEN
			Shush, now. No more screaming...No
			more running. Time to die.

					RAY (v.o.)
			Let go of her! Now!

	Ben and Will spin to see

	RAY

	like the hero from a western, step out from behind a tree.

	Ben starts to laugh. Will joins him.

					WILL
			You gotta be kiddin' me.

					BEN
			What're you gonna do, boy? Call
			us names?

					RAY
			Let her go. Now.

	Ray raises the .38 caliber handgun. He COCKS the hammer.

	Ben doesn't let go of Julie. Lightning fast, he slaps his hook back on
	and gets the point to Julie's neck.

					BEN
			Think about it, boy. You're no
			killer.
				(beat)
			That's my job.

	Ray hesitates, his finger on the trigger. He does look scared.

	Ben takes a step toward Ray. Then another, pushing Julie in front of
	him. Will moves closer, too.

					RAY
			Stop right there.

	Ray's finger squeezing down the trigger.

					BEN
			You don't have it in you.

	Suddenly, Will dives for Ray. Ray gets a shot off, tagging Ben in the
	shoulder. The gun goes flying.

	Julie spins and hits Ben in the face. He knocks her into her own
	grave...Mud begins to slide in on her. She tries to scramble out.

	Will and Ray wrestle, punching each other repeatedly in the face.

	Will has Ray down and his hands around his kneck. He looks him in the
	eye.

					WILL
			We haven't missed you down here,
			Ray boy. I got to know Julie real
			well.

	Will gets the better of Ray. He's stronger. He yanks him up -- choking
	him. Ray is begging to check out.

					WILL (cont'd)
			Think of all the things I'm gonna
			do to her.
				(beat)
			Dad, finish him.

	Ben charges toward Ray's back. He pulls back the hook for a roundhouse
	slashing --

	At the last second, Ray dips, elbows Will.

	THE HOOK

	goes straight into Will's chest.

	The fisherman has hooked his own son.

	Father and son make final eye contact, the son's eyes go blank.

	Ben stares in shock as Will expires, falling back into the mud.

	Ben SCREAMS in rage. Ray is tired.

	THWACK. Ben begins beating Ray. He puches him. He straight-arms him
	with the hook. He knocks him again and again and Ray is beaten, giving
	up...

	Ben has Ray against a tombstone. The hook slowly inches toward his
	eye.

					BEN
			Gonna blind you first.

	The hook is touching the eyelid --

	A GUNSHOT

	rings out. A look of wonder crosses Ben's face. He slowly turns away
	from Ray.

	JULIE

	stands behind him holding the gun.

					JULIE
			Just...Die.

	BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. She empties the gun into Ben, who flies backward
	into Julie's grave.

	As he tumbles, Ben releases the dirt stacked beside the grave...

	A MUDDY LANDSLIDE

	slowly covers Ben up.

	Ben's face is covering over. His mouth starting to fill with dirt --

					BEN
			You can't kill me.

	His face is completely covered. His mouth still moving.

					BEN (cont'd)
			I'll always be with you.

	The dirt covers him. It continues to fill, until just the

	GLEAMING METAL HOOK

	waves futilely out of the dirt. Then, is stops wiggling.

	Julie goes to Ray.

									CUT TO:

105	EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

	Ray and Julie limp across the grounds of the hotel. They are moving
	past some shrubbery when

	A DARK FIGURE

	jumps out. Julie yells. She and Ray jump back.

	KARLA

	stops in the middle of her kamikaze attack, knife held out.

					KARLA
			Oh, god, it's you --

					JULIE
			You're okay. Thank god.

					KARLA
			Is he?

	They nod. They go to her -- jubilant group hug time. They compose
	themselves.

					KARLA (cont'd)
			You know, it's true what they say
			about package vacations...You get
			what you pay for.
				(beat)
			Now, how about we get off this piece
			of crap island.

	The first rays of the morning sun appear. Ray looks adoringly at Julie
	as the beautific light catches her face.

	Ray kisses her. She kisses him back. They are silhouetted against a
	beautiful orange sunrise.

					JULIE
				(smiling)
			We don't have to tell anyone it
			rained the whole time. It can just
			be our little secret.

	The three of them throw their arms around each other's shoulders and
	they start walking for the beach as...

	A COAST GUARD HELICOPTER

	rises into view.

									MATCH CUT TO:

106	EXT. HOUSE - DAY

	Establish. The sun setting over a quaint street in a college town.

	SUPERTITLE:			FOUR MONTHS LATER

	Julie pedals her bicycle down the street. She has a book bag over her
	shoulder. It feels like one of the first days of school.

	She rides the bike up to a small house on the perfect street. She
	rolls the bike right up to the front door.

									CUT TO:

107	INT. HOUSE - DAY

	Julie lets herself into the house. She leans her bike against another
	bike in the hallway.

	It's a perfect day. Birds CHIRPING. WIND in the willows. There's
	another NOISE...from inside her house.

	She goes perfectly still. And listens. Behind her, by the kitchen, the
	shadow of a FIGURE moves. She whirls.

	NOTHING

	She creeps down the hallway toward her kitchen. She pauses --

	The dark figure almost knocks into her. She SCREAMS.

	It's Ray. He's holding a disemboweled toaster.

					JULIE
			Ray...what are you doing?

					RAY
				(toaster)
			Oh...it's not working right.
			You're home early.
				(sees she's shaken)
			Did I scare you?

					JULIE
			Never do that again.

					RAY
				(tender)
			Hey -- I didn't know you were here.
			It's okay.
				(beat)
			We got the refrigerator in. Come
			see.

	She sees the love in his eyes. She hugs him.

					JULIE
			I love it here.

					RAY
			It's gonna be great.

									DISSOLVE TO:

107A	INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT

	Julie climbs to the top of the stairs. She passes Ray in the bathroom.
	She pauses in the doorway --

107B	INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Ray is at the sink in boxer shorts. He's using an electric Waterpic
	devicice that has just been opened, a gift from the party. It makes a
	low WHIRRING sound.

					RAY
				(seeing her)
			Checking the locks again?

					JULIE
			You know me to well.

	Julie smile and walks to the bedroom.

									CUT TO:

107C	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Julie climbs into bed with a book. The bedroom is clean and orderly.
	The windows are closed. The closet door is shut.

	The room is decorated simply: a high antique bed; unopened boxes; a
	highboy; an antique mirror leaning against the wall. A stuffed bear
	sits in a chair.

	There is a CLATTER from another room. Julie freezes. She waits. She
	hears it again. She climbs out of bed.

									CUT TO:

107D	INT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Julie walks into the dark spare bedroom. The CLATTERING SOUND comes
	from the open window. The wind is blowing the blinds.

	Julie relaxes. She shuts the window. As she leaves the room, we notice
	the dirty imprint of a boot below the window.

107E	INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Julie passes Ray who is still absorbed with the new toy.

	Behind him, the door softly closes. The lock twists. Ray is oblivious,
	happy being the dental-hygene pacesetter of the household.

107F	INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Julie enters the room. She looks at the closet door. It is open a
	crack. She hesitates, trying to remember if it was open before -- it
	wasn't.

	Julie approaches the closet. She catches her refelction in the mirror
	next to the closet. She peers into the crack of the closet. She can't
	see anything. She throws open the closet door.

	NOTHING

	She looks around the room.

					JULIE
			What is my problem?

	She sits down on the bed.

	We see her bare feet from under the bed.

	She smiles, relaxes. She looks in the mirror leaning against the wall.
	Something has caught her eye. She freezes. She turns slowly back to
	the reflection in the mirror. She sees the glint of steel --

	A HOOK -- CRASH ZOOM INTO REFLECTION --

	THE FISHERMAN CROUCHING UNDER HER BED

	Julie turns too late --

	The fisherman lunges out and grabs her legs. Julie screams. She goes
	down --

	Her nails scrape into the wooden floor as she is dragged under the
	bed.

          The universe is deathless;

          it stays infinite.
          A sound man by not advancing himself stays the further ahead

          sustains himself outside himself.

          INT. DARKENED BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A spherical black monolith rises up from a white surface...
          white like the moon.
                         
          In the darkness, the towers metal skin is barely visible.
                         
          We ROTATE AROUND, revealing the tower to actually be a LAMP --
          not rising up from a surface, but hanging down from a white
          ceiling. The bulb unlit.
                         
          Directly below the lamp is the very definition of innocence -
          a sleeping child. Chest rising and falling with each breath.
                         
          We HOVER over the young boy...watching him. A blanket
          emblazoned with dinosaurs is draped across his limbs. His
          mouth is slack, eyelids twitching to dreams unseen.
                         
          The truly deep sleep that an adult can only wish for.
                         
          We move away from him, exploring the dark room. Strewn with
          toys. The door is slightly ajar. We float through it into--
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --a long hallway. Even darker than the bedroom. And without
          the boys rhythmic breathing, even quieter.
                         
          A window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach.
                         
          Someone is standing in front of it.
                         
          The murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away. We
          follow it, tentative. Turning a corner, we see the figure.
          Standing in a doorway.
                         
          Now we can make out the edges of the person. It is an old
          woman. Hair in a Victorian bun. A corseted dress.
                         
          She stares at us.
                         
                          WOMAN
           Let me in.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Eyes flick open.
                         
          A woman blinks awake, gazing around the room. Another
          bedroom. Sparse. Just a bed and a cabinet. It is 5.43 AM.
                         
          Her eyes settle on the man lying next to her in the dark. His
          heaving snores have woken her up.
                         
          She is RENAI (pronounced Renee) LAMBERT (36). With a quiet
          determination she is holding on to her youthful good looks,
          but the lines of age are creeping in.
                         
          She has settled into the `comfort' years of a marriage: hair
          pinned up messily, wearing dowdy pajamas.
                         
          She beholds her husband, taking him in. Considering him. He
          snorts and smacks his lips. Very unflattering.
                         
          She climbs out of bed.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          High ceilings. Exposed beams. Spanish style windows.
                         
          Renai treads across wooden floorboards into a sunken living
          room. No matter careful she is, there is a loud creak with
          each step. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK in the corner ticks steadily.
                         
          There is barely any furniture in here, only a BOOKCASE and a
          PIANO. What there is a lot of...is boxes. Large moving boxes.
                         
          Renai plops cross-legged onto the floor and rips open one of
          the boxes, marked BOOKS. She plucks out a handful of books
          and lines them up on the bookshelf. Then another handful.
                         
          They are all self-help and self-improvement books. Titles
          like `Be The Better You' and `Inch By Inch, It's A Cinch: A
          Guide To Achieving Your Goals' pop out.
                         
          She spots a sealed box labelled PHOTO ALBUMS. She strips away
          the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos.
                         
          Smiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages. The
          happy couple. Young. Glowing. Sadness washes over her.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Mom?
                         
          She snaps out of it and turns to see DALTON LAMBERT (8). Her
          son. He approaches her, rubbing his eyes. (It is not the boy
          we saw in the opening scene.)
           4.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           What are you doing up, kiddo?
                         
                          DALTON
           I don't like my room.
                         
                          RENAI
           You'll get used to it. It's only
           your first night.
                         
          He climbs into her lap. She bites on his ear playfully.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Argh, I'm going to eat you.
                         
                          DALTON
           What are you looking at?
                         
                          RENAI
           Just some photos.
                         
                          DALTON
           What photos?
                         
          She hefts another album from the box, prying it open. A photo
          of a grinning young girl greets them, hair in pigtails.
                         
                          RENAI
           Do you know who that is?
                         
                          DALTON
           No.
                         
                          RENAI
           That's me.
                         
                          DALTON
           It doesn't look like you.
                         
                          RENAI
           I know. I'm so happy there. But
           it's me. When I was your age. I was
           a kid once too, you know.
                         
                          DALTON
           No, you weren't.
                         
          Renai bursts out laughing. She is famous for her big laugh.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thanks. Maybe you're right...I don't
           remember being this person at all.
           I hope she smiled like that all the
           time, whoever she was.
           5.
                         
                         
          She sizes up her son. The living embodiment of the photo.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           This is a terrible thing to admit,
           Dalton, but sometimes I get jealous of
           you. That you're so young. That you
           haven't made any of your decisions yet.
                         
                          DALTON
           I don't wanna grow old.
                         
                          RENAI
           Well, it starts happening to us
           from the moment we're born.
                         
          She points to the hands on the grandfather clock.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Every time that clock ticks, we all
           get a little bit older.
                         
          She turns the page in the photo album, seeing an old man.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           That's your grandpa. You wouldn't
           remember him.
                         
                          DALTON
           He smells like smoke.
                         
                          RENAI
           Yeah...good memory. He did smoke
           that god awful pipe, didn't he?
                         
                          DALTON
           Show me a picture of dad when he
           was a little kid.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't even know if we have any.
           He's hopeless with keeping photos.
                         
                          DALTON
           Show me a picture of me when I was
           a little kid.
                         
                          RENAI
           Your pictures are all in the computer.
           Nobody keeps photo albums like this
           anymore, they're ancient relics. They
           should. I like being able to touch
           something, instead of it floating
           around in cyber world. If the laptop
           breaks, your whole existence is erased.
           6.
                         
                         
                          DALTON
           What was I like when I was a little kid?
                         
                          RENAI
           You are a little kid.
                         
          She kisses him on the forehead and stares into his eyes.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           If only you knew what I know.
                         
          We hear a baby crying off screen.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           You certainly didn't cry as much as
           your little sister does. Come on.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, LAMBERT HOME - MORNING
                         
          Chaos.
                         
          Boxes of dinnerware have not been unpacked yet and it is
          turning the usual morning routine into a nightmare.
                         
          Renai is on the phone as her kids buzz around a kitchen island
          at top speed, creating a high-energy, manic pace in the room.
                         
                          RENAI

           Billing department.
                         
          Her son FOSTER (6), tugs on her leg, holding a box of cereal.
                         
                          FOSTER
           I need a bowl, mom.
                         
          Renai rips open a box, rifling through newspaper, phone
          wedged against her shoulder. She holds out a cup, flustered.
                         
                          RENAI
           Billing department.
                         
                          FOSTER
           It's too small.
                         
                          RENAI
           Make it work.

          Foster slumps on the floor, pouring cereal and overflowing milk
          into the cup. A baby girl in a high chair, CALI (2), squeals.
           7.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, LAMBERT HOME - MORNING
                         
          JOSH LAMBERT (37) gapes into the mirror, face covered in
          soap.
                         
          He washes it off. Now he's awake we see that he is a handsome,
          clean-cut guy - a former high school nerd who got revenge by
          growing into his body.
                         
          He sorts through a box labelled JOSH'S BATHROOM STUFF.
                         
          He takes out two bottles - TONER and MOISTURIZER. He dabs the
          toner on, then smooths the moisturizer into his forehead and
          around his eyes.
                         
          He suddenly notices a grey hair. Looks mortified.
                         
                          JOSH
           (Michael Corleone voice)
           Every time I think I've pulled you
           out...you grow back in.
                         
          He plucks it out, wincing melodramatically.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Ouch!
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, LAMBERT HOME - MORNING
                         
          Josh strides in, tie hanging open around his neck. Renai is
          still on the phone. Josh points to his tie.
                         
                          RENAI
           Well, I'd like to keep the old
           number if I could.
                          (TO JOSH)
           You really need to learn how to do
           this, honey.
                         
          She threads the tie into a knot for him.
                         
                          JOSH
                          (TO FOSTER)
           Don't eat on the floor, buddy.
                         
          Foster stays where he is, slurping cereal from the cup.
          Dalton is playing a handheld videogame. Intensely focused.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Okay, well, please let me know by
           the end of today, I have to give
           the number out. Thank you.
           8.
                         
                         
          She hangs up, pissed.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Foster, get up. Now.
                         
          Foster frowns and obeys.
                         
                          JOSH
                          (TO RENAI)
           How come you were up so early? Was
           Cali crying?
                         
                          RENAI
           You woke me up.
                         
                          JOSH
           What do you mean?
                         
                          RENAI
           You were snoring.
                         
                          JOSH
           No I wasn't.
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes you were.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't snore.
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes you do.
                         
                          JOSH
           My father snored. I do not snore.
                         
                          RENAI
           How would you know what you do?
           You're asleep.
                         
          Renai marches out of the room. Dalton's game unit beeps
          loudly and he pumps his fist.
                         
                          DALTON
           Yes! I made it to the last level!
           Invisiworld!
                         
          Ever amiable, Josh high five's his son.
                         
                          JOSH
           Good one, champ.
                          (BEAT)
           I don't snore, do I?
           9.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai sees that all the books she unpacked earlier are now
          scattered across the floor of the living room.
                         
                          RENAI
           Where are my bleeping pills?
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, LAMBERT HOME - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai charges in. Josh snatches an apple out of a fruit bowl,
          biting into it. He quickly gags and spits it out into the sink.
                         
                          JOSH
           What the heck is this? Wax?!
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes.
                         
                          JOSH
           Let me get this straight - we have
           no actual fruit but we have wax
           fruit?
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes.
                         
                          JOSH
           That is dangerous. It could kill
           one of our kids.
                         
                          RENAI
           Where are my pills, Josh?
                         
                          JOSH
           Probably where you left them,
           Renai.
                         
          She finds them on the counter, snatching them up.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           See.
                         
                          RENAI
           That's not where I left them.
                         
                          DALTON
           Mom, I need my lunch.
                         
                          RENAI
           Oh, geez. Look, just...take last
           night's dinner.
           10.
                         
                         
          She opens the fridge. It is bare except for a box of sushi.
                         
                          DALTON
           Sushi? Aw, that's weirdo food.
                         
                          RENAI
           It's all we have. Just for today,
           honey.
                         
                          JOSH
           Check it first, Dalton. It's
           probably made out of Styrofoam.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (TO DALTON)
           And while I've got you, if you're
           going to look at my books, please
           don't leave them all over the floor.
                         
                          DALTON
           I didn't touch your books.
                         
          Josh streaks past, kissing Renai on the cheek.
                         
                          JOSH
           I gotta go.
                         
                          RENAI
           Are you taking the boys to school?
                         
                          JOSH
           No time.
                         
                          RENAI
           Well can you pick them up after
           school?
                         
                          JOSH
           Not today.
                         
                          RENAI
           But I have stuff I wanted to...
                         
          She trails off. He's gone. Foster BURPS. Loudly.
                         
                          FOSTER
           Can I have another cup, mom?
                         
                         
          INT. CLASSROOM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Noisy students settle into their desks. Inner city kids,
          mostly Hispanic.
           11.
                         
                         
          Josh is their teacher, scribbling on the blackboard. One
          student, a lanky boy, ALANSO (16), hovers near the door.
                         
                          JOSH
           Alanso, please sit down.
                         
                          ALANSO
           No entiendo.
                         
                          JOSH
           Siéntate, por favor.
                         
          Alanso takes a seat. Josh is having trouble getting control.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Come on guys, quieten down.
                         
          A pretty girl in the front, TERI, is annoyed at the class.
                         
                          TERI
           You better all shut up.
                         
          She commands respect. They do. Except for one kid.
                         
           THE ONE KID
           Just cos you're in love.
                         
                          JOSH
           Thank you, Teri. Today we are going
           to talk about Darwin. It's a city in
           Australia, but it's also the last
           name of which famous naturalist?
                         
                          MALE STUDENT # 1
           Charles Darwin.
                         
                          JOSH
           Correct. Does anybody know what he
           is famous for?
                         
                          MALE STUDENT # 1
           He said that people descended from
           monkeys.
                         
                          JOSH
           Half right. He wrote a seminal book
           that explained his theories on
           natural selection, and how the
           different species on this planet -
           including humans - evolved.
                         
                          ALANSO
           I know I didn't evolve from no
           monkey. Shit.
           12.
                         
                         
          Everyone laughs.
                         
                          JOSH
           Humans actually have a lot in
           common with monkeys, or more
           specifically, chimpanzees.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Maybe you do, but I was created in
           the image of my Dios.
                         
          He takes a gold cross hanging on a necklace out of his shirt,
          kissing it and holding it up. That gets another laugh.
                         
                          JOSH
           I respect your right to believe
           that, Alanso. But I want to give
           you all possible theories. I want
           this class to go out into the world
           with an informed opinion.
                         
                          ALANSO
           The theory is incorrect, Mr. Lambert.
                         
                          JOSH
           How can it be incorrect? It's a
           theory. A scientific theory.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Yeah, well, science is bullshit. We
           didn't get here cos of no test-tubes.
                         
                          JOSH
           Alanso, if you keep talking like
           that I'm going to ask you to visit
           the principal.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Fine.
                         
          He gets up and leaves as the class JEERS and BOOS.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - DAY
                         
          Peace and quiet at last.
                         
          Renai gropes in behind the bookcase, plucking a hidden jewelry
          box free. She pinches a cigarette out of it and lights it.
                         
          She sits down at her piano, feeling the keys, warming her
          fingers up. Sunlight streams in through the windows.
                         
          She takes out a notebook, filled with scribbled handwriting.
           13.
                         
                         
          She places the notebook on the sheetstand, then sets a small,
          mechanical METRONOME in motion and begins tapping out a sombre
          melody in time with it.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (SINGING)
           Yeah, I'm looking west, always been
           looking that way, gonna get it all
           happening, just can't do it today...
                         
          She stops and makes a note in her book. She starts over,
          rising to the emotion of the song. She's got a good voice.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
                          (SINGING)
           Yeah, I'm looking west, always been
           looking that way, I'm gonna be
           somebody, I just can't be her today--
                         
          She is interrupted by the tinny sound of a baby crying.
                         
          She stops playing and looks over at a baby monitor, the
          source of the noise.
                         
          Renai deflates, her shoulders sagging in defeat. She closes
          her notebook and leaves the room.
                         
                         
          INT. CALI'S NURSERY - DAY
                         
          Renai scoops up Cali, rocking her gently.
                         
          A scratching sound interrupts. Rough. Frantic. Like a dog
          pawing at something.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai steps into the hall, curious. She can still hear it.
          She follows the sound to a door. Grabs the door handle.
                         
          The sound abruptly ceases.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The door whines open and stabs a blade of light onto a set of
          stairs that descend into a gloomy basement.
                         
          Renai stands at the top of the stairs, squinting into the
          inky blackness, straining to see.
                         
          She reaches up and yanks a light chain, illuminating a bare
          bulb and throwing light across the tenebrous space.
           14.
                         
                         
          The basement is large and completely bare. Cleaned out.
                         
          Renai takes a step down. She is still carrying Cali.
                         
          FURTHER DOWN below her, we see that there is one step that is
          cracked and broken.
                         
          She takes another step. The broken step is right below her now.
                         
          One more step and she will fall.
                         
          Cali squeals happily. Renai pauses...then turns around,
          heading back up the stairs. Stops when she sees something.
                         
          DEEP, VIOLENT SCRATCH MARKS...running downwards on the inside
          of the door...as if someone were trying to claw their way out.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          A Spanish-style home. Very pretty. This is not the suburbs.
          More of an inner city neighborhood. There's history here.
                         
          Josh pulls into the driveway of his new house in his Subaru.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          The house almost looks liveable.
                         
          Foster is watching loud, zany cartoons on TV. Cali is in a
          high chair. Renai is folding boxes. She has unpacked most of
          the living room and is very tired.
                         
          Josh ambles in, sees the work Renai has done.
                         
                          JOSH
           Look at this. Nice job.
                         
          Foster bolts over and crashes into his dads legs, hugging him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Whoa, buddy. Slow down.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh, where's the box of my lamps?
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't know. They should be here.
           We packed them up.
                         
                          RENAI
           Yeah, I packed them. They're not here.
           15.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           I remember the movers bringing them
           in and putting them right there.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE)
           Well, they're not here. I would
           know, I've been unpacking this
           stuff all day.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton wanders the hall, sporting a red superhero CAPE and
          carrying a plastic, glowing light-sabre toy.
                         
          He reaches a door. The basement door. He pulls it open.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton holds up his light-sabre, the glow allowing him to
          make out the murky corners of the basement below.
                         
          He takes a step down the stairs. Then another step.
                         
          The broken step is right below him.
                         
          He steps again --
                         
          -- and falls. Flails forward, tumbling down the steps, all
          the way to the bottom. His light sabre SHATTERS.
                         
          He hits the ground, his head smacking the floor.
                         
          All is dark.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Josh sits with Foster, zoned out in front of the droning TV.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Pitch black.
                         
          Dazed, Dalton sits up. His head is cut and bleeding. He is
          alone in the dark. He stares into the corner of the
          surrounding cell.
                         
          His eyes adjust, making out a shape.
                         
          A shadow.
           16.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
                         
          Josh and Renai look up as the quiet is shattered by a SCREAM.
                         
          They spring into action, scrambling to their feet.
                         
                          RENAI
           Dalton? Where are you?
                         
          He doesn't answer. Just keeps screaming.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Renai and Josh whip the door open, glaring into the basement
          from the top of the stairs.
                         
                          RENAI
           Dalton?
                         
          Dalton is crumpled at the bottom of the steps, sobbing, his
          red cape gathered around him.
                         
          Renai flicks the light on. Her and Josh scamper down the
          steps, propping Dalton up.
                         
                          JOSH
           What happened?
                         
                          DALTON
           I fell.
                         
                          RENAI
           Dalton, you have to be careful. You
           shouldn't be coming down here in
           the dark.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where do you hurt the most?
                         
                          DALTON
           My knee and my head. I can't stand
           up.
                         
          Josh lifts him to his feet. A severely grazed knee is dotted
          with blood. He's okay.
                         
                          JOSH
           You scared us, champ.
                         
          Josh carries him up the stairs as he sucks in sobs.
                         
          Renai glances around the basement, her eyes landing on the
          lone object that resides in it.
           17.
                         
                         
          She frowns. It wasn't there when she saw the basement last.
                         
          It is a box. One of her large, cardboard moving boxes.
                         
          It is marked LAMPS.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton is lying in bed, a band-aid slapped across his
          forehead. Renai tucks him in, Josh standing over him.
                         
                          JOSH
           You're lucky you don't need stitches.
                         
                          RENAI
           If I catch you falling down the
           stairs again I'm gonna break your
           neck.
                         
                          DALTON
           That doesn't make sense.
                         
          There are dozens of pictures tacked to the wall, all drawn by
          Dalton. Josh taps one; a drawing of Dalton flying through the
          night sky, wearing his cape.
                         
                          DALTON (CONT'D)
           You might be a superhero but you're
           not invincible. Be more careful, bud.
                         
          Renai kisses him and gets up.
                         
                          RENAI
           Sleep tight, honey.
                         
          They wave goodbye and turn out the light.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai flops into bed beside Josh, exhausted.
                         
                          JOSH
           We've gotta lock that door.
                         
                          RENAI
           He's such a boy. He goes off
           exploring. Sometimes I wanna keep
           him on one of those child leashes.
                         
                          JOSH
           Why bother with a child leash? I'll
           stop at the pet store tomorrow.
           18.
                         
                         
          She laughs and cuddles up to him, resting her head on his chest.
                         
                          RENAI
           I'm sorry I was pissy when you got
           home. I was trying to work on a
           song today and then Cali woke up
           and wouldn't stop crying...
                         
                          JOSH
           I didn't even notice.
                         
                          RENAI
           I feel guilty for wanting my own
           time.
                         
                          JOSH
           It's normal to want your own time.
                         
                          RENAI
           Is it? My mother gave up everything
           for me. I keep waiting for the
           completely selfless parent gene to
           kick in, but I'm exactly the same
           person I was when I was 22, only
           now I'm married with kids.
                         
                          JOSH
           You're a great mother.
                         
                          RENAI
           No, I'm not. They like you so much
           better than me.
                         
                          JOSH
           That's not true.
                         
                          RENAI
           You're the cool dad who comes home
           with presents and I'm the one who
           yells at them all day.
                         
                          JOSH
           Now you're being crazy. They love
           you. At least you get to connect
           with them. I work so much.
                         
                          RENAI
           Believe me, you're their hero. They
           try to play us off against each
           other. They're master manipulators.
           I guess they really are my kids.
                         
          Josh laughs. A lull settles over them.
           19.
                         
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Is this it, Josh?
                         
                          JOSH
           Is this so bad?
                         
          She doesn't answer. They sit in silence for a long beat.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thank you for letting me take some time
           off to work on my music again.
                         
                          JOSH
           We'll get by. I want you to do it.
                         
                          RENAI
           There's a couple of songs...I mean
           not all of them, but there's a
           couple of them that I think are
           really good. And I think, maybe I
           could do something with them.
                         
                          JOSH
           I love all your songs.
                         
          They kiss.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          It is 3AM. All the remoteness of that hour is present
          here...we can feel it.
                         
          As still and quiet as deep space.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          The formerly bustling kitchen is now a museum at midnight.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          A long, dark thoroughfare. A ticking clock its only occupant.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Stairs swallowed up by darkness. The groan of settling wood.
                         
                         
          INT. FOSTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The soft breathing of a sleeping child.

          Hanging toy birds dangle over the baby, tinkling in a breeze.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton is sleeping too. Impossibly still. Lying on his back.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai and Josh are entwined together. Josh is snoring. They
          are both blissfully asleep...
                         
          ...for now.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Another day, another chaotic breakfast.
                         
          Foster waves a stuffed toy around. Josh charges in, bits of
          tissue on his face from shaving cuts. Cali flails her arms in
          her high chair. Renai is at the sink, whisking eggs.
                         
                          RENAI
           Foster, sit down honey.
                         
          She whips a look around.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Where is...? Hey Josh, could you go
           wake up Dalton?
                         
          We FOLLOW Josh as he marches down the corridor to Dalton's
          bedroom, poking his head inside.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh knocks on the wall.
                         
                          JOSH
           Time to get up, my man. Come on.
                         
          Nothing from Dalton. He doesn't even stir. Josh rolls his
          eyes and walks in. Nudges Dalton with his knee.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You're making me look bad here.
           Outta bed before your mother comes
           in and kills both of us.
           21.
                         
                         
          Nothing. He's really out.
                         
          Josh reaches down and shakes Dalton vigorously.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton, get up. You've gotta get
           ready for school.
                         
          Josh waits for a response, but none comes. Dalton is as slack
          as a puppet. Something resembling concern crosses Josh's face.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton...?
                         
          He kneels down, shaking Dalton hard. He listens for breathing.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton? Dalton?! DALTON!!
                         
          His scream takes us into--
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, ICU UNIT - DAY
                         
          --the stern sterility of a hospital.
                         
          Josh and Renai, eyes lined by dark circles, stand in front of
          a dour neurologist, DR. JOEL SERCARZ (46).
                         
          Renai dabs her eyes with a tissue. They are red with tears.
          Beyond a window in front of them, lying on a gurney in an ICU
          chamber, is the unconscious body of Dalton.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           Okay...as of yet, our tests have
           not drawn any conclusive answers
           for you. Repeated blood and CSF
           cultures are normal, making an
           infective origin highly unlikely.
           Tests for Lyme disease and repeated
           polymerase chain reaction are
           negative. Systemic vasculitis was
           ruled out. Dalton remains in an
           areactive coma without focal signs
           or abnormal brainstem reflexes.
                         
          Josh and Renai struggle to follow the cold, multi-syllable
          medical terminology...like stranded tourists keeping up with
          a foreign language.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)
           We've looked for bacterial
           pathogens like Meningoencephalitis,
           but haven't seen anything.
                          (MORE)
           22.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)
           I wouldn't say we've exhausted
           every single angle...but we're
           close. The underlying cause is
           still unknown.
                         
          Josh and Renai look in at their boy.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)
           The good news is that he's
           breathing without the use of a
           mechanical apparatus, and there are
           no lesions or hemorrhages in any of
           the CT scans.
                         
                          JOSH
           So...there's no brain damage or...?
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           None that we've detected. Technically,
           he's in a coma. He doesn't respond to
           stimuli, he has no sleep-wake cycle, but
           there's no brain trauma or infection. His
           scans are normal. To be honest, I've
           never seen anything like it.
                         
                          JOSH
           That fall he took...I mean, it looked
           like he hit his head pretty hard.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           We definitely exhausted that
           possibility, but it was always
           doubtful. The cut was superficial,
           there wasn't even a skull fracture.
                         
                          RENAI
           He can't just not wake up...there's
           got to be something...
                         
          Renai sobs, tears streaming down her face. Josh looks like a
          deer in the headlights. Stunned dumb.
                         
          Sercarz clears his throat. This part of the job isn't his
          specialty.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           I'm sorry.
                         
                          JOSH
           So what do we do now? Does he stay here?
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           We'll conduct some further testing, but
           beyond that...I really don't know.
           23.
                         
                         
          His pager goes off. He checks it.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)
           Excuse me for a minute. I have to
           step out. A nurse will be with you
           in just a moment.
                         
          He leaves quickly. Josh and Renai press on the glass,
          separated in body and spirit from their son.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.

          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, LAMBERT HOME - DAY
                         
          A ghastly meld of hospital room and young boys bedroom.
                         
          Dalton lies on his bed, a heart rate monitor hooked to his
          chest. IV tubes run into his arms, a Nasogastric feeding tube
          into his mouth.
                         
          A young nurse, ADELE CHALFIN (30), checks the various tubes
          as Renai watches on.
                         
                          ADELE
           Are you having any more trouble
           with the feeding tube?
                         
          Renai looks broken, the life drained from her. A wilted flower.
          She shakes her head, her voice a low rasp.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (BARELY AUDIBLE)
           It's okay.
                         
                          ADELE
           Alright, well I'll be back soon.
           I'll bring some new books. You're
           probably sick of the ones you have.
                         
                          RENAI
           Did he respond to any of the tests?
                         
          Adele pauses.
                         
                          ADELE
           No...no, he didn't. But we have to
           give it time. I've seen coma
           patients with a much longer
           inactivity time suddenly start
           making noises.
           24.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           He's not in a coma, remember? They
           don't know what to call it. They
           don't know what to do with him so
           they've given up.
                         
                          ADELE
           No, they haven't. We're going to
           figure it out.
                         
          Adele hugs her, then exits. Renai slumps down on a chair next
          to her son.
                         
          The heart rate monitor pings. Dalton is as still as a statue.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
                         
          Renai shuffles down the corridor. She passes a bedroom door,
          then stops and doubles back, pushing it open and going into--
                         
                         
          INT. CALI'S NURSERY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --the babies room.
                         
          She stares into the crib...at her other sleeping baby. She
          sets the baby monitor and walks out softly.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Renai slumps in front of her piano. Taps one of the keys.
                         
          She plays a discordant melody of low notes with one hand, not
          present enough to hear it.
                         
          She stops and buries her face in her hands.
                         
          Then she hears it. Whispering.
                         
          It's so low you would miss it if the house wasn't absolutely
          silent. Renai looks up, scanning for the source of the murmur.
                         
          It is coming from the baby monitor.
                         
          Confused, Renai picks up the monitor, turning up the volume
          all the way up. The hissssssss of static fills the room.
                         
          She presses her ear to the device, then hears it again - a
          hushed WHISPER, almost indistinct from the static save for
          the whistle of sibilants.
           25.
                         
                         
                          VOICE
                          (FROM MONITOR)
           They see us...all of us...we have to be
           quick...this life begs us to come back.
                         
          The whisper trails off....more static...
                         
                          VOICE (CONT'D)
                          (FROM MONITOR)
           NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
                         
          Renai drops the baby monitor, leaping out of her skin at the
          sound of the scream. Nerves fried.
                         
          The monitor smashes on the floor. All is quiet.
                         
          Renai moves to the door, staring down the corridor at the
          door to Cali's nursery.
                         
          It is open only a crack. She hears crying. Cali is crying.
                         
          We follow her as she bolts towards the nursery, smashing
          through the door, eyes filled with terror, seeing--
                         
          --nothing.
                         
                         
          INT. NURSERY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai stalks into the room.
                         
          The room is empty, save for Cali, crying in her crib. Renai's
          eyes land on the closet.
                         
          ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE CLOSET
                         
          Through a slight crack, we see Renai approach. Breath
          quivering. Her hand reaches out. She FLINGS the door open.
                         
          It is empty.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          The family is eating. It's very quiet.
                         
          Foster keeps his eyes down as his parents eat in silence.
          Suddenly Cali breaks the quiet, squealing happily.
                         
                          CALI
           Dadda!
                         
          Josh looks up, smiling. Amazed.
           26.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           She said dad...
                         
          Neither Renai nor Foster even look up.
                         
                         
          INT. FOSTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A bedside lamp gives off a jaundice glow.
                         
          Renai gathers up scattered toys from the floor, relocating
          them to a desktop covered in beakers and lab equipment.
                         
          Foster lies in bed beneath a large chart of the solar system.
                         
          Renai stops cleaning when she finds a certificate, crumpled
          next to a school bag. It says IN RECOGNITION OF SCIENCE
          SKILL, AWARDED TO FOSTER LAMBERT ON 3/14/10.
                         
                          RENAI
           What's this?
                         
                          FOSTER
           An award.
                         
                          RENAI
           That's today's date. You got this
           today?
                         
          Foster nods meekly.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Why didn't you tell us, honey?
                         
          She sits on the edge of his bed. He stares at the wall. She
          strokes his hair.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           I know it's hard right now. But
           things will get better. I promise.
                         
          Foster nods.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           I'm going to show this to your dad.
                         
          She plants a kiss his forehead and stands up.
                         
                          FOSTER
           I'm scared, mom.
                         
                          RENAI
           Scared of what?
           27.
                         
                         
                          FOSTER
           Dalton.
                         
          Renai sits back down.
                         
                          RENAI
           We're all scared. It's normal to be
           scared for him. But we can't give up--
                         
                          FOSTER
           Why do I have to sleep so close to
           him? Can't I change rooms?
                         
                          RENAI
           Why would you wanna change rooms?
                         
          Foster swallows.
                         
                          FOSTER
           I don't know.
                         
          Renai stares at her son. She kisses him again.
                         
                          RENAI
           Your brother needs you. Goodnight
           honey.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Josh lies in bed, reading Foster's award. Renai is beside him.
                         
                          RENAI
           Something happened today. I didn't
           want to tell you in front of Foster.
                         
                          JOSH
           What?
                         
                          RENAI
           I heard something coming from
           Cali's room. A man's voice. On the
           baby monitor...it scared the hell
           outta me. I went in there and no
           one was there.
                         
                          JOSH
           Could it have been interference?
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't know. It was so clear. I
           was sitting at the piano and I
           heard this...whispering on the baby
           monitor. So I held my ear up to it--
           28.
                         
                         
          SUDDENLY - a noise interrupts. An arrhythmic KNOCKING sound,
          like a drunk pounding on a tavern door after closing.
                         
          It is the front door.
                         
                          JOSH
           Who the hell is that?
                         
          Josh knows it's his job to check, but he doesn't want to.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Stay here.
                         
          He gets up.
                         
                         
          INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
                         
          Josh approaches the front door, flashlight in hand. He peers
          through curtains at the front step.
                         
          It's too dark to see anything.
                         
                          JOSH
           Hello? Who's there?
                         
          Only the wind replies.
                         
          He aims the flashlight at the glass, shining it into the
          thick darkness. There is no one on the front step.
                         
          Josh presses the flashlight against the window, arcing the
          beam across his front garden. Leans in close to the glass...
                         
                         AND THEN--
                         
          Nothing. There's no one there.
                         
          He makes sure the door is locked, then flips open a security
          system panel on the wall, pecking at the buttons on it.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai sits up in bed, listening. Hears nothing...
                         
          ...until the low moans of a baby crying float out of the baby
          monitor. Renai hurls the sheet aside.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          Renai pads down the hall, tentative.
           29.
                         
                         
          She reaches the open door to Cali's room. Sees the silhouette
          of Josh standing over Cali's crib. Exhales with relief.
                         
                          RENAI
           Who was it, Josh?
                         
          Josh appears at the opposite end of the hallway.
                         
                          JOSH
           What did you say?
                         
          Renai SCREAMS as the silhouette recedes into the shadows.
                         
                          RENAI
           There's someone in there!
                         
          She RUNS towards Josh.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           There's someone in Cali's room!
                         
          Josh BOLTS down the hall, flicking on the light, terrified.
                         
          The nursery is empty. Cali is sleeping. Terrified, Josh
          enters the room. Scans around. Only toys and colorful
          wallpaper.
                         
          He steps in further. He's not cut out for this.
                         
          SHRIEEEEEEEEEEEKKKK!!!!!! SHRIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!!!!!
                         
          The house alarm screams to deafening life, shaving a few
          years off Josh's life in the process. He JOLTS, whipping
          around.
                         
                          JOSH
                          (TO RENAI)
           Grab Cali and Foster!
                         
          Josh charges down the hall into the--
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --snatching up a fire poker from the fireplace and continuing--
                         
                         
          INT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          -- to the front door, which is swinging open. Holding the
          fire poker aloft, Josh scans the area.
                         
          Renai races past, carrying Cali and dragging Foster behind
          her. They barrel toward Dalton's room.
           30.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh scans the kitchen. It is empty.
                         
          The alarm wails in the background.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh inches his way up the hall, hand shaking.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai holds Foster and Cali close to her. Dalton is lying
          behind them.
                         
          Directly across from Dalton's room is the laundry. The door
          is ajar, offering a view into the darkened room beyond.
                         
          Renai sees something in the dark...a figure. A boy.
                         
          It looks like Dalton. He reaches out to Renai--
                         
          --until another HAND...a pale hand...reaches across and shuts
          the laundry door, sealing the boy off from her view.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh! The laundry!
                         
                         
          INT. LAUNDRY - SAME TIME
                         
          Josh bolts up the hall, panicked. He reaches the laundry
          door, grabbing the handle. Hesitates.
                         
          He propels the door open with a shove, flicking on the light.
                         
          The room is empty. No windows, no doors for escape...just a
          washing machine and a dryer.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          A home security officer trudges down the steps of the house.
                         
          Renai, Josh, Foster and Cali all stand outside in their
          pajamas, shivering in the frigid night air.
                         
                          SECURITY OFFICER
           There's no one in there, it's all
           clear. If someone was there, they're
           gone now.
           31.
                         
                         
          Renai steps away from the children, out of their earshot.
                         
                          RENAI
           I saw somebody.
                         
                          SECURITY OFFICER
           Maybe it was a shadow...?
                         
                          RENAI
           No. It wasn't a shadow, it was a
           man. He was tall, and he long,
           greasy hair. He was wearing a grey
           jacket. He looked right at me.
                         
                          SECURITY OFFICER
           Well, like I said...he's gone now.
                         
          Renai looks to the others. Sees only disbelieving faces.
                         
                         
          INT. GYMNASIUM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Josh's students scuffle about on stadium seating, arranging
          themselves for a CLASS PHOTO. They're not doing a great job.
                         
          A male photographer does his best to compose them, not doing a
          great job of hiding his bitterness about the fact that he's
          shooting school photos instead of Vanity Fair spreads.
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER
           Okay, face the front ladies and
           gentlemen...come on...hold still...
           (muttering to himself)
           I'm trying to record the peak of
           your pathetic lives here.
                         
          Josh stands off to the side, lost in his own thoughts. Tired.
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
           Mr. Lambert, would you like to step
           in please?
                         
          Josh snaps out of his own head.
                         
                          JOSH
           Uh...what?
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER
           Could you step in so that we can
           take the photo? Quickly please.
                         
                          JOSH
           Just take it without me.
           32.
                         
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER
           We need you in the photo, sir.
                         
                          JOSH
           No, you don't. Just take the damn
           photo without me, okay?
                         
          The class settles down, shocked by the outburst. Chastened,
          the photographer turns to the class, gripping the camera
          trigger.
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER
           I can't believe this is my life.
           (beat; to class)
           Ready kids? Say asshole teacher!
                         
                         
          INT. GYMNASIUM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - LATER
                         
          The students file out of the gym. Josh sits in the bleachers,
          head buried in his hands.
                         
           ALANSO (O.S.)
           I hear things.
                         
          Josh looks up, seeing Alanso.
                         
                          JOSH
           What?
                         
                          ALANSO
           I spend so much time in the office,
           I hear things. I heard about your
           son. I'm sorry.
                         
                          JOSH
           Thank you, Alanso.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Times like these...people realize
           that science doesn't have all the
           answers. There is a higher force at
           work.
                         
                          JOSH
           I wish I had your belief. Things
           would be a lot simpler.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Things are simple. You just can't
           see it. Put your faith in Him.
                         
          He places his gold cross necklace in Josh's hand, then leaves.
          Josh watches him go, then takes out his cell phone.
           33.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Hey...I just found out I have to
           stay back tonight and finish off
           mid-term grades. It could be a
           while, there's a lot to go through.
           Don't wait up. Bye.
                         
                         
          EXT. PARK - NIGHT
                         
          Josh sits on a park bench, staring into the distance. He
          takes out a flask of whisky, swigging from it.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. Alone.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Renai shuffles in, pouring herself a glass of water. Then she
          hears it. A low muttering. It is coming from Dalton's room.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          Unnerved, Renai peers through the open door. Josh is sitting
          beside Dalton's bed, reading to him.
                         
                          JOSH
           The men all walked down to the
           waters edge...and they stood there
           and asked the beast to come forth.
           And the beast roared back "No!". And
           so they dived in after it...
                         
                         
          EXT. LAMBERT HOME
                         
          In the sunlight, the house looks like a happy place.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Dalton's face is a picture of serenity.
                         
          A new day-shift nurse, KELLY (29), checks on his feeding
          tube. Renai watches from the doorway.
                         
                          KELLY
           You okay?
           34.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           Yeah.
                         
                          KELLY
           I was going to head off for an hour
           or so. Are you alright here?
                         
                          RENAI
           Of course. Anything from Dalton?
                         
                          KELLY
           No. I'm sorry.
                         
          Renai nods. Her eyes brim with tears. The cracks are showing.
                         
                          KELLY (CONT'D)
           Keep providing him with stimuli. I've
           seen it work time and time again.
           Read to him. Even if you're doing
           something else, you can play him
           music that he likes. Don't give up.
                         
          She throws a scarf over her shoulder and stands.
                         
                          RENAI
           I won't, I just...I haven't slept
           much the last couple of nights. I
           feel like the universe is trying to
           see how far I can bend before I
           break.
                         
                          KELLY
           The universe picked a fight with
           the wrong chick.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thanks, Kelly. You're a saint.
                         
                          KELLY
           No, I'm not. I'm doing my job. I
           chose to be here. You didn't choose
           any of this. You're the strong one.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Renai surveys the living room. It is a total mess.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM - DAY
                         
          Water cascades out of a faucet. Steam rises from the water.
           35.
                         
                         
          Renai lets bath salts fall into the tub. She almost looks
          relaxed just smelling them.
                         
          She starts to undress, then turns --
                         
          -- and YELPS in fright.
                         
          A person is standing behind the distorted glass window,
          staring in at her.
                         
          The shape of the person's head and shoulders can clearly be
          seen, but the glass is too opaque to make out any features.
                         
          Renai slips, grabbing the sink. When she glances up, the
          figure is gone.
                         
          Trembling, Renai opens the window. Very, very slowly.
                         
          It is fifteen feet off the ground, with a sheer drop below it.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Renai sits on the front steps, alone. It is late. She looks
          somehow tired and wired at the same time. Smoking a cigarette.
                         
          Josh pulls in. Fumbles out of his car, tipsy.
                         
                          JOSH
           What are you doing up?
                         
                          RENAI
           It's midnight, Josh.
                         
                          JOSH
           When did you start smoking?
                         
                          RENAI
           You've been coming home late every
           single night. You've never had to
           do that in all of the years you've
           been at the school. Now all of a
           sudden you have to stay back late?
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't like it either, but I'm
           grading tests. What choice do I have?
           We've gotta pay Dalton's bills.
                         
                          RENAI
           Your mother is paying Dalton's
           bills, Josh. I know because she
           reminds me every chance she gets.
           36.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           Jesus, I can't win with you. That's
           my son in there too, not just yours!
                         
          He paces, the anger sobering him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I've always felt like less than
           good enough for you. I feel it
           every time you mention our bills.
           That subtle voice that says `can't
           you get a job that pays more than a
           teacher'? And now I can't even look
           at you without feeling it.
                         
                          RENAI
           You're projecting that onto me.
           You've written an entire story
           about I'm how I'm feeling without
           once asking me how I'm feeling.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't need to ask. I know you.
                         
                          RENAI
           I am losing my mind here in this
           house, Josh. I'm scared and I need
           you and you're not here. Where are
           you?
                         
                          JOSH
           I told you, I'm grading tests.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't mean that. I mean you're
           not here. With me. In this
           situation. You're avoiding it, like
           you do anything stressful, whether
           it's this or a parking ticket.
                         
                          JOSH
           Christ, I should have stayed at the
           school.
                         
                          RENAI
           There you go again.
                         
          Renai stands up and walks inside the house. The door closes.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Josh tosses a pillow onto the couch, setting himself up for
          the night. He curls up on it, pulling a blanket over himself.
           37.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          The witching hour. Still. Quiet...save for the omnipresent
          clock.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton is as still as we've seen him. And then...he twitches.
          A slight facial twitch, but we see it.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Josh snoozes, head arched at a bad angle. His back will
          regret sleeping on this couch.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai tosses and turns, restless in sleep.
                         
          Her eyes open and she sucks in a breath. Bad dreams.
                         
          She blinks and looks around the room, surprised to be alone,
          sitting up in fright. Until she remembers why. She eases back
          onto the bed. Then she looks over at the window.
                         
          There is a man standing outside it.
                         
          He is not looking in at her...he is pacing back and forth,
          furiously smoking a cigarette. Back and forth, back and
          forth. Agitated. He has long, black, greasy hair and a grey
          jacket.
                         
          Every muscle in Renai's body freezes. She becomes a glacier.
                         
          Her eyes are drilled to the man, unable to move. By sheer
          will, she manages to direct them towards the bedroom door.
          Opens her mouth but no words will come. Finally--
                         
                          RENAI
           Jo....osh....Josh....Josh...
                         
          She glances back at the window.
                         
          THE MAN IS NOW IN THE ROOM.
                         
          He paces back and forth between the bed and the window, just
          as he was outside, ignoring Renai. Smoking like a fiend.
                         
          And then, suddenly, he stops pacing. Looks up. Straight at
          Renai - as if just realizing she was there.
           38.
                         
                         
          For a moment their eyes are locked in silence...
                         
          ...and then the man's face contorts in anger and he CHARGES
          towards her, arms outstretched, GROWLING in fury.
                         
                          MAN
           DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE!
                         
          Renai lets out a SHRIEK of terror that could strip paint. A
          cry from the depths of her soul.
                         
          She propels herself backward, falling off the bed and
          scrambling back into the corner.
                         
          Josh CHARGES into the room, flicking on the light--
                         
          --seeing only Renai, huddled in the corner, screaming.
                         
                          JOSH
           What is it? What is it?!
                         
          Renai is incoherent. She cannot stop screaming. Josh grabs
          her by the shoulders.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Renai, what is wrong?!
                         
                          RENAI
           The man -- he was there -- he tried
           to -- there was a man there!!!
                         
          Foster runs into the room, visibly terrified. He sees his
          mother and instantly begins crying. He runs to his dad,
          holding onto his leg.
                         
          In the background, Cali begins crying, her screams
          contributing to an overwhelming din.
                         
                          JOSH
           There's no one here.
                         
                          RENAI
           I saw somebody!
                         
                          JOSH
           There's no one here.
                         
                          RENAI
           Don't you dare not believe me!
                         
                          JOSH
           I believe you, okay? I just don't
           know what you want me to do.
           39.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           I want you to tell me that we can
           leave this house. I will not spend
           one more night here. I wanna leave,
           I wanna go!
                         
                          FOSTER
           I don't want the man to get me.
                         
          The realization that her child is terrified quiets Renai.
                         
          All is suddenly silent, save for the cries of Cali in the
          background. Josh holds his son tight.
                         
                          JOSH
           You're okay, buddy. I've got you.
                         
          He and Renai exchange a look.
                         
                          RENAI
           I'm sorry.
                          (BEAT)
           I can't...I want to leave this
           house. I can't be here anymore.
                         
                          JOSH
           To move now would be...we would
           have to rent somewhere. It's not--
                         
                          RENAI
           Please, Josh.
                         
                         
          An agreement passes between them.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         
          EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A moving truck is parked outside an average suburban home.
                         
          Movers mill about, hauling boxes and couches.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Renai unpacks boxes. An elderly woman, LORRAINE (65), helps to
          unpack. This is Josh's mother. She has a curt, disapproving
          manner about her that doesn't always make her easy to love.
                         
          She is actually moving more quickly than Renai, who groans as
          if her back were aching as she stoops down to pick up books.
           40.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           Lorraine, you shouldn't have to do
           any of this. Sit down.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           Nonsense. I'm perfectly capable of
           putting a few things away. I did it
           for Josh his whole life. He never
           was good with tidying up.
                         
                          RENAI
           I know, but I just feel so bad.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           I think it's you who should be
           sitting down by the looks of it.
                         
          She boosts a photo frame from one of the boxes. It is a
          portrait of Renai, Dalton, Foster and Josh. In happier times.
                         
          Lorraine seems taken aback by it.
                         
                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)
           I can't believe you got Josh to sit
           still for a photo.
                         
          Renai reclines against the wall, surveying her new living
          room. Her new new house.
                         
                          RENAI
           I can't believe we're doing all this
           again, that's what I can't believe.
           (beat; looks at her)
           I know you think I'm crazy.
                         
          Lorraine stops unpacking and fixes Renai with a stare. They've
          never really gotten along before. Adversity has brought about
          a truce.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           Nobody - not me, not anybody -
           knows what you're going through
           right now. Whatever you have to do
           to get through it, do it. And never
           apologize for it.
                         
          Renai hugs her. It's a new thing for them and a bit awkward.
                         
                         
          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          DR. BRYCE TRIMBLE (52) sits opposite Renai and Josh. Spread
          out in front of him are a series of X-Rays, labelled DALTON
          LAMBERT. His office is big and expensive.
           41.
                         
                         
          Renai looks hopeful. Josh looks like a shell of a man.
                         
                          RENAI
           We just wanna say...thank you so
           much. For helping us out with this,
           doctor. We can't tell you how much
           it means to have you involved.
                         
           DR. TRIMBLE
           I'm glad to help.
                          (BEAT)
           Unfortunately...these recent tests
           have proven inconclusive. There's
           absolutely nothing abnormal here.
                         
          Josh and Renai deflate.

           So...if you're the top of the food
           chain with this stuff, where does
           that leave us?
                         
           DR. TRIMBLE
           I don't know. There is a research
           team in Boston who specialize in a
           new form of treatment. They try to
           stimulate the patients brain with
           electric pulses. It has a good
           success rate with victims of brain
           injury. We could try that.
                         
                          RENAI
           So there's hope?
                         
           DR. TRIMBLE
           There are more things we can try.
                          (BEAT)
           The hope part is up to you.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Renai sits beside Dalton. Staring at him. She runs her
          fingers through his hair, touching his skin.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A needle touches an LP.
                         
          The pops and crackles of record hiss spit forth, followed by
          the lilting guitar strums of `Tip Toe Through The Tulips'.
                         
          The quavering falsetto of Tiny Tim accompanies the guitar.
           42.

           Tip-toe by the window, by the
           window, that is where I'll be...
                         
          Renai walks away and we follow her down the hall into --
                         
                         
          INT. FOSTER'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          -- a mess as only a child can make.
                         
          Renai picks up a plate and a fork and knife from the floor.
          She walks out and we DON'T CUT, tracking with her --

          -- back down the hall, towards the kitchen. The records
          continues warbling in the background.

           Oh tip-toe, from the garden, by the
           garden, of the willow tree...
                         
          Renai passes the living room.
                         
          What she doesn't see is the child standing in the middle of
          the room, facing the record player.
                         
          The boy is dressed in clothes from another time, but
          children's clothes just the same.
                         
          He is dancing awkwardly, shifting his weight from one foot to
          foot the other sheepishly, as if trying it for the first
          time.
                         
          Renai keeps walking and we stay with her as she moves past
          the child, following her into the --
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          -- mess of the kitchen.
                         
          She sets the plate down in the sink, on top of a stack of
          other dirty dishes.
                         
          With a sigh she runs the hot water over the dishes.
                         
          With a sudden POP, the record starts skipping.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
           43.
                         
                         
          Renai shuts off the water, heading back to the living room.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          She marches in, annoyed.
                         
          Then freezes.
                         
          Her bookshelf is empty. The books that once sat on it are now
          scattered across the floor.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          Renai scans the books.
                         THEN
                         SHE
                         HEARS
          it...
                         
          Giggling.
                         
          She pivots her head towards the darkened hallway. There, she
          sees a child, hidden in shadow, standing in the hall. Staring
          at her.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          Renai doesn't move. Doesn't breathe.
                         
          And then suddenly, the child turns and runs down the hall,
          disappearing into Dalton's bedroom.
                         
                          RENAI
           Oh my God, Dalton...no...
                         
          Summoning every ounce of strength, Renai troops down the hall
          towards Dalton's room.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Renai pushes the door open.
                         
          Dalton lies in the center of the room on his gurney. The only
          sound is his breathing.
                         
          Renai surveys the room. It is empty.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          She steps inside, glancing over at a cabinet. In the foot-
          high space beneath it, a small white shoe protrudes slightly.
           44.
                         
                         
          A child's shoe.
                         
          Heart pounding, Renai bends down, peering into the darkness
          under the cabinet.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          The shoe does not have a foot in it. It is simply a discarded
          shoe. There is no one under the cabinet.
                         
          BANG!!!
                         BA G
                         
          The cabinet doors EXPLODE open as the child bursts out,
          giggling. Only we see that it is not a child.
                         
          It is a DWARF. A man in child's clothing. The dwarf runs past
          Renai as she LEAPS back. He runs out of the room, giggling.
          All is quiet again.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          Renai gets up, unsure of what to do. Numb with terror.
                         
          SUDDENLY-- the record pitches back to life, the volume
          startling. Renai JOLTS, falling backwards.
                         
                         
          INT. CLASSROOM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT
                         
          A darkened class room.
                         
          An older janitor, NED (68), shoulders the door open, carrying a
          mop. He STARTS when he sees Josh, sitting at his desk in the
          pale light of a desk lamp. Alone.
                         
                          NED
           Josh...didn't see you there.
                         
                          JOSH
           Sorry to scare you.
                         
                          NED
           What are you up to this late?
                         
          Josh holds up his flask of whisky. He's a bit soused.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where did all the bartenders who
           listen to your troubles go, Ned?
                         
          Ned nods sagely. He sets down his mop and grabs a chair,
          sitting in front of Josh with a sigh. He takes the flask.
           45.
                         
                         
                          NED
           Never drink alone. If you take the
           dirty jokes out of drunkenness, all
           you're left with is the self loathing.
                         
          He downs a hit from the flask, then hands it back.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't need whisky for that.
                         
                          NED
           Bah. You people think too much.
           Used to be, if life threw a
           shitstorm at you, you'd grab the
           nearest umbrella. Your generation
           would spend a day googling what
           brand to buy.
                         
          Josh laughs despite himself.
                         
                          JOSH
           I probably would too.
           (beat; takes a drink)
           It's funny, I've always known I was
           the type of person that things
           didn't happen to. I made peace with
           it. I thought to myself, it's okay -
           I'll never win the lottery or climb
           Mount Everest...but I'll never get
           a rare tropical blood disease
           either. It works out.

           Things happen to everybody. Even to
           good people like you. And they're

           Be with your wife. Tell her your
           what's on your mind.
                         
          He takes the flask and has another swig.
                         
                          NED (CONT'D)

          EXT. NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Josh pulls up to the house. Turns off the car.
           46.
                         
                         
          An old Cadillac is sitting in the driveway. Josh clambers out
          of his car and peers in through the window of the Cadillac,
          quizzical.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Renai is huddled on the couch in the living room, gripping her
          knees to her chest. A man is sitting next to her; a handsome,
          soft-spoken Anglican priest, FATHER NATHANSON (40).
                         
          Josh enters. There are subtle changes in his coordination and
          speech from the booze.
                         
                          JOSH
           This is the first line of a joke.
           Guy comes home to find his wife
           with a priest...
                         
          Father Nathanson stands, as does Renai.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh, this is Liam Nathanson. A
           very old friend of mine.
                         
                          FATHER NATHANSON
           Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot
           about you.
                         
                          JOSH
           Can't say I've heard the same,
           Liam. At least I know you're not
           sleeping with her.
                         
           LORRAINE (O.S.)
           Don't be rude, Josh.
                         
          Josh turns to see his mother, holding a tray of tea. He frowns.
                         
                          JOSH
           What is going on here?
                         
                          FATHER NATHANSON
           I should be going. Thank you so much
           for the tea.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thanks, Liam.
                         
          He clears his throat and exits, quickly and quietly.
                         
                          JOSH
           Okay, would anyone mind telling me
           what the hell is going on here?
           47.
                         
                         
                          LORRAINE
          Please sit down, Joshua.

          "Joshua?" Oh Jesus...
                         
                          LORRAINE
          Sit down.
                         
                          JOSH
          The melodramatic way in which you
          two are conducting yourselves right
          now is scaring the shit out of me,
          so just tell me what's wrong.
                         
                          LORRAINE
          Nothing is wrong. We want to talk.
                         
                          JOSH
          Nobody asks you to sit down unless
          something is wrong. If a doctor
          calls you into his office and asks
          you to sit down, you're fucked.
                         
                          RENAI
          There's no use, Lorraine. He's been
          drinking.
                         
                          JOSH
          I have not been drinking. Not
          enough that we can't talk to each
          other, Renai. And don't judge me in
          that bitchy tone, okay?
                         
                          RENAI
                          (TO LORRAINE)
          He would never speak to me like
          that before.
                         
                          JOSH
          Christ. You're acting like I'm some
          lush who comes home and beats you
          with a belt. At least I'm speaking
          to you. You suddenly have to speak
          to a priest. Or my mother who, up
          until a couple of weeks ago, you
          couldn't stand.
                         
                          RENAI
          You're an asshole.
                         
                          LORRAINE
          Your wife needs you. Now sit down and
          listen to her. I won't ask you again.
           48.
                         
                         
          Josh obeys. His mothers tone can still shut him up.
                         
                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)
           Go on, Renai. Tell him.
                         
                          RENAI
           This...thing that was in the other
           house. It followed us.
                         
          Josh shifts in his seat. Agitated.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           Let her speak.
                         
                          RENAI
           I saw someone again today. In the
           house. It looked like a young boy.
           I followed it into Dalton's room...
           but it wasn't a child.
                          (BEAT)
           This thing is here. I know it.
                         
                          JOSH
           So...what? You called in a priest
           to get rid of it?
                         
                          RENAI
           I didn't know what else to do.
                         
                          JOSH
           Are you kidding me?
                          (TO LORRAINE)
           Was this your idea?
                         
                          RENAI
           No. It was mine.
                         
                          JOSH
           You've never been to a church in
           your life. Now you're inviting a
           priest into our home? I feel like I
           don't even know you right now.
                         
                          RENAI
           I'm scared.
                         
                          JOSH
           This is a fantasy, and you need a

                          LORRAINE
           What's happening to Renai is real.
           I've seen it for myself.
                          (BEAT)
           I came here today because last night
           I had a dream about this place.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          We are FLOATING through the corridor, looking through
          Lorraine's POV.
                         
          We are inside her dream.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.)
           I was in this house...but it was
           late at night.
                         
          The POV keeps moving, out of the kitchen and into the hall.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I tried to be quiet. I didn't want
           to wake anybody. I was afraid.
                         
          The POV floats down the hall, reaching a door. The door
          opens, revealing Josh and Renai, sleeping.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I looked into your bedroom. You
           were both asleep.
                         
          The POV keeps moving down the hall.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I knew that I was asleep in the
           dream...but I could feel that
           someone was awake in the house.
                         
          We keep pushing on, reaching the door to Dalton's room.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I went into Dalton's room.
                         
          The door pushes open. In the dark, we can see Dalton, in bed.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           There was someone in there with him.
                         
          The POV turns to see a DARK FIGURE, standing in the corner.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           A man was standing in the corner of
           the room.

           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I asked him who he was...he said he
           was a visitor. I asked him what he
           wanted...he said Dalton.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Lorraine is clearly unsettled by the dream.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           I can still hear that voice.
                         
          She looks up at Josh - and SCREAMS!
                         
          Over Josh's shoulder, crouched down behind the couch and
          peeking up over the armrest at Lorraine, is a DIABOLICAL
          FIGURE. His face is PURE RED with smeared lipstick. His scalp
          is completely bald, yet tufts of hair dangle above his ears.
          Other than his face, his skin is charcoal black.
                         
          Lorraine recoils back, utterly petrified.
                         
                          JOSH
           What is it?
                         
          Lorraine stares eerily into his eyes. Frozen.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           He's here.
                         
          Renai looks to Josh, who is at a total loss. She is crying.
                         
                          RENAI
           Help us...
                         
          His anger fades and he steps over and takes her in his arms.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't know how.

          A battered van is parked in the driveway of the house.

          Renai and Josh stand in front of two men. They are silent.

          The shorter one is a wiry young man who looks like he spends
          most of his time in dark rooms. Not a member of the beach
          volleyball team. This is SPECS (32).
                         
          The other is TUCKER (33), a larger man with scruffy facial
          hair. He is eating a Hot Pocket.
                         
                          SPECS

           That wasn't psychic. Lorraine told

           I'm here to solve your problem. I'm

                          JOSH
           This is a little uncomfortable.
           Speaking for myself. I'm not used

           technical. It's an even split. He
           couldn't change a light bulb and I'm
           no good with paperwork. It bores me
           senseless.

          Tucker edges into the corridor. He switches out the light,
          then takes what looks like a modified VIEW-MASTER TOY out of
          his shoulder bag, holding it up to his eyes.
                         
          He stalks down the corridor with it. All is quiet.

          He approaches the grandfather clock. Another slide clicks
          into place - showing us TWO FIGURES. Standing beside the
          clock.
                         
          In the negative light, they look like females.

          Josh opens the door to see an elderly woman, ELISE RAINIER
          (73), who despite her years maintains a sprightly energy.
                         
          There is absolutely nothing morbid or dour about her.

          Elise takes her hat off and scans the room, taking a deep

           No, that's fine, gentlemen.
                         
          She stares up at the ceiling, as if seeing something they can't.

          Renai and Josh stay back, sheepish. Elise stalks forward at
          the front, surveying every nook and cranny of the house.
                         
          Elise stops suddenly. She is staring straight at a corner of
          the hallway, next to the grandfather clock.
                         
                          RENAI

           This is where I saw it.
                         
          Elise calmly mutters something to Specs in a low voice, but
          we have trouble hearing it - only snatches of key words.

          but detailed. Impressive.
                         
          He outlines the wall, the ceiling lamp, the grandfather
          clock.
                         
          And then something else...
                         
          Two young women. Standing next to the grandfather clock,
          dressed in Amish garb. Even in the roughness of the drawing,
          we can make out their pleading eyes and pale skin.
                         
          Tucker takes out a camera, snaps some shots. Josh and Renai
          step forward, seeing the sketch.
                         
          Elise keeps moving, heading straight for one door in
          particular. She stops, running her hand over the wood.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)

          The door groans open.
                         
          Dalton is lying on his gurney, surrounded by the sluggish
          drone of hospital equipment. The curtains are drawn and the
          room is dark.
                         
          Elise hesitates...then steps inside.
                         
                          ELISE
           Leave the lights off.
                         
          Elise steps closer to Dalton. She runs her hands over his
          prone body. She shivers as she does.
                         
          A ripple of fear passes through her. Her breath quickens.
                         
          Slowly...very very slowly ...she gazes up at a corner of
          the ceiling. Her eyes WIDEN and the look on her face

          Elise cups her hand over her mouth and whispers to Specs,
          keeping her eyes GLUED to the far corner of the ceiling. We
          cannot hear what she is whispering.
                         
          Hand shaking, Specs feverishly starts to sketch. We cannot
          see what he is drawing.

          The strokes of Specs' pencil become faster and rougher,
          keeping up with Elise's whispers. Sweat dots his forehead.
                         
          Tucker glances at the drawing and steps back instinctively.
          He holds up his Viewmaster.
                         
          POV THROUGH VIEWMASTER - we see the far corner of the ceiling
          change color as Tucker rotates the lenses inside...but
          nothing out of the ordinary appears. Just a ceiling.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Tell me!
           60.
                         
                         
          Suddenly, Renai charges forward, snatching the sketch book.
                         
          The drawing is of a hideous form - crouched in the corner of
          the ceiling, staring down at Dalton below. It is the RED-
          FACED DEMON Lorraine saw earlier.
                         
          His naked body is charcoal black...whilst also strangely
          translucent, the veins visible underneath the flesh. A
          corpulent stomach juts out, as if he were pregnant.
                         
          Terrified, Renai flicks on the light --
                         
          -- revealing nothing but an ordinary ceiling.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Elise holds court in the living room.
                         
          Renai and Josh hold each other, struggling to comprehend it all.
                         
                          ELISE
           I'm not sure if you are ready to
           hear this yet...but unfortunately I
           can't waste any time easing you
           into it. There is no time left.
                         
          She takes a deep breath, preparing herself.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           I want you to know that this is
           what I believe and it may
           contradict a previous medical
           diagnosis. However, you called me
           here and I am taking that as an
           acceptance of my readings.
                         
                          RENAI
           Go on.
                         
                          ELISE
           Your son...is not in a coma. His
           physical body is here, but his
           spiritual body is not.
                          (BEAT)
           The reason these disturbances
           followed you to a new home is
           because...it is not the house that
           is haunted. It is your son.
                         
          This is too much for Josh. Renai, however, wants to listen.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't understand...
           61.
                         
                         
          Elise considers what she is about to say carefully.
                         
                          ELISE
           Have you ever heard of astral
           projection?
                         
                          RENAI
           Out of body experiences?
                         
          Elise nods.
                         
                          ELISE
           I call them travellers. These are
           people with the ability to leave
           their physical body and travel to
           different places in an astral form.
           To some degree, we all have the
           ability to do it...but most of us
           subconsciously suppress it or don't
           know how to access it.
                         
          Josh shakes his head, agitated. Renai leans forward,
          desperate for an answer to her terror.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Dalton is...a very accomplished
           astral projector. He has been since
           he was very young. He's not afraid
           of his ability. And that lack of
           fear has led him to travel too far
           and become lost...
                         
                          RENAI
           Lost? Lost where?
                         
          Elise gazes up at the ceiling, as if looking into another world.
                         
                          ELISE
           In The Further.
                         
                          RENAI
           What do you mean?
                         
                          ELISE
           The Further is that place beyond our
           perception, beyond our understanding
           of the physical world that we can see
           and touch. It is a place without
           clocks or measurements, without past
           or future...an infinite realm that
           holds all of our dreams...and all of
           our nightmares.
                         
          She turns to look at them.
           62.
                         
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           That is where Dalton is.
                         
          Renai cries, unprepared for what she is hearing.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           The problem is that with his astral
           body gone, he has left a physical
           body with us. An empty vessel.
                         
          Josh can't meet her gaze.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           And there are entities that know
           this. They can smell it - the
           chance to live again. That is why
           they have gathered around him.
                         
                          RENAI
           How many are there?
                         
                          ELISE
           There are five benevolent spirits.
           Five different entities for whom
           Dalton has become a most prized
           possession. They are trying to get
           inside his physical body...and they
           get closer with each passing day.
                         
          Her words hang in the air like gunsmoke. Pure fear courses
          through Josh's eyes. He fidgets, agitated.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Then there are two entities who
           are...not benevolent. One of them
           takes the form of a man, the
           other...
                         
          She holds up the drawing that Specs di.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           They work together, so desperate
           are they to possess Dalton. They
           are the closest of all the entities
           to getting inside him.
                          (BEAT)
           I don't want to scare you, but I
           have never, in all my years of
           doing this, experienced anything as
           terrifying as their presence.
                         
                          RENAI
           Is there a way to bring Dalton back?
           63.
                         
                         
                          ELISE
           There is something we could try. A
           way of calling him back. I would
           need your complete trust.
                         
          Josh can't take it any more. He stands up.
                         
                          JOSH
           No. No. This has gone too far.
                         
                          RENAI
           You said that you'd give her a chance!
                         
                          JOSH
           I have given her a chance, and I
           did that because I wanted to help
           you. But I cannot have somebody
           telling us that the reason our son
           is in a coma is because his soul is
           floating off somewhere in another
           dimension.
                         
                          ELISE
           I know this is hard to hear.
                         
                          JOSH
           No, it's not fair is what it is.
           You're preying on people's grief and
           vulnerability, which is really easy
           to do in a situation like this.
                         
                          RENAI
           Why did we go to all the trouble of
           bringing them here if you're just
           going to reject what they say?
                         
                          JOSH
           Because I wanted to help you. To
           put your mind at ease, and if this
           helped, then great. But to drag
           Dalton into this? No.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh, you're not being fair...
                         
                          JOSH
           Fair? How did the voice of reason
           become the bad guy here? Don't you
           see? You want to believe. Of course
           you do, honey, anybody would.
                         
          The room goes quiet. Josh turns to Elise.
           64.
                         
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Look, I appreciate what you're
           trying to do. I really do. But I
           think it's dangerous to start
           throwing out false hope like this.
           I have to put my foot down. My wife
           is not...mentally well at the
           moment, and I have to keep at least
           one of her feet here in the real
           world.
                         
                          RENAI
           You never believed me...
                         
                          JOSH
           Honey, I'm on your side. But I
           genuinely think this is dangerous
           and frankly, a little exploitative.
                         
          He turns to Elise, Specs and Tucker.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You come into a home with a
           seriously ill child, you make a
           tenuous connection between him and
           these experiences Renai is having
           and viola - the client starts
           crying because they're desperate to
           believe, the tears validate your
           power, thank you, that'll be six
           hundred dollars please.
                         
                          SPECS
           We reject more cases than we take.
           We're not out for money, sir.
                         
                          JOSH
           I know, I know...look, I appreciate
           your interest and your time. I do.
           Thank you. Thank you very much.
                         
          He goes to the front door, opening it.
                         
                          ELISE
           I completely understand. And I
           honestly don't blame you for
           reacting like this.
                         
          She walks to the door, followed by Specs and Tucker, who
          sling their bags over their shoulders sheepishly.
                         
                          RENAI
           No, please...don't go.
           65.
                         
                         
                          ELISE
           Thank you for your time.
                         
          They exit. The door closes. They are gone.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Renai lies in bed, awake...a broken shell of her former self.
          A bottle of anti-depressants sits on the bedside table.
                         
          Josh enters the bedroom. Sits down beside her.
                         
                          JOSH
           Look at me for a second, honey.
                          (BEAT)
           Look at me.
                         
          She doesn't look up.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Did you really believe what she
           said? In your heart of hearts, did
           you actually take what she was
           saying literally?
                         
          A long beat of silence passes.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't know...
                         
                          JOSH
           Do you think I don't want to
           believe in that stuff? Of course I
           do. It would make life a lot easier
           if I did. If I believed that some
           supernatural force was responsible
           for what's happened to our son...
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't believe anything anymore,
           Josh. I used to. I used to believe
           that I could keep my children safe.
           I used to believe everything would
           be okay. To believe in something,
           you have to know it to be true.
                         
          She turns and looks at him.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           The things that have happened to me
           haven't confirmed any beliefs -
           they've done the opposite. They've
           made me question what I believe.
                          (MORE)
           66.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           They've made me realize that maybe
           we don't know as much as we think
           we do.
                         
          Josh paces, at his wits end.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           You ask me if I believe what she
           said to be true and the answer is I
           don't know. But let me ask you this
           - in your heart of hearts, can you
           say for certain that it isn't?
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Josh lies beside Renai, who is sleeping. He is wide awake,
          staring at the ceiling.
                         
          He gets out of bed.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The door opens.
                         
          All is mute as Josh enters, skulking carefully through the
          darkness.
                         
          The curtains lull in the slightest of breezes.
                         
          Josh stands over Dalton.
                         
          He stares down at his sons body, then lets his gaze drift
          around the room...past the CLOSET, past the DRAWINGS pinned
          to the wall and the TOYBOX...all the way to the CORNER of the
          ceiling that Elise was so frightened of. Josh's eyes drill
          into the shadows.
                         
          Is there something waiting there?
                         
          Finally, Josh sits down beside Dalton. He grips his sons hand.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where are you? Where did you go?
                          (BEAT)
           Can you hear me? I'm begging you to
           show me that you can hear me...I
           don't know how to help you. Please
           tell me what to do.
                         
          Josh's torment fills the air...but Dalton doesn't move.
           67.
                         
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Please God, please help me...give
           me my son back. I will do anything
           just to have him back.
                         
          Josh studies Dalton's face for a response. Nothing. Not a
          twitch. He collapses forward onto Dalton. Holding him tight.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I need him back. I need him to show
           me that he can hear me. Please...
                         
          For a moment, all we can hear is Josh's breathing.
                         
          Then...something happens. Something Josh doesn't see.
                         
          Dalton's face twitches. It is a very slight movement. This
          movement is followed by something that is hard to miss--
                         
          One of the tacks pinning one of Dalton's drawings to the wall
          begins to wind loose.
                         
          It pops free, shooting across the room like a kernel of
          popcorn...followed by another tack.
                         
          The second tack lands in Josh's lap. Puzzled, he picks it up,
          examining it. He looks up, his eye drawn to the picture on
          the wall.
                         
          With total astonishment, he sees the two remaining tacks
          works themselves free, popping out of the wall.
                         
          The drawing floats down to the ground.
                         
          Josh stoops down, picking it up.
                         
          It is a drawing split into two halves. The left half is a
          self portrait of Dalton, lying in bed, looking down from
          above.
                         
          The right half is a depiction of outer space - squiggly stars
          and bloated planets.
                         
          Dalton has drawn another version of himself on this side,
          flying above the house with another man.
                         
          At the bottom of the first drawing, Dalton has written `Last
          night I watched myself sleep'.
                         
          A tear falls down Josh's face. He begins to cry. Deep and
          painful tears he has long pent up.
                         
          Beneath the second drawing, Dalton has written `Then I flew away.'
           68.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
                         
          Renai's eyes flutter open. She glances over. No one is there.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
                         
          Renai shuffles into the kitchen.
                         
          Josh is sitting at the kitchen table, staring at Dalton's
          drawing. He hasn't slept and looks it. He looks up at her.
                         
                          JOSH
           Okay.
                         
          Renai approaches Josh and they hug...holding on for dear life.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The Lambert house is lit from within. Like a Jack-O-Lantern.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Action stations.
                         
          Tucker sets up two stills camera's around Dalton's room,
          zipping back and forth between the two tripods. Specs opens
          up a kit, taking out his notepad and a pencil.
                         
          A small, circular table has been set up, adjacent to Dalton's
          bed. Elise sits at the table, flanked on either side by Josh
          and Renai.
                         
                          ELISE
           What's most important is that you
           realize no two attempts are the
           same. I will be completely honest
           with you about the results, and if
           no dialogue is established, I will
           tell you. I am not in the business
           of embellishing success. What
           happens, happens.
                         
          Josh and Renai nod grimly, truly out of their depth.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Forget the limits and laws and logic
           of this world. We are treading in a
           different place now.
                         
          Tucker finally sets his cameras and takes a seat in the corner,
          holding up a HAND-HELD VIDEO CAMERA.
           69.
                         
                         
                          TUCKER
           These still cameras are rigged to
           pick up changes in the atmosphere,
           electrical or temperature-wise. Don't
           be alarmed if they go off.
                         
                          ELISE
           Everything I say while I am in tune
           will be at a very low volume, so
           you won't hear any of it. Steven
           will write it down and repeat it
           for you.
                         
          Specs waits obediently at her side.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Hold on to each other, and stay
           focused. You'll see things you
           don't understand. Confusing things.
           Do not question them or speak in
           any way.
                         
          She turns to Specs.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Dim the lights please.
                         
          Tucker reaches up and dims the lights to a very low level.
                         
          Elise closes her eyes, concentrating. She relaxes her head,
          as if meditating, letting it loll on her shoulders.
                         
          One of the cameras on the tripod goes off, bathing the room
          in white light for a split second.
                         
          Elise inhales and exhales deeply, slipping away. Soon, she is
          very still.
                         
          Specs nods to Tucker silently, then produces an odd looking
          device made from GREY CLOTH.
                         
          It almost resembles a gas mask from World War 1, with a cone
          shaped muzzle that fits over the mouth and nose. The snout of
          the facemask is like an elongated elephant trunk, coiling
          outwards and ending in an old listening device, like an early
          version of a microphone.
                         
          Specs slips two hooks over Elise's ears and gently places the
          device over her nose and mouth. He then takes a seat next to
          her, behind Renai, who holds Elise's hand.
                         
          Specs takes out his notepad and fixes a small apparatus
          around his neck that holds a flashlight in place.
           70.
                         
                         
          He flicks it on, then holds the microphone end of Elise's
          facemask up to his ear, a pencil gripped in the other hand.
                         
          Dead silence descends over the group like a blanket.
                         
          Then, we hear something lilt through the old microphone. It
          is Elise's muttered whispers. Specs begins writing.
                         
          Renai opens her eyes to peek at what he is scribbling in
          cursive.
                         
          we are calling out to you dalton
          Renai grips Josh's hand tightly.
                         
                          SPECS
           We are calling out to you Dalton.

                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           Tell us that you are safe. Tell us
           where you are.
                         
          For what seems like an eternity, all is quiet and still...
                         
          ...until Elise's eyelids flutter.
                         
          Another unintelligible whisper drifts out of the microphone
          at Specs' ear. He writes.
           who's there?
                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           Who's there?
           it is your mother and father we have been

                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           It is your mother and father. We
           have been looking for you.
                         
          Long pause. Specs writes again, more intense this time.
                         
          i need help i can't see in here
                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           I need help...I can't see in here.

           to us.
                         
          Another long pause. A little too long.
                         
          Why aren't you talking anymore dalton?
                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           Why aren't you talking anymore
           Dalton?
                         
          A long beat. Tucker's camera flash goes off again.
                         
          if they hear me they'll hurt me
                          SPECS (CONT'D)

                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           Who will hurt you?

                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           The man with fire on his face.
                         
           can you find your way back to us?
                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           Can you find your way back to us?

           72.
                         
                         
                          SPECS (CONT'D)

          come and get mepleasecomeandgetmecome
          Elise's head TWITCHES as Specs' writes furiously, trying to
          keep up. His pencil finally SNAPS. He snatches up another.
                         
           dalton are you there? dalton?
          An agonizing ocean of silence...then this furious scrawl:
                         
          listen to me you filthy whore he isnt here
          you should not have come here you fucking
          bitch i will rip your cunt apart and eat the
          fucking innards that spill forth from it i
                         HAVESEENYOUIKNOWWHOYOUAREBUTYOUANDTHE
          Specs writing begins to SHRED the paper as he writes
          furiously, the scrawl getting out of control. Sweat flies
          from his forehead as he struggles to get it all down.
                         
          Suddenly a PIERCING SCREAM blasts through the microphone and
          he jerks it away from his ear - then looks over at Elise.
                         
          With UTTER DREAD, he sees that she is NO LONGER WEARING THE
          MASK. She has taken it off and is panting heavily.
                         
          The scream continues through the mic, audible to
          everyone...then peters out.
                         
          Shocked silence follows.
                         
          Josh glances over at Dalton's bed.
                         
          He is not in it.
           73.
                         
                         
          Stunned, Josh turns back to the table--
                         
          --TO SEE DALTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM. STARING AT HIM.
                         
          His heart leaps out of his skin and so does Renai's as they
          both turn towards Dalton. Their son.
                         
          Dalton stares at them...not a trace of emotion on his face.
                         
          Then he reaches up and grips his bottom jaw with both hands,
          wrenching it downwards with almighty force and BREAKING HIS
          OWN JAW.
                         
          Renai SCREAMS into the abyss as Dalton BELLOWS at them, spit
          flying from his throat, his tongue hanging down over his
          dislocated jaw.
                         
          He stamps his foot and the table - and everyone sitting at
          it, Renai, Josh and Elise - go flying backwards as if pushed
          by a hurricane, smashing into the wall with crushing power.
                         
          We realize that Dalton was not sitting at the table, but
          squatting down awkwardly. Painfully.
                         
          He stands up, then steps forward. As Josh and Renai watch,
          his KNEE begins to BEND BACKWARDS, the tendons stretching and
          snapping, the knee bending in the opposite direction.
                         
          His other knee follows and he steps forward - both knees
          bending back.
                         
          Specs is rigid in his chair, rooted to the spot, notepad
          still in hand. When he looks up at Dalton, the flashlight
          under his chin shines in Dalton's eyes.
                         
          Dalton ROARS and advances forward - SLAPPING Specs with the
          force of ten men. Specs reels backwards, hitting the wall,
          smashing his head and crumpling like paper.
                         
          Elise stands to face Dalton. The CAMERA FLASH goes off again,
          lighting the darkened room for a split second and showing
          Elise the lipstick-smeared face of a demon instead of
          Dalton's face.
                         
          Tucker SHRINKS BACK as he captures all this with the video camera.
                         
          Dalton steps forward again and Elise CHARGES at him, grabbing
          Dalton by the hair.
                         
                          ELISE
           Leave this vessel! Leave this vessel!
                         
          Dalton BELLOWS again - a howl so course and ungodly that it
          seems ripped straight from the bowels of Lucifer himself.
           74.
                         
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           LEAVE THIS VESSEL!
                         
          Dalton FLIES backwards, hitting the corner of the wall and
          then CLIMBING IT, arcing his body into the far corner of the
          ceiling like an expert contortionist.
                         
          He hisses at them as the CAMERA FLASH fires AGAIN AND AGAIN,
          showing them split second frames of the red faced CREATURE.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Leave this earthly body!
                         
          Dalton shrieks again and somehow the force of the cry knocks
          Elise down.
                         
          The room begins to shake.
                         
          Books fly.
                         
          The closet doors burst open.
                         
          With terror, Elise looks over and sees several figures
          peering out from within the closet.
                         
          Two are the women that Specs' drew. Another is a small man,
          dressed like a child.
                         
          They stare out at Elise, their eyes glinting in the dark.
                         
          Elise turns to see Josh. The camera flash STROBES repeatedly
          and gives us split-second glimpses of an OLD WOMAN, dressed
          in Victorian era garb - standing directly behind Josh.
                         
          And then, with absolute fear, Renai sees the LONG HAIRED MAN
          standing over her. He SCREAMS at her and pushes her against
          the wall, licking her. She cries out, terrified.
                         
          With the spirit world, crashing in around her, Elise pulls
          herself off the floor and yells again.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Leave his body!
                         
          Dalton suddenly SPASMS, dropping out of the corner and
          hitting the floor like a rag doll dropped off a bridge.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           The lights!
                         
          Terrified, Specs' scrambles over to the corner, flicking the
          light switch. The room is instantly flooded with light.
                         
          The room has stopped shaking. The screaming has stopped.
           75.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           Dalton!
                         
          Renai wrenches herself across the carpet and reaches Dalton's
          limp body.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Dalton! Dalton!
                         
          She listens for breathing. His chest moves. He is still
          breathing. She holds him and cries. More desperate than ever.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Tucker, Specs and Elise convene in the kitchen, slumped
          amongst the boxes for the tech gear. All are in shock.
                         
                          SPECS

           what.
                         
          He holds up his video camera.
                         
                          TUCKER (CONT'D)
           Watch this.
                         
          He hits play on a monitor that his video camera is cabled to.
          Chaotic images of Dalton from the previous scene SPIT to life.
                         
          BEHIND DALTON, we can just make out the blurry image of the
          RED-FACED DEMON. Puppeteering Dalton from behind. Controlling
          his limbs like a human marionette.

           evidence of the real thing. Proof.
                         
          He hits pause on the video, freeze-framing the hellish image.
           76.

           of the world believes that when you
           die, your soul ascends to sit with

           That is so not the point. This is not
           about religion. Here we have
           irrefutable evidence of a paranormal
           experience. Our job is to share it.

           No, our job is not to alert the press
           and prove the existence of the
           `paranormal', as you call it. I'm not
           out to prove anything. I've known
           there was a higher plane ever since I
           was a little girl and I could play
           hopscotch with people whose names
           were inscribed on tombstones. What
           you call paranormal is a fact of life

          She snatches his camera away from him and stands up.

          Josh sits with Renai's head in his lap. She is too
          traumatized to speak. Rain dribbles down the window pane.
                         
          Josh gets up when he hears the knock at the door. Elise
          shuffles over to answer it.
                         
          She opens the door to reveal Lorraine, wet from the downpour.
                         
          Elise steps aside and Lorraine walks in, gravely sedate.
                         
                          JOSH

                          ELISE
           I asked your mother to come over. I
           called her immediately after...the

           Why?
                         
          Lorraine's usual strong will has evaporated. She looks to Elise.
                         
                          ELISE
           There is something we must talk
           about. Sit down, Lorraine.
                         
          Lorraine follows orders, easing onto the sofa. Eyes down.
                         
          Thunder growls in the distance.

                          LORRAINE
           The reason...I knew to call Elise

           know her so well...is because I
           called her myself once. Years ago.

          Again we return to the opening scene...floating down a long
          hallway.
                         
          A window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach.
                         
          Someone is standing in front of it.

          The murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away. We
          follow it, tentative. Turning a corner, we see the figure.
          Standing in a doorway.
                         
          Now we can make out the edges of the figure. It is an old
          woman. Hair in a Victorian bun. A corseted dress.
                         
          IT IS THE SAME OLD WOMAN THAT ELISE SAW.

                          FLASHCUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Lorraine closes her eyes, struggling to go on.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           I dismissed your stories. Told you
           to grow up.
                          (BEAT)
           Then I saw her for myself.
                         
          She looks to Elise, who nods.
                         
          Hand trembling, Lorraine retrieves a packet from within her
          coat. The paper is yellowing. Faded. Soaked from the rain.
                         
          Lorraine hands the packet to Josh, who is dumbfounded.
                         
          Renai peers over Josh's shoulder, at a Polaroid of a boy,
          about nine years old, sitting on a couch. Early 70s period.
                         
          It is a Young Josh. Behind him is the BLURRED OUTLINE OF A
          FIGURE.
                         
          Josh runs his finger over the shadow. His heart rate speeds
          up. An old memory is coming back to him.
                         
                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)
           At first, I thought it was a camera
           problem. Then I saw her again.
                         
          Josh flips to the next photo - it is another faded frame of
          Josh as a youngster. This time he stands in an old kitchen.
                         
          Once again, there is a figure behind him - clearer this time,
          but still hidden in silhouette. A step closer to Josh.
                         
          Josh flips to the next picture. A BLACK AND WHITE shot of
          himself as a young boy, lying in bed.
           80.
                         
                         
          With dread, Josh sees the unmistakable features of an OLD
          WOMAN, crouching beside his bed. Staring at him.
                         
                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)
           In each photo, she got closer and
           closer to you...
                         
          Josh flips to the next picture - in this one, Young Josh is
          standing by a car.
                         
          Behind him, the details of the Old Woman's dress are visible.
          Her arm is extended...reaching out for Josh's neck.
                         
          Renai's hand flies to her mouth.
                         
                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)
           Finally, I was so scared, I called
           Elise.
                         
          Sweat pours down Josh's brow.
                         
          He lets the photographs flutter from his fingers, backing
          away. Fragments of memories rock his entire body.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't...I don't remember any of
           this...
                         
                          ELISE
           You've blocked it out.
                          (BEAT)
           But in the back of your mind,
           you're still afraid of having your
           picture taken, aren't you?
                         
          Josh grabs the wall, weak at the knees.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           I've kept the photos hidden ever
           since then...until tonight.
                         
                          ELISE
           I advised Lorraine to hide them. To
           stop taking your picture. And to
           let you forget.
                         
                          JOSH
           Who is she?
                         
                          ELISE
           A parasite. She befriended your
           astral body, then drew you out into
           The Further, just as Dalton has
           been drawn out.
                          (MORE)
           81.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           But she deceived you. All she
           wanted was an empty vessel. A
           physical body. Yours.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           I'm sorry, Josh.
                         
                          ELISE
           I didn't want to make you remember
           this...I only do it for the sake of
           your son.
                         
          A quiet descends over them.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Your son is out there.
                          (BEAT)
           And you are the only one who can
           bring him back.
                         
          Josh looks up at her.
                         
                          JOSH
           How long do we have before...that
           thing...takes him over completely?
                         
          All eyes are on Elise.
                         
                          ELISE
           If you cannot reach him tonight,
           then he is gone forever.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER
                         
          The lights have been dimmed. Josh sits on a single person
          lounge chair.
                         
          Elise sits opposite him.
                         
          Tucker and Specs set up around her, fixing their cameras in
          place. Renai leans forward on the couch opposite, chewing her
          nails to the quick. Lorraine is next to her.
                         
                          ELISE
           Remember who you are and why you
           are traveling. Keep one foot in
           this world.
                          (BEAT)
           Are you ready?
                         
          Josh nods. Renai hugs him and they hold onto it. She whispers
          to him, staring into his eyes.
           82.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           I want you to know something...you
           have never been less than good
           enough for me. You've always been
           perfect for me. You're my best
           friend...my soulmate. I love you so
           much.
                         
                          JOSH
           I love you too. I have since the
           first time you looked at me. I
           don't exist without you.
                         
          Elise drifts over to the piano, lifting the METRONOME from it.
                         
          She sets it down in front of Josh, freeing the weighted swing-
          arm so it moves back and forth.
                         
          TICK...TICK...TICK.
                         
                          ELISE
           Close your eyes, Josh...and relax.
           Breathe deeply. Let all life around you
           fade out into the background...until
           the only thing you can hear is the
           ticking of the metronome.
                         
          We PUSH IN on Josh, inhaling and exhaling. TICK...TICK...TICK.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Focus on a spot in the center of
           your forehead. Feel that spot
           getting further away as you drift
           off to sleep.
                         
          We are now in an ECU of Josh. TICK...TICK...TICK.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           I want you to relax your physical
           body and let the astral body gain
           strength...feel it rising out of
           your chest.
                         
          Renai watches, literally and figuratively on the edge of her
          seat. Tucker and Specs take notes from the corner.
                         
          Josh breathes deeply. Eyes shut tightly.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Detach yourself.
                         
          Josh's eyes open suddenly and he stands up, frustrated,
          marching across the living room.
           83.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           This is useless...I have no idea
           what I'm doing and you just
           suddenly expect me to...
                         
          He turns around and stops dead. His words trail off.
                         
          HE IS LOOKING AT HIMSELF.
                         
          He sees his own body, sitting in the armchair, eyes closed.
          Elise is sitting opposite, with her back to the Josh who is
          now standing.
                         
          The living room is exactly as it was - only Renai, Lorraine,
          Tucker and Specs have disappeared. They are nowhere to be
          seen.
                         
          Stunned into mute shock, Josh stares at his own body in the
          armchair.
                         
          Slowly, Elise turns her head away from the Josh in the chair,
          staring eerily into the standing Josh's eyes.
                         
          She can see him.
                         
                          ELISE
                          (SOFTLY)
           Now you are free.
                          (BEAT)
           Keep your guide, and a steady
           stride...and into The Further you
           go.
                         
          She turns back to the Josh in the chair. The room seems to
          have darkened even more somehow.
                         
          Josh turns and glares into the darkness of his hallway as it
          yawns outwards, eventually swallowed by complete blackness.
                         
          He is not in another world. He is in his own house.
                         
          NOTE - The following scenes are not going to be "movie
          quiet". They will be inhumanly quiet. There will no score.
          Only sound scape. This is another world and should feel so.
                         
          Josh moves forward, gliding down the hall slowly. He looks
          down and sees that his feet are slighty raised off the
          ground.
                         
          He is floating.
                         
          He moves into the darkness of the hall...past the bedroom
          doors and closet doors.
           84.
                         
                         
          As he floats past, he scans every darkened corner for the
          slightest trace of movement.
                         
          He reaches the front door. He moves towards it and as he does
          it OPENS.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE FURTHER - NOT NIGHT OR DAY, BUT DARK
                         
          His street beckons beyond the door.
                         
          Josh floats across his lawn.
                         
          There are no people or cars on the street...it is as desolate
          as a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
                         A
                         TOTAL
                         ABSENCE
                         OF
          LIFE.
                         
          Some lights flicker from within the houses, but no movement
          or signs of human forms. Only mist.
                         
          Josh floats an inch above the road, moving down the street.
                         
          One thing to notice is that there is a total lack of horizon
          or city scape here...Josh's immediate surroundings are
          visible for about one hundred yards or so...anything beyond
          that, in any direction, fades into blackness. As if someone
          were shining a giant spotlight down on him.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Renai watches Josh. He is completely still...in a trance.
                         
          His eyelids flutter as his eyeballs probe in all directions
          underneath.
                         
                          ELISE
           He's in...
                         
                         
          EXT. THE FURTHER - NIGHT
                         
          Josh keeps moving, his fear registering, even in this world.
                         
          He looks down at his feet.
                         
          He is frustrated that he can't move any faster. He
          concentrates with fierce intensity--
                         
          --and then watches as his feet touch the ground.
           85.
                         
                         
          He is walking.
                         
          He starts to move faster, gaining control of his movement.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton?
                         
          The sound of his voice is strangely dead - as if he were
          inside a soundproof recording studio. There are no walls or
          angles for it to bounce off.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton? Where are you?
                         
          For a long time, there is nothing...
                         
          ...
                         
          ...then he sees it.
                         
          A figure...shrouded in shadow. Standing on the street corner
          with his back to Josh.
                         
          Josh moves towards the figure.
                         
          Closer. Closer.
                         
          The man abruptly turns the corner without looking back.
                         
          Josh glances around the corner. There is nobody there.
                         
          He continues down the street. He sees a little girl. Far in
          the distance, but close enough to focus on. She stands and
          stares...
                         
          ...then turns and walks away. Gone...like an apparition.
                         
          He looks to his right and sees--
                         
          --A SHADOW.
                         
          Behind a curtain in one of the windows, back lit by candle
          light. As with the others, the shadow turns away and
          disappears.
                         
          Josh walks towards the front door of the house. He reaches it
          and turns the handle.
                         
                         
          INT. HOUSE - THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A long corridor beckons. As with all of this world, it is
          dark here.
           86.
                         
                         
          Josh walks into the corridor, looking to his left and right
          into empty rooms. Living rooms and bedrooms. Devoid of life.
                         
          The colors are muted...the palate drained. Only REDS and
          BLACKS pop out. Blood and darkness.
                         
          Josh keeps moving down the corridor.
                         
          Up ahead, he sees a figure run past the top of the hall,
          ignoring Josh.
                         
          He presses forward, following the figure.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton?
                         
          He glances into an empty kitchen. Food rots on the table.
                         
          His footsteps have no sound as he continues on.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton?
                         
          He passes a door that is partly open. He pushes it wide open.
                         
                         
          INT. SMALL ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The room is small and empty. A strange room...like a stage.
                         
          A figure is sitting in the corner, facing the wall like a
          child being punished at school.
                         
          Josh steps closer, cautious. Takes another step.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where is Dalton?
                         
          He steps closer yet again.
                         
          His hand reaches out to touch the figures back...
                         
          ...his fingers are almost grazing the figures shoulder.
                         
          Soft laughter behind him. Josh glances back to look for the
          source.
                         
          When he turns back, the FIGURE IS GONE.
                         
          He wheels around, seeing the small-statured figure of the
          DWARF that Renai encountered, stepping through the door of
          the room.
           87.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh sidles back into the corridor. His pace is sluggish,
          dream-like.
                         
          Frustrated, he stops. Then turns to his left.
                         
          SOMEONE IS RIGHT THERE IN HIS FACE. A MAN.
                         
          The man is not looking at him...only standing very close. His
          neck lolls on his shoulders...around and around. He seems
          stuck on a loop. He is dressed in a fifties era suit.
                         
                          JOSH
           Do you know where Dalton is?
                         
          The man doesn't acknowledge him.
                         
                          MAN
           Why do I have to put up with you?
           What a tramp. You call this a home?
           I work all day for this?
                         
          He marches away, leaving Josh standing alone.
                         
          Josh keeps going, whirling around. He reaches a set of stairs.
          The stairs descend into darkness.
                         
          Josh squints into the dark, afraid.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton? Where are you?
                         
          The low rumble of this place is the only reply. Josh turns to
          walk away. A distant voice stops him.
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Dad...
                         
          Josh SNAPS back.
                         
          The voice drifted from out of the darkness at the bottom of
          the stairs.
                         
          Josh scurries down the creaky ramp towards it.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The core of a rotten apple. The bowels of hell.
                         
          Drenched in shadow, Josh fumbles forward into yet another
          corridor of this labyrinth.
           88.
                         
                         
          He realizes he knows where he is. He is in his OLD HOUSE. An
          alternate world version of it.
                         
          The lighting is different - it's darker. There are no signs
          of life. Water drips somewhere.
                         
          Josh stumbles forward, seeing an open door.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh slinks into a darkened and dilapidated living room.
                         
          There are THREE PEOPLE in here - a middle aged woman, a middle
          aged man and a young girl. They are all FROZEN, standing in
          place as if someone had hit the pause button on their life.
                         
          The woman is in the middle of ironing. The man is sitting in an
          arm chair reading a newspaper. The girl is lying on the floor.
                         
          The whole scene looks like a macabre `Leave It To Beaver'
          tableau - a cheerful family frozen in time.
                         
          Josh steps closer to the mother...
                         
          ...hairs prickling up on his neck when he sees her BLINK. Her
          body moves slightly. She is not frozen - merely playing
          statues. Like a street performer keeping as still as possible.
                         
          Josh turns to the father. He is the same. His hand shakes,
          struggling to hold the newspaper in place.
                         
          He backs away from them, truly creeped out. His back hits a
          window and he turns, peering through the glass down at the
          street below.
                         
          A figure, hidden in silhouette, is gazing up at him.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh stalks into a kitchen off the living room. A weathered
          door is adjacent to the kitchen.
                         
          The door is ajar.
                         
          Through it, Josh can see somebodies leg.
                         
          Josh approaches the door, prodding it open gently with his
          finger.
                         
          It is a bedroom. A tattered cot sits against the wall. A
          YOUNG MAN (17) sits on the cot, holding a rifle. Like the
          others, he is trying to be completely still, as if on pause.
           89.
                         
                         
          He is having more trouble than the family, trembling
          slightly.
                         
                          JOSH
           I'm looking for my son, Dalton.
                         
          The boy does not look up. Does not move.
                         
          Josh retreats, scanning the kitchen. There are soiled pots in
          the sink. Rotting food, but no bugs. Josh turns the faucet
          but no water comes forth.
                         
          When he turns back, the YOUNG MAN is gone. No longer in his
          bedroom.
                         
          Josh glances back at the living room.
                         
          The Young Man is now standing inside the living room.
                         
          Again, he is frozen. Holding his rifle. Looking down at his
          family, who are now splayed out on the carpet, soaked in
          BLOOD.
                         
          Each of them has a bullet hole in their head.
                         
          Repulsed, Josh tip-toes past them. He looks down at the
          mother - a bullet wound in the center of her chest.
                         
          She blinks...still playing dead.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          More corridors disappearing into darkness.
                         
          Josh wrenches his hair in frustration. He boils over,
          screaming at the top of his lungs.
                         
                          JOSH
           DALTON!!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!!!
                         
          His cry recedes into nothingness.
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Dad....
                         
          He heard that. Excited, he spins around, trying to determine
          where it came from.
                         
          As he does, he sees that the entire dead family is now
          gathered at the door to the living room. Watching him.
                         
          He summons all his strength and starts running, backing away
          from them.
           90.
                         
                         
          He drives himself to move faster and faster.
                         
                          JOSH
           DALTON!
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Dad...help me...
                         
                          JOSH
           DALTON!!
                         
          A figure suddenly appears at the end of the hallway.
                         
          It is the LONG HAIRED MAN IN THE GREY JACKET. The man who
          terrorized Renai.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN
           I hear you...
                         
          He approaches.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
           I hear you, but you don't know what
           you've done.
                         
          He licks his lips.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
           There is a place that you can't go
           to and this is that place.
                         
          He is only a few yards from Josh now. He SCREAMS with awesome
          power, his spit flying.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
           YOU MADE A MISTAKE!! I'M GOING TO
           MAKE SUFFERING A FUCKING BLESSING
           FOR YOU! I'M GOING TO RIP YOU APART
           YOU CUNT!!
                         
          He CHARGES at Josh, screaming with hellfire fury.
                         
          Josh recoils, falling onto the floor, screaming.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Josh's body JOLTS in the chair and he makes a noise somewhere
          between a scream and a moan.
                         
                          RENAI
           What's happening to him?!
                         
          Elise leans in, attempting to communicate with Josh.
           91.
                         
                         
                          ELISE
           You're stronger then they are,
           Josh. You are a living soul!
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          Josh struggles. The Long Haired Man attacks him viciously.
                         
          Then something changes in Josh - he gets angry.
                         
                          JOSH
           Get...off..me!
                         
          He shoves the Long Haired Man back, pounding into him with
          the strength of TEN MEN.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Get away from me! Leave now!
                         
          Frightened, the Long Haired Man retreats, backing away until
          he is swallowed up by the blackness.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton!!
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
                          (STILL DISTANT)
           I'm here...
                         
          Josh follows the voice to another stairwell in this Escher-
          like maze of passageways.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton!
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Here...
                         
                         
          INT. BALLROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          From darkness into baroque extravagance.
                         
          Josh finds himself in a gilded chamber of long neglected
          opulence...as if a palace had been stormed, the occupants
          murdered and the place left to rot.
                         
          Mold caked pillars support a ceiling of gold flakes, the rest
          having rotted way.
                         
          Mirrors line the walls, their surface too clouded to see into.
           92.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton...?
                         
          He weaves between pillars, finally coming across a figure,
          slumped on the floor in the corner like a dog.
                         
          It is Dalton.
                         
          Josh runs to him. His foot is chained to a PIPE behind him,
          the clamp binding his right ankle. He looks pale and sick. He
          looks like one of them.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I'm taking you back.
                         
          He sees that Dalton is terrified. Looking over Josh's
          shoulder.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           What is it?
                         
          He glances back, spotting an open door at the end of the
          ballroom, light spilling from within it.
                         
          There is somebody inside.
                         
                         
          INT. MAKE-UP ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A grotesque form sits in front of an immense gold-rimmed
          mirror at a baroque powder table.
                         
          It is the RED-FACED creature seen by Elise.
                         
          The creature daubs RED LIPSTICK onto its face, arching
          forward, glaring into the mirror, caking the make-up on.
                         
          The room is littered with hundreds of discarded CHILDREN'S
          TOYS - teddy bears, stuffed animals, dolls (including one
          white-faced, black-haired doll we recognize). They are
          scattered about like bones, collecting dust in the shadows.
                         
          Suddenly the creature stops what it is doing. It sees
          something in the mirror.
                         
          What it sees is Josh.
                         
                         
          INT. BALLROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          With horror, Josh watches as the Red-Faced Man stands up and
          staggers to the door, peering through the crack at him.
                         
          Josh wrestles to free Dalton's leg from the chain. No good.
           93.
                         
                         
          Behind them the Red Faced Man opens the door. A rage unknown
          to humans is building up inside the creature. He hisses.
                         
                          DALTON
           Help me, dad...take this off me...
                         
          The creature steps closer. Taking his time. Drool seeping
          from his mouth with each drunken, wayward lope.
                         
                          JOSH
           You're not really here. You're
           asleep in your bed in our home.
           Just stand up.
                         
                          DALTON
           He's going to hurt me again...
                         
                          JOSH
           This isn't real. You can do this.
                         
                          DALTON
           He's coming!
                         
                          JOSH
           Just stand up!
                         
          Dalton does - and suddenly finds that the chain is no longer
          attached to his foot.
                         
          The Red Faced Man ROARS and the power of his breath sends
          them FLYING BACK.
                         
                          RED-FACED MAN
           This...issssss....real!
                         
          Josh smashes his head on a pillar, blood leaking from his
          head. The power of this demon far outweighs the others.
                         
           RED-FACED MAN (CONT'D)
           That...issss...my....boy!
                         
          Josh scrambles to his feet and snatches up Dalton, carrying
          him to the door as the Red Faced Man pursues.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Josh convulses in the chair, choking.
                         
                          RENAI
           Help him!
           94.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          Josh surges down a corridor, carrying Dalton.
                         
          The Red-Faced Man hobbles up behind them, his rasping wheeze
          growing in volume.
                         
                          RED-FACED MAN
           You're here now! With ussss!
                         
          Josh stampedes through the front door of the house - but
          instead of the street, he is facing another corridor.
                         
          They spill into the second corridor, running again, racing
          past rows and rows of doors.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Josh twitches in his chair, sweat beading on his forehead.
                         
                          JOSH
                          (MOANING)
           ....ome....onnnnn...
                         
          Elise paces in front of him.
                         
                          ELISE
           They've made contact. I know it.
           He's found your son.
                         
                          RENAI
           What happens now?
                         
                          ELISE
           We need them to come back. We need
           him to find us.
                         
          Tucker's equipment begins to shake on the table. The hanging
          light above them quivers as if an earthquake were rattling it.
                         
          A force is building in the room.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          As Josh and Dalton streak down the corridor, each door opens
          and a different figure staggers out.
                         
          Grotesque figures...the solemn dead. Pale skin, hollow eyes.
          Their dead eyes drill into Josh's soul.
                         
          They want what he has - life.
           95.
                         
                         
          They begin running - chasing Josh. Dozens of them.
                         
          Josh stops, seeing that the corridor seemingly has NO END. He
          yells in frustration.
                         
                          JOSH
           I want to get out!
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Josh's body SHUDDERS, the cry escaping his lips.
                         
                          JOSH
           ....eeeeet out!
                         
          The room trembles again. Elise looks to Renai.
                         
                          ELISE
           Call out to him!
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          Josh whips around, desperate.
                         
                          DALTON
           Listen!
                         
          Josh follows the order - and hears it. A faint shout. A siren
          call from another world.
                         
           RENAI (V.O.)
                          (DISTANT)
           Josh, follow my voice...
                         
          The voice seems to come from behind the door in front of
          Josh. He shoves it open--
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Renai glares at Josh's eyelids...as if he can see her through
          them.
                         
                          RENAI
           Follow my voice. Come back to us.
                         
          The room stops trembling. All is very still.
                         
          For a moment, it is as if time has stopped. Nuclear silence.
          Then...a drawer slides open in the corner of the room.
                         
          Lorraine and Renai gasp at this supernatural interruption.
           96.
                         
                         
          Specs clambers to his feet, approaching the drawer. It
          contains a note pad and nothing else.
                         
          He reaches out to close it...and then JOLTS as a HAND reaches
          out from within it!
                         
          He FLAILS backwards in fright, watching as the hand wrenches
          a mop of hair into view.
                         
          A FULL GROWN BODY BEGINS TO CLAW its way out of the drawer!
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          Drawers in Dalton's room slide open in unison. Then cabinets.
          The closet BURSTS open.
                         
          Pale adult bodies begin to claw their way out of the
          different doors, undulating out of impossibly small spaces
          and falling onto the floor like limbless insects.
                         
          Cracks are opening in our world and the miserable dead are
          slithering through the fissures.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          More doors shoot open - cabinets, closets, the pantry. Forced
          by unseen hands.
                         
          More hideous forms wrench themselves out into our world.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          Josh is exhausted, pushing himself to the limits.
                         
          He hears the voice again - distant and small. An echo.
                         
           RENAI (V.O.)
           Find us...
                         
          Josh follows the voice to a door.
                         
          He staggers towards it, still supporting Dalton. He slams the
          door open, falling through it into--
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT, LAMBERT HOME, THE FURTHER
                         
          -- the empty basement.
                         
          He is in the basement of his old house. The wooden steps
          beckon above him.
           97.
                         
                         
          Renai's voice cries out from behind the door at the top of
          the stairs.
                         
           RENAI (V.O.)
           Hurry! Come back to us!
                         
                          DALTON
           Put me down, I can run!
                         
          Josh sets Dalton down, who scampers up the stairs. Josh is
          about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar face.
                         
          THE OLD WOMAN.
                         
          She leers at Josh through the window of the basement, her
          visage spookily flecked in candlelight.
                         
          Josh is transfixed.
                         
                          DALTON (CONT'D)
           Come on, dad! Come on!
                         
                          JOSH
           Go! I'm right behind you!
                         
          Dalton charges ahead as Josh glares back at this face from
          his past.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You...what do you want from me?
                         
          The old woman's eerily unblinking gaze cuts through Josh. A
          long dormant rage BOILS OVER inside him. He approaches the
          window, vomiting fury at her.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Get the fuck away from me! I'm not
           scared of you, just leave me alone!
           Get away from me!
                         
          The old woman's lips protract to unveil a yellow graveyard of
          molars. A smile to buckle the steeliest nerve.
                         
          She raises a lit candle to her lips.
                         
          She snuffs out the plume with a single puff...plunging the
          basement into darkness.

          Specs staggers back as the skeletal figures emerging from the
          cabinets ambulate into the living room, surrounding Josh.

           Check on the boy!
                         
          Specs sprints out of the room.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, LAMBERT HOME, THE FURTHER
                         
          We are now locked into a POV shot, pushing down the corridor
          of the Lambert's NEW HOUSE. The scene of the trance.
                         
          Our POV is bee-lining for Dalton's bedroom.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT, LAMBERT HOME, THE FURTHER
                         
          In another POV shot, we SURGE up the basement stairs.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, NEW HOUSE, THE FURTHER
                         
          Our POV is only a few yards from Dalton's bedroom door.
                         
          The Red-Faced Man appears at the opposite end of the hall.
          Malevolent. Cruel.
                         
          He SCREAMS and flits towards us.
                         
          The POV keeps going, hitting the bedroom door and FLINGING IT
          OPEN - seeing DALTON'S BODY sleeping inside.
                         
          We SOAR towards it, getting closer--
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Specs stands over Dalton's body.
                         
          SUDDENLY - Dalton shudders, his legs spasm. His eyes FLICK
          open and he SUCKS IN A HUGE BREATH.
                         
                          SPECS
           He's awake!
                         
          Dalton sits up, panting. Renai charges into the room. He
          looks at her, registering her appearance.
                         
                          DALTON
           Mom...
           99.
                         
                         
          Renai literally throws herself at him, wrapping her arms
          around his body. No words can express.
                         
          Renai scoops him up, carrying him out of the bedroom.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, NEW HOUSE, THE FURTHER
                         
          The second POV whooshes down the corridor, zeroing in on the
          living room.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A scene of desperation.
                         
          Elise leans into Josh's face.
                         
          The living room is now filled with the CREEPING FORMS of the
          souls who crawled out from within the drawers. All of them
          marching towards Josh.
                         
                          ELISE
           Find me, Josh! Now! Wake up!
                         
          The closest entity reaches out with gnarled fingers and is
          almost touching Josh--
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE, THE FURTHER
                         
          The POV shoots towards Josh's body, seconds away--
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          Josh's eyes BURST OPEN and he inhales a chest full of air, as
          if emerging from deep water.
                         
          He falls forward, his strength gone.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh? Josh?
                         
          He pants on the floor, barely able to speak.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton...?
                         
          Dalton and Renai pounce on him.
                         
          Josh holds onto Dalton like he's a life preserver, and in a
          way, for Josh, he is. He laughs, inhaling deeply.
           100.
                         
                         
          Specs, Elise and Tucker approach. Renai sees them and stands
          up, tearful. She is lost for words.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't know what to say...
                         
          She rushes forward and hugs all three of them.
                         
                          ELISE
           Well put.
                         
          Josh brings Lorraine in they all embrace in a circle. A group
          hug for the ages.
                         
                          JOSH
           Now this is worth dying for.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          It's over.
                         
          Specs and Tucker haul a large tripod case to their van,
          heaving it into the back.
                         
          They stand in awkward silence. It's been a long day.
                         
                          TUCKER
           I guess you did some pretty awesome
           stuff in there. You deserve some
           credit.
                         
                          SPECS
           You did good too in an assistant-
           type way.
                         
          Tucker can't hold his stoic pose any longer. He breaks out
          laughing, followed quickly by Specs.
                         
                          TUCKER
           Thanks, boss.
                         
          They shake hands.
                         
                          TUCKER (CONT'D)
           Dude, I got some amazing shots. We
           are gonna write a book and my shots
           are gonna be the main selling point.
                         
                          SPECS
           Yeah.
                          (BEAT)
           Not the main selling point, but
           definitely important, for sure.

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Renai lie with Dalton on her bed.
                         
                          DALTON
           I'm tired.
                         
                          RENAI
           Too bad. I'm never letting you go
           to sleep again.
                         
          She runs her fingers through his hair.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Did you know we'd come and find you?
                         
          Dalton nods.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Whenever you're lost...we'll always
           come and find you.
                         
          They hug.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Josh wanders out of the kitchen, examining the house as if
          seeing it for the first time. He is smiling...happier than we
          have ever seen him.
                         
          Elise sits on the couch amongst the remains of Tucker's
          paraphernalia of the paranormal. Josh approaches her,
          standing over her.
                         
                          JOSH
           You introduced me to a new world.
                         
                          ELISE
           No. You've been there before,
           remember? And you'll go back.
                          (BEAT)
           All of us will...eventually.
                         
                          JOSH
           Maybe I can forget again.
                         
          He reaches into his jacket, taking out the eerie photos
          Lorraine gave him of himself as a child.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I'll start by giving these back.
           102.
                         
                         
          As he hands them to Elise, she sees with fear that his hand
          is withered and wrinkled.
                         
          Like the hand of an eighty year old woman.
                         
          Shocked, she looks up at his face.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?
                         
          Elise stands. She looks haunted. Her eyes wide and unnerved.
                         
                          ELISE
           Nothing, I...
                         
          She turns away, reaching for something.
                         
                          JOSH
           What's the matter, Elise?
                         
          She spins around and lifts Tucker's camera up to her face,
          aiming it at him. She depresses the trigger and takes a photo
          of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light.
                         
          Josh recoils back in shock. Elise lowers the camera. She is
          terrified. Josh suddenly LUNGES at her, slapping the camera
          out of her hands.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Why the fuck would you do that? Why
           would you do that? Why?!
                         
          He SLAMS her against the wall, his hands around her throat.
                         
          Elise chokes in terror, terrified of him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You of all people! You know! Why
           would you do that to me when you
           know what you know? You bitch!
                         
          He abruptly stops attacking her, staggering backwards,
          examining his hands as if he can't believe what he's done.
          Seething with fury. Panting.
                         
          Elise collapses, catching her breath.
                         
          Josh swipes a framed photo off the wall and storms away,
          heading down the corridor...
                         
          ...swallowed up by the darkness.
           103.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          Renai furrows her brow.
                         
                          RENAI
           What was that?
           (beat; to Dalton)
           Stay here.
                         
          She gets up.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Renai jogs into the living room. Sees Elise lying on the
          floor.
                         
                          RENAI
           Elise, what was that noise?
                         
          Elise simply looks up at her. The utter terror on her face is
          palpable. Her neck is bleeding from scratch marks.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Jesus...what happened to you?
                         
          Elise just stares, unable to speak. Her fear is contagious.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Where's Josh?
                          (BEAT)
           Josh? Josh?!
                         
          She turns and runs into the corridor, flicking on the lights.
                         
          There is nobody there.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai dashes from room to room in the hallway, pitching each
          door open.
                         
          Each room is empty. Josh is nowhere to be found.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          Elise stares at Tucker's camera in a state of catatonic dread.
                         
          Renai backs into the room, her own fear rising in her gut.
          She leans down and grabs Elise by the shoulders.
           104.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           Elise, what happened? You're
           scaring me, tell me where Josh is?
                         
          Elise finally looks up at her. Seeing the "expert" so afraid
          unnerves Renai. When the lion-tamer drops his whip and runs,
          you know the lion is vicious.
                         
          Elise opens her mouth to speak...but nothing comes out.
                         
          Instead, she simply holds up the camera, showing Renai the
          digital display of the photo she took.
                         
          We do not see it.
                         
          We simply see the look of horror on Renai's face.
                         
                          FLASHCUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
                         
          We have returned to the previous scene - only now we are
          seeing it through Elise's eyes.
                         
          Elise is sitting on the couch, alone. Trying to recover from
          the nights events.
                         
          She glances up when Josh approaches her.
                         
                          JOSH
           You introduced me to a new world.
                         
                          ELISE
           No. You've been there before,
           remember? And you'll go back.
                          (BEAT)
           All of us will...eventually.
                         
                          JOSH
           Maybe I can forget again.
                         
          Once again, we see him reach into his jacket, taking out the
          photos Lorraine gave him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I'll start by giving these back.
                         
          As he hands them to Elise, she sees with fear that his hand
          is withered and wrinkled.
                         
          Shocked, she looks up at his face.
           105.
                         
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?
                         
          Elise stands up, not knowing how to react.
                         
                          ELISE
           Nothing, I...
                         
          She turns away, reaching for something. We see her scoop up
          Tucker's digital camera.
                         
                          JOSH
           What's the matter, Elise?
                         
          She spins around and lifts Tucker's camera up to her face,
          aiming it at him. She depresses the trigger and takes a photo
          of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light.
                         
          --and in that split second, Josh is replaced by the Old
          Woman!
                         
          Elise lowers the camera, horrified. For a beat, the Old Woman
          just glares at her...
                         
          ...then she CHARGES at Elise, arms outstretched, wrapping her
          white hands around the soft flesh of Elise's throat.
                         
          Elise CHOKES, eyes bulging, spittle flying from her mouth, as
          the pale hands of the Old Woman dig into her thorax, droplets
          of blood running down her chest where the yellowing finger-
          nails have CUT IN to the flesh.
                         
          The Old Woman smiles - a merciless harlequin grin that mocks
          Elise's pain.
                         
          She lets Elise go, letting her drop to the floor.
                         
          The Old Woman turns and glares down the corridor. Something
          has caught her attention. A distant scream.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The door groans open, a blade of light penetrating pitch
          black darkness.
                         
          The silhouette of the Old Woman floats ethereally into the
          bathroom. She steps up to the mirror, then reaches into her
          tattered Victorian dress and produces a candle.
                         
          She lights the candle with a match, holding it beneath her
          chin and glaring into the reflective surface of the mirror.
           106.
                         
                         
          Instead of seeing her own reflection though, she sees THROUGH
          the mirror as if it were a window.
                         
          In it, she can see the BASEMENT of the Lambert's previous
          residence.
                         
          Josh bursts into the basement, carrying Dalton.
                         
                          DALTON
           Put me down, I can run!
                         
          Josh sets Dalton down, who scampers up the stairs.
                         
          We are watching the same scene we saw earlier play out in the
          mirror.
                         
          Josh is about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar
          face. He looks at the Old Woman...seeing her through the
          `window'.
                         
                          DALTON (CONT'D)
           Come on, dad! Come on!
                         
                          JOSH
           Go! I'm right behind you!
                         
          Dalton disappears as Josh glares at the woman.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You...what do you want from me?
                         
          He approaches the mirror. WE CIRCLE AROUND the Old Woman,
          past the mirror and THROUGH THE BATHROOM WALL, emerging on
          the other side in--
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT, LAMBERT HOME, INSIDE THE FURTHER
                         
          --the basement.
                         
          Josh screams at the Old Woman as she stares at him through
          what he thinks is a window. THEY HAVE SWAPPED PLACES. He is
          now in The Further, and she is in our world.
                         
                          JOSH
           Get away the fuck away from me. I'm
           not scared of you, just leave me
           alone! Get away from me!
                         
          We KEEP CIRCLING, wiping past Josh's back and completing a
          360 degree turn, THROUGH THE WALL and back into--
           107.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --our world.
                         
          The Old Woman smiles at Josh's rage. She finds it amusing.
                         
          With an eerily unblinking gaze, she snuffs out the plume of
          flame with a single puff of breath...plunging the bathroom
          into darkness...
                         
          ...and snuffing out Josh forever...
                         
                         
                         
          ...and ever.
                         
           FADE OUT.

									 FADE IN:


	INT. ROOM - NIGHT (SAN FRANCISCO)

	A small bare room, illuminated only by the streetlight
	coming through the window.

	A hand presses a cassette into a recorder and fiddles
	with a small microphone.

	Malloy sits over a table fiddling with the tape. He is
	young, half-shaven, dressed in T-shirt and jeans. He
	looks too -

	LOUIS, who stands by the window, looking out on the
	street, with his back to Malloy. Louis is dressed in an
	old-fashioned suit.

				LOUIS
		So you want me to tell you the
		story of my life...

				MALLOY
		That's what I do. I interview
		people. I collect lives. F.M.
		radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed
		a genuine hero, a cop who -

				LOUIS
			(quietly interrupting)
		You'd have to have a lot of tape
		for my story. I've had a very
		unusual life.

				MALLOY
		So much the better. I've got a
		pocket full of tapes.

				LOUIS
		You followed me here, didn't you?

				MALLOY
		Saw you in the street outside. You
		seemed interesting. Is this where
		you live?

				LOUIS
		It's just a room...

				MALLOY
		So shall we begin?
			(playfully, almost
			teasing)
		What do you do?

				LOUIS
		I'm a vampire.

	Malloy laughs.

				MALLOY
		See? I knew you were interesting.
		You mean this literally, I take it?

				LOUIS
		Absolutely. I was watching you
		watching me. I was waiting for you
		in that alleyway. And then you
		began to speak.

				MALLOY
		Well, what a lucky break for me.

				LOUIS
		Perhaps lucky for both of us.

	Still in shadow he turns from the window and approaches
	the table.

				LOUIS
		I'll tell you my story. All of it.
		I'd like to do that very much.

	Malloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure,
	fascinated but afraid.

				MALLOY
		You were going to kill me? Drink my
		blood?

				LOUIS
		Yes but you needn't worry about
		that now. Things change.

	Louis stands opposite, hand on the chair. Malloy is
	riveted.

				MALLOY
		You believe this, don't you? That
		you're a vampire? You really
		think...

				LOUIS
		We can't begin this way. Let me
		turn on the light.

				MALLOY
		But I thought vampires didn't like
		the light.

				LOUIS
		We love it. I only wanted to
		prepare you.

	Louis pulls the chord of the overhead naked light bulb.


	LOUIS' FACE

	Appears inhumanly white, eyes glittering. Inhuman or
	not alive. the effect is subtle, beautiful and ghastly.

				MALLOY
		Good God!

	He struggles to suppress fear and understand.

				LOUIS
		Don't be frightened. I want this
		opportunity.

	The light appears to go out by itself and suddenly
	Louis is in the chair, dimly lit by the street-light
	from the window. The cassette is turning.

				MALLOY
		How did you do that?

				LOUIS
		The same way you do it. A series of
		simple gestures. Only I moved too
		fast for you to see. I'm flesh and
		blood, you see. But not human. I
		haven't been human for two hundred
		years.

	Malloy is speechless, frightened yet enthralled.

				LOUIS
		What can I do to put you at ease?
		Shall we begin like David
		Copperfield? I am born, I grow up.
		Or shall we begin when I was born
		to darkness, as I call it. That's
		really where we should start, don't
		you think?

				MALLOY
		You're not lying to me, are you?

				LOUIS
		Why should I lie? 1791 was the year
		it happened. I was twenty-four -
		younger than you are now.

				MALLOY
		Yes.

				LOUIS
		But times were different then. I
		was a man at that age. The master
		of a large plantation just south of
		New Orleans...

									 DISSOLVE
									 TO:


	EXT. LOUISIANA - DAY (1791)

	A disheveled Louis, hair in pigtail, in deep pocket
	frock coat, rides his horse through the fields of
	indigo, passing an overseer and slaves at work.

	He passes slave quarters and the distant colonial
	mansion of Pointe du Lac.

	He comes to a small parish church and a graveyard. he
	dismounts and walks through the tombs to an elaborate
	one in Greek Style.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I had just lost my wife in
		childbirth. She and the infant had
		been buried less than half a year.

	There is a marble angel above the tomb, feminine, with
	a tiny cherub angel in her arms. Louis looks from the
	angel, down to the inscriptions on the tomb:

	"DIANNE DE POINTE DU LAC 1763 - 1791
	INFANT JEAN MARIE - 1791"

	Louis rips away the vines already covering the
	inscription, then drinks from a pocket-flask. His face
	is ashen.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I was twenty-four and life seemed
		finished. I couldn't bear the pain
		of their loss. I longed for a
		release from it.


	INT. WATERFRONT TAVERN - NIGHT

	Louis in ragged lace and dirty brocade sitting between
	two whores at a gaming table, drinking absinthe. All
	around him flatboatmen, whores, gamblers, black African
	freedmen.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I wanted to lose everything. My
		wealth, my estate, my sanity. But
		Lady Luck didn't oblige.

	Louis displays a hand of four aces. A gambler at the
	table stands in fury, over turning money, cards,
	drinks.

				LOUIS
		You're calling me a cheat?

				GAMBLER
		I'm calling you a piece of shit -

	The Gambler pulls out a pearl-handled pistol and points
	it at Louis. The crowd hushes and draws back. Louis
	smiles drunkenly and stands. he rips open his lace
	shirt, exposing his chest.

				LOUIS
		Then do me a favor. Get rid of this
		piece of shit...

	The Gambler's finger on the trigger. His hand shakes.

				LOUIS
		You lack the courage of your
		convictions, sir. Do it.

	LESTAT, a hooded figure in the corner, smiles from
	beneath the shadow of his hood. Gleaming blue eyes.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Most of all I longed for death. I
		know that now. I invited it, a
		release from the pain of living...

	The Gambler lowers his gun, scowling. Louis pockets the
	fistfulls of coins he has won.


	EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

	Loud, crowded riverfront taverns full of ruffians.
	Louis staggers down, an arm around a whore, drinking
	from a bottle. A pockmarked pimp follows behind.

				LOUIS
		My invitation was open to anyone.
		Sailors, thieves, whores and
		slaves...


	EXT. WHARF - NIGHT

	Louis, quite insensible, being propped up against a
	wall by the whore in a dank wharf over the water. The
	pimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to
	slice his throat, when a shadow falls over him. He
	turns, and we see the face of Lestat, who lifts him
	into the air by his throat, breaking his neck. the
	whore screams and Lestat's other hand clamps over her
	mouth. Lestat drags her towards him. Louis falls to the
	ground, supported no more, insensible. Close on his
	face, as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore,
	off.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		But it was a vampire that accepted.


	IN THE WATER

	The bodies of the thief and whore float by. Above on
	the wharf, Louis, now awake, stares down at them. He
	turns, to see Lestat, towering above him.

				LESTAT
		They would have killed you -

				LOUIS
		Then my luck would have changed.

				LESTAT
		You want death? Is it death you
		want?

				LOUIS
		Yes...

	Lestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the
	air, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his
	teeth in his neck.


	ON LOUIS' FACE

	Every muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is
	drained from him.


	ON THEIR FEET

	Hovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers.

	THE WIND billows through the ghostly white sails and
	rigging of the boats around the wharf.


	LESTAT

	Floats higher, with Louis in his arms, draining his
	blood. One hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging
	from a shipmast. The other holds Louis. He withdraws
	his teeth, and looks into Louis' drained face.

				LESTAT
		You still want death? Or have you
		tasted it enough?

	Louis can barely get the words out.

				LOUIS
		Enough...

	Lestat smiles and lets him go. Louis falls and plummets
	into the water below.


	LOUIS' FACE

	Coming to the surface, in the water lapping by the
	wharf. The bodies of the whore and thief float beside
	him. He looks up and sees Lestat way above him,
	dangling from the rope of the shipmast.


	INT. ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO

	ON MALLOY'S FACE

	Captivated, terrified, enthralled.

				MALLOY
		That's how it happened?

				LOUIS
		No. The Gift of Darkness requires
		more than that, as you'll see.


	EXT. WATERFRONT - DAY

	Louis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish,
	the carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish.
	He gets to his feet and walks weakly through the
	mudflats. The sun is coming up over the sea behind him.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		He left me half dead that morning.
		he wanted something from me. He
		came back the following night.


	INT. LAVISH FRENCH-FURNISHED BEDROOM AT POINT DU LAC

	Louis is delirious in a four-poster bed, shrouded with
	mosquito netting. A female slave, YVETTE, bathes his
	face with a rag. She is crying. Other slave women hover
	in the shadows. Yvette puts out all candles save one by
	the bed, and withdraws, with the others.

	Candlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin.

	Louis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring
	incoherently. Then he opens his eyes.

	LESTAT, exquisitely dressed in French clothing, stands
	by the bed smiling. In the light of the candle we see
	that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright.
	Lestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible
	- and angel or monster.

	Louis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it.

				LOUIS
		Who the hell are you? What are you
		doing in my house?

				LESTAT
		And a beautiful house it is too.
		Yours is a good life, isn't it?

	Louis takes aim. Lestat puts his hand over the barrel.
	Louis fires. The bullet tears a hole in Lestat's hand.
	Lestat is unfazed. He takes the gun from Louis' hand
	and throws it away. His hand begins to heal.

				LESTAT
		You're not afraid of anything, are
		you?

				LOUIS
		Why should I be?

	Louis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and
	point it. Lestat laughs indulgently. He draws closer.

				LESTAT
		Are you going to put that through
		me too? Ruin my beautiful clothes?

	He comes closer to Louis, right up to his face, so the
	sword passes through his waistcoat.

				LESTAT
		Were all last night's promises for
		nothing?

	He reaches out with his now-healed hand and plucks out
	the sword.

				LOUIS
		What do you want from me?

				LESTAT
		I've come to answer your prayers.
		You want to die, don't you? Life
		has no meaning anymore, does it?

	Lestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. Louis
	is becoming spellbound.

				LESTAT
		The wine has no taste. The food
		sickens you. There seems no reason
		for any of it, does there? But what
		if I could give it back to you?
		Pluck out the pain and give you
		another life? And it would be for
		all time? And sickness and death
		could never touch you again?

	The vampire theme rises, with the sound of a heartbeat.

									 DISSOLVE
									 TO:


	EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

	The camera drifts through the graveyard where Louis'
	wife is buring. Everything is lit with an eerie glow,
	as if seen through some unearthly eye.

				LESTAT
		Vampires, that's what we are.
		Creatures of darkness, only we see
		it that darkness more clearly than
		any mortal has ever seen...

	Louis and Lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the
	overhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and
	child. Above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and
	child.

				LESTAT
		Wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain
		goodbye? To wave away anguish and
		grief? To embrace the peace of the
		unending night?

	The marble fingers of the child on the statue move. The
	angel raises her head and has the face of Louis wife,
	Diane. she raises her hand and touches Louis tear-
	streamed face. The child speaks.

				MARBLE CHILD
		Papa...

	Louis reaches out to embrace them and finds himself
	touching cold marble. He cries out in anguish-

				LOUIS
		Diane!!!!

				LESTAT
		They are gone, Louis. Death took
		them. Death which you can now
		destroy...

				LOUIS
		NO!!!!!


	INT. LOUIS BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Louis, thrashing on the bed in a delirium. Lestat
	places a hand on his forehead and soothes him.

				LESTAT
		You have to ask me for this. You
		have to want it, do you hear me?

				LOUIS
		Give it to me!!!

				LESTAT
		Vampires. We thrive on blood.

				LOUIS
		I want it!

	Lestat bends close as if to drink Louis' blood. Louis
	does not shrink back, but stares into his eyes. Lestat
	draws back, then stands up and goes to the French
	doors.

				LESTAT
		Tomorrow night. You must prove
		yourself. I will give you the
		choice I never had.

	He looks outside.

				LESTAT
		The sun's coming up. Watch it
		carefully. If you come with me
		tomorrow, you'll never see it
		again.

	He leaves. Louis sits dazed, staring at the empty
	French window. The sun rises with unnatural beauty,
	over the swamplands and the plantation, filling the
	room, striking water-pitcher, glass, mirror, and the
	picture of his dead wife.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		My last sunrise. That morning I was
		not yet a vampire, and I saw my
		last sunrise. I remember it
		completely, yet I don't remember
		any sunrise before it. I watched
		the whole magnificence of the dawn
		for the last time, as if it were
		the first. And the I said goodbye
		to sunlight and went out to become
		what I became.


	EXT. PLANTATION - NIGHT

	Lestat and Louis walk through the slave quarters,
	huddles groups around fires, music, singing. The sound
	of whipping is heard.

				LESTAT
		Your grief has unhinged you. You've
		let your estate rot.

	In the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is
	whipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery.

				LESTAT
		You let your overseer run riot,
		work your slaves to the bone. We'll
		start with him.

				LOUIS
		How do you mean, start?

				LESTAT
		Call him.

	Louis calls.

				LOUIS
		Carlos!!!

	The overseer turns and comes towards them, with the
	bloodied whip.

				LESTAT
		Why the bloody whip, Carlos?

	The overseer looks into his eyes, shivers with terror,
	drops the whip and runs for the trees. Lestat is on him
	in an instant. He sinks is teeth in his neck. Louis
	runs to him, tries to pull him off. But Lestat turns to
	Louis and smiles, with his bloodied mouth.

				LESTAT
		Let's call that a start.

				LOUIS
		I can't do it.

				LESTAT
		You've just done it -

				LOUIS
		Kill me if you will, but I can't do
		this...

	He flees, as Lestat ends to finish off the overseer.


	EXT. POINTE DU LAC - NIGHT

	Louis running up the steps leading to the gallery. He
	is crazed with guilt. He looks up and sees -


	LESTAT

	Sitting collected at the head of the steps.


	LOUIS

	Backs away as Lestat rises and descends the steps so
	fluidly he hardly seems to move.

				LESTAT
		Don't worry. He was white trash,
		they come at two a penny. I dumped
		him in the swamp and untied the
		slave, licked his wounds clean.

				LOUIS
		You're the devil, aren't you?
		That's who you are.

				LESTAT
			(gently)
		I wish I were. But if I were, what
		would I want with you?

				LOUIS
		I can't go through with it, I tell
		you.

				LESTAT
		Your perfect. Your bitter and
		you're strong.

				LOUIS
		But why do you want me?

				LESTAT
		Because you're as strong as I was
		when I was alive.

	Louis takes out his flask and drinks. Drunkenly, he
	turns and heads for a nearby swamp.


	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Louis stops again in front of the crypt. Drinks from
	the flask, leans his forehead against the stone.

	Lestat appears beside him, radiant, beautiful.

				LESTAT
		You really want to be with them?

				LOUIS
		Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you
		promised -

				LESTAT
		You asked for death. I didn't
		promise it -

	In a quiet rage, Lestat raise his fist and shatters the
	marble face stone, revealing a coffin below. His fist
	shatters that in turn, revealing the half-rotted body
	of a women, holding an infant, no longer recognizable
	as individuals, a tangle of gruesome rotted hair,
	flesh, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling over
	it.

	Louis gasps.

				LESTAT
		It's not your wife and child my
		friend. It's death. Just that
		simple. Think and choose. It
		happens to everyone. Except us.

	Lestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy
	dreamlike vision, then hyperclear. Louis again is
	spellbound. He drops the flask, which shatters on the
	stones.

	Lestat appears angelic in his radiance.

				LESTAT
		We shall be this way always, my
		friend. Young as we are now. I'm
		lonely for a companion, lonely for
		your strength. But I'm not that
		lonely. Do you want to come or not?

	Louis capitulates in one long sigh.

				LOUIS
		Yes...

	Lestat comes closer, smiling.

				LESTAT
		Did I hear a yes?

				LOUIS
		Yes...

	Lestat embraces Louis, obscuring his face. He drinks
	his blood. We hear two heartbeats, out of sync, coming
	together. We see Louis' face, growing paler, paler, as
	his blood is drained. His eyes stare upwards, losing
	their focus.


	LOUIS' POV

	The moon, through hanging vines. The marble statue of
	his wife and child smile at him, as if come alive. Her
	hair blows in the breeze, wonderful gold tresses, the
	child's fingers reach out...


	BACK TO SCENE

	Lestat lets Louis fall down beside the broken crypt.
	Louis looks from the rotting bodies to Lestat above
	him. radiant. Lestat speaks gently.

				LESTAT
		I've drained you to the point of
		death. If you drink from me you
		live for ever. If I leave you here
		you die.

	Lestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows Louis a
	kiss.

				LOUIS
		No. Don't leave me here. Give it to
		me.

	Lestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth. Fangs
	slash his own flesh, blood falls.

				LESTAT
		You're sure?

				LOUIS
		Sure...

	Louis rises to accept the first drops with his open
	mouth. Lestat gathers him up, as Louis clamps his hand
	on Lestat's arm and drinks from the wrist.

	The VAMPIRE THEME swells.

	Lestat watches him drink his wrist with wry amusement.
	Louis finishes, staggers away from him as if drunk.


	LOUIS' POV

	Vampire vision. The world is transformed, the swamp,
	the moon, the clouds, the cry of the night birds all
	come to him with unnatural clarity. He looks down with
	pity at the corpses of his wife and child who appear
	beautiful in death now rather than repulsive. He closes
	the lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground,
	astonished at the ease of it.

	He turns and stares at Lestat whom he sees now with
	vampire's vision. Lestat's eyes are brighter, his
	buttons are glimmering in the light. Everything is
	clearer, brighter, containing more facets of light and
	color.

				LESTAT
		Stop staring at my buttons. Didn't
		I tell you it was going to be fun?

	Lestat leads him into the swamp. Everything astonished
	Louis, as if he's never seen it before. Louis is
	suddenly racked by shudders of pain.

				LESTAT
		You're body's dying. Pay no
		attention. It will take twenty
		minutes at most.

				LOUIS
		Dying?

	Louis dry-retches.

				LESTAT
		It happens to us all.

	Lestat wipes Louis' brow.

				LESTAT
		Come, you're going to feed now.

				LOUIS
		I want a woman.

	Lestat laughs and his laughter echoes like bells in
	Louis' ears.

				LESTAT
		That doesn't matter anymore, Louis.
		You'll see. Come...


	LOUIS' VAMPIRE POV - SWAMP

	Small high ground. Camp of runaway slaves. Several
	share a bottle of rum around the fire. A male slave
	rises. A gorgeous hunk of flesh in the moonlight and
	goes into the swamp to relieve his bladder.

				LESTAT
		They're all beautiful now. Men,
		women, the old, the young...simply
		because they are alive. -

	The slave walks towards them in the darkness. A
	crucifix gleams round his neck.

				LESTAT
		Take him.

				LOUIS
		The crucifix -

				LESTAT
		Forget the crucifix. Take him.

	Louis hesitates.

				LESTAT
		Resist no more Louis. Feed...

	The slave looks up and sees them. Two gleaming white
	beings standing before him with devil's eyes. The he
	runs.

	Louis can resist him no more. He swoops on him with a
	vampire's rapid movement, brings him to the ground and
	sinks his teeth in his neck.

	Close on Louis feeding on the slave, the magnificent
	body shuddering in its death-throes. Lestat stands
	above, laughing.

	The slave dies. Louis rises from him, drunkenly,
	engorged with blood.

				LOUIS
		What have I done?

				LESTAT
		You have fed. You were made for
		this...

	Louis looks down at the body of the slave. Lestat's
	laughter echoes around him.

				LOUIS
		Dear God, what have I done?

				LESTAT
		You've killed Louis. And enjoyed
		it.

	Lestat laughs harder. Louis runs from him, screaming in
	anguish.


	EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

	Louis reaches his wife's grave. He falls to his knees,
	throws back his head and bares his new fangs to the
	moon.

				LOUIS
		Dear God, what have I become????


	INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

	Malloy stares at Louis, terrified and enthralled.

				MALLOY
		You said the slave had a
		crucifix...

				LOUIS
		Oh, that rumor about crosses?

				MALLOY
		You can't look at them...

				LOUIS
		Nonsense, my friend. I can look on
		anything I like. And I am
		particularly fond of looking on
		crucifixes.

				MALLOY
		The story about stakes through the
		heart?

				LOUIS
		The same. As you would say today...
		Bull shit.

				MALLOY
		What about coffins?

				LOUIS
		Coffins... coffins unfortunately
		are a necessity...


	EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

	Louis walks up the steps to the mansion. He looks now
	like a fully-fledged vampire. Yvette, the slave girl
	stares at him from the open doorway. Cascades of
	harpsichord music come from the interior.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Killing is no ordinary act. It is
		the experience of another's life
		for certain. That night I had lost
		my own life and taken another's. I
		was drowning in a sea of human
		guilt and regret, with all the
		heightened senses of a vampire...

	Louis enters the mansion, following the harpsichord
	music, as if in a dream. Yvette draws back as he
	approaches.


	INT. MANSION - NIGHT

	Louis wanders into the parlor, where Lestat is playing
	the harpsichord rapidly and exuberantly. Louis goes to
	a full-length mirror and sees his own reflection there
	- quite the perfect vampire.

				LESTAT
		Yes, that's you, my handsome
		friend. And you'll look that way
		till the stars fall from heaven.

				LOUIS
		It can't be...

				LESTAT
		Give it time. You're like a man who
		loses a limb and still imagines he
		feels pain. It will pass. And we
		must sleep now. I can feel the sun
		approaching.


	EXT. POINTE DU LAC

	Dawn spreading over the plantation.


	INT. BASEMENT - POINTE DU LAC

	A brick walled storage room. Two coffins stand on the
	floor. Lestat enters with a lantern, Louis behind.
	Lestat is apprehensive and protective of Louis. He
	pulls back one lid ot reveal a satin interior.

				LESTAT
		You must get into it. It's the only
		safe place for you when the light
		comes.

				LOUIS
		And if I don't?

				LESTAT
		The sun will destroy the blood I've
		given you. Every tissue, every
		vein. The fire in this lantern
		could do that too.

	Louis approaches the coffin, hands trembling as he
	peers into it.

				LESTAT
		Don't be afraid. In moments you'll
		be sleeping as soundly as you ever
		slept. And when you awake I'll be
		waiting for you, and so will all
		the world.

	Louis crawls into the coffin, fearful yet fascinated.

				LOUIS
		You told me something earlier. You
		said you didn't have a choice. Was
		that true?

	Lestat smiles bitterly and nods.

				LESTAT
		Someday I'll tell you. We have a
		lot of time to talk to each other.
		You might say... we have all the
		time we shall ever need.

	He closes the lid.

	Total darkness. Sounds of Louis' panicked breathing. Of
	his prayer again.

				LOUIS
		Dear God, what have I done?


	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	Louis and Lestat sitting at a sumptuous table, piled
	with uneaten food. Lestat is going through sheafs of
	documents.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I awoke the next evening to a
		different world. And I realized
		there are as profound differences
		between vampires as between human
		beings...

	Lestat, totting up figures on a piece of paper.

				LESTAT
		Your wealth, dear Louis, is
		inestimable. Your income from
		cotton alone will keep us in
		comfort for a century.

	Louis just stares at him.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I sat there staring at him with
		contempt. He had the soul of a
		shopkeeper, he was the sow's ear
		out of which nothing fine could be
		made. I felt sadly cheated in
		having him as a teacher...

	Lestat looks up at him and grins.

				LESTAT
		You'll get used to killing. Just
		forget about that mortal coil.
		You'll become accustomed to things
		all too quickly.

				LOUIS
		Do you think so?

	Yvette enters, stands behind him, staring at Lestat
	with loathing.

				YVETTE
		You are not hungry, sir...

				LESTAT
		Au contraire, my dear. He could eat
		a horse...

	Lestat laughs loudly. Louis turns and looks at Yvette.
	Her beautiful forehead in the candlelight, the veins
	pulsing on her neck and her hands.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I looked at anything mortal and saw
		all life as precious, condemning
		all fruitless guilt and passion
		that would let it slip through the
		fingers like sand...

	Yvette returns his stare, troubled.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		It was only as a vampire that I
		could see Yvette's beauty. Her fear
		of me increased my desire.

	Yvette reaches for his uneaten plate. Louis stops her
	hand. Holds it for a beat too long, looking at the
	veins in her wrist.

				LOUIS
		I will finish it, Yvette. Now leave
		us.

	She turns and runs from the table. Lestat leans towards
	him.

				LESTAT
		Can't you pretend, you fool? Don't
		give the game away. We're lucky to
		have such a home.

	His hand snakes out under the table. It comes up
	holding a large grey rat.

				LESTAT
		Pretend to drink, at least.

	He bares his fangs and slices the rat's throat. He
	pours the blood into a crystal glass.

				LESTAT
		Such fine crystal shouldn't go to
		waste...

	He hands the glass to Louis. Louis drinks the blood and
	stares at it in surprise, then at the dead rat on the
	fine lace tablecloth.

				LESTAT
		I know. It gets cold so fast.

				LOUIS
		We can live like this? Off the
		blood of animals?

	Lestat shrugs.

				LESTAT
		I wouldn't call it living. I'd call
		it surviving. A useful trick if
		you're caught for a month on a ship
		at sea.

	Lestat strokes the belly of the dead rat, studying it
	sadly.

				LESTAT
		There's nothing in the world now
		that doesn't hold some...

				LOUIS
		Fascination...

				LESTAT
		Yes. And I'm bored with this
		prattle -

	He throws the rat away.

				LOUIS
		But we can live without taking
		human life. It's possible.

				LESTAT
		Anything is possible. But just try
		it for a week. Come into New
		Orleans and let me show you some
		real sport!

	He rises. Louis follows.


	EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

	A big, lavish drinking place with a raised stage.

	Italian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude
	commedia dell'arte on the stage.

	Plantation owners in soiled brocade, lace, crooked wigs
	watch the show as tavern wenches move about.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		This was New Orleans, a magical and
		magnificent place to live. In which
		a vampire, richly dressed might
		attract no more notice in the
		evening than hundreds of other
		exotic creatures.

	Louis and Lestat by a table, in the shadow of a tree.
	Teresa, a tavern wench, sits on Lestat's lap, pouring
	drinks for the two of them. She lifts a fresh glass to
	Lestat's lips as he flirts with her.

				TERESA
		Come on, mon cher. The best in the
		colony. Once you touch this you'll
		never go to any other tavern again.

				LESTAT
		You think so, cherie? But what if
		I'd rather taste your lips?

				TERESA
		My lips are even sweeter still...

	She kisses him. He lets his tongue play with hers, then
	runs it down her neck. She swoons with pleasure. Then
	he sinks his teeth gently in her neck, looking
	playfully behind at Louis, who if appalled and
	fascinated.


	ANTICS ON THE STAGE

	Laughter rocks the tavern.

	Lestat slips the pale and dead Teresa into a chair
	beside him and folds her hands on the table. No one
	notices. He lays gold coins on the table and touches
	Louis' knee.

				LESTAT
		Let's get out of here!

	Lestat rushes out, thrilled with himself.


	EXT. TAVERN - NIGHT

	A crowded street. Louis and Lestat emerge from the
	tavern. Louis looks up at the moon.

				LOUIS
		Have you ever been caught?

				LESTAT
		Of course not. It's so easy you
		almost feel sorry for them.

	They walk down the crowded night street, full of ladies
	in their finery, freed slaves, whores, sailors etc.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Lestat killed two, sometimes three
		a night. A fresh young girl, that
		was his favorite for the first of
		the evening.


	INT. FRENCH QUARTER MANSION - BALLROOM

	Small orchestra plays for colonial couples in fine wig
	and garb prancing to a French minuet. Young women sit
	in chairs along the walls with their chaperones. Young
	men stand opposite.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		But the triumphant kill of Lestat
		was a young man. They represented
		the greatest loss to Lestat because
		they stood on the threshold of the
		maximum possibility of life.

	A youth of preternatural beauty, silhouetted against
	French windows. He is talking to an elegant widow,
	seated, holding two manicured poodles. Lestat stares at
	the youth with longing.

				LESTAT
		The trick is not to think about it.
		See that one? The widow St. Clair?
		she had that gorgeous young fop
		murder her husband. She's perfect
		for you. Go ahead.

				LOUIS
		But how do you know?

				LESTAT
		Read her thoughts.

				LOUIS
		I can't.

				LESTAT
		The dark gift is different for each
		of us. But one thing is true of
		everyone. We grow stronger as we go
		along.

	He leads Louis closer to them.

				LESTAT
		Take my word for it. She blamed a
		slave for his murder. And do you
		know what they did to him?

	He smiles at the young man, who smiles in return.

				LESTAT
		The evildoers are easier. And they
		taste better...


	EXT. LAWNS - NIGHT

	Lestat walks the youth towards a copse of trees. He
	looks back at Louis, who holds both poodles on a
	delicate leash, walking with the widow. The minuet
	spills from the french windows.

				WIDOW ST. CLAIR
		Now, young man, you really amaze
		me! I'm old enough to be your
		grandmother.

	She leans towards him concquettishly. Louis, crazed
	with hunger, sees her as beautiful in the moonlight. He
	allows her lips reach his. He takes her in his arms,
	gently, romantically, and sinks in his teeth. She
	swoons.

				WIDOW ST. CLAIR
		Yes, that's the melody, I remember
		it. Oh yes...

	Louis draws his lips away. She is weak in his arms, but
	still alive. He can't do it. The poodles growl. He
	shoots out an arm and grabs one, then the other.


	EXT. TREES - NIGHT

	Lestat, bending over the body of the dead youth. A
	scream pierces the night.

				WIDOW ST CLAIR
		Murder!!! Murderer!!


	EXT. LAWNS. NIGHT

	The widow on the grass, her poodles dead beside her.
	Louis is trying to quiet her.

				WIDOW ST CLAIR
		My little papillions! My
		butterflies!!! He killed them!!!

	Lestat comes from nowhere, claps a hand over her mouth
	and breaks her neck. He spits in fury at Louis.

				LESTAT
		You whining coward of a vampire who
		prowls the night killing rats and
		poodles. You could have finished us
		both!
		
	Louis throws himself on Lestat with extraordinary
	force, pummeling him towards the trees.

				LOUIS
		What have you done to me? You've
		condemned me to hell.

				LESTAT
		I don't know any hell -

	Louis hurls him against tree after tree with a strength
	he never knew he had.

				LOUIS
		You want to see me kill? Watch me
		kill you then -

	He drags him to the ground an throttles him. Lestat
	looks up at him, amazed and amused at the same time.

				LESTAT
		What strength, my friend, what
		strength. I remember why I chose
		you now.

	Lestat squirms from his grip, seemingly effortlessly.

				LESTAT
		But you can't kill me, Louis. Nor I
		you.

	He ruffles Louis' hair, with wry affection.

				LESTAT
		Feed on what you want, mon cherie.
		Rats, chickens, doves, goats. I'll
		leave you to it and watch you come
		round. Just remember, life without
		me would be even more unbearable...

	He smiles. A sly, pleasurable secret secret smile.


	EXT. POINTE DU LAC - NIGHT

	Their carriage draws up to the mansion as the first
	fingers of light spread across the sky.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Being a vampire to him meant
		revenge. Revenge against life-
		itself. Every time he took a life
		it was revenge. and the slaves with
		a wisdom that was denied their
		masters, began to notice...


	INT. SLAVE-HUT - NIGHT

	In a tiny cabin, a slave family. Kids sleeping on the
	floor, in cribs and cots. The parents sleep on the bed,
	young, beautiful, naked. Beside them is Lestat, who is
	drinking the husband's blood, his hand playing across
	the breast of the wife as he does so. She murmurs in
	her sleep.

				WIFE
		Yes... please...

	She grabs his fingers and kisses them, thinking him to
	be her husband. Lestat gently disengages himself and
	leaves.


	EXT. SLAVE-HUT - NIGHT

	The woman's scream pierces the sky, as Lestat walks
	into the night.


	EXT. CHICKEN-COOP - NIGHT

	Every chicken is dead, bloodies necks hanging down from
	the cribs. Louis emerges from the entrance, blood on
	his lips. He hears the scream.


	EXT. SLAVE QUARTER - NIGHT

	The sound of drumming is heard, African, primal. The
	woman runs through the quarters, screaming grief.
	Others gather at doorways, restrain and console her.


	EXT. DOVE-COTE - DAY

	A beautiful, elaborate eighteenth century dove-cote.
	Every dove inside is dead, pierced at the neck. A black
	hand throws in a flaming torch and it bursts into
	flame.


	INT. CABIN - NIGHT

	A doll, made in the image of Lestat, is pierced with
	needles.


	EXT. SWAMP BY FIELDS - DAY

	Bodies of slaves floating in the swamp, with the bodies
	of goats. Slaves at the edge throw ropes around the
	bodies, pull them towards the shore. The drumming grows
	louder.


	EXT. SLAVE-QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Louis walking through. The slaves hush as he
	approaches, gather in doorways and whisper. He turns
	and looks at them, sorrowfully. He looks truly like a
	ghost. Their eyes turn away when they meet his. He
	walks on.


	INT. DINING ROOM IN MANSION - NIGHT

	Lestat and Louis sit at the table, the untouched food
	between them.

				LESTAT
		Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a
		vampire has to be clever for many
		reasons. Here all one needs is a
		pair of fangs.

				LOUIS
		Paris? You came from Paris?

				LESTAT
		As did the one who made me.

				LOUIS
		Tell me about him. You must have
		learnt something from him! It had
		to happen for you as it did for me!

				LESTAT
		I learnt absolutely nothing. I
		wasn't give a choice, remember?

				LOUIS
		But you must know something about
		the meaning of it all, you must
		know where we come from, why we...

	Lestat spits out in anger.

				LESTAT
		Why? Why should I know these
		things? Do you know them?

	The drumming grows outside.

				LESTAT
			(gripping his temples)
		That noise! It's driving me mad!
		We've been in the country for
		weeks, with nothing but that
		noise!!!

				LOUIS
		They know about us. They see us
		dine on empty plates and drink from
		empty glasses.

				LESTAT
		Come the New Orleans then. There's
		an opera on tonight. A real french
		opera! We can dine in splendor!

				LOUIS
		I respect life, don't you see? For
		each and every human life I have
		respect.

				LESTAT
		Respect me a little then. I'm the
		only life you know.

	Louis stares. Lestat turns childishly, petulantly.

				LESTAT
		You'll soon run out of chickens,
		Louis...

	He walks out, humming a French aria. Louis stares at
	his plate.


	EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

	The slaves, gathered on mass around fires. Frenzied
	drumming, dancing. Lestat rides through, scattering the
	flames. The drumming stops. The slaves look towards the
	house. Slowly, they begin to move towards it.


	INT. POINTE DU LAC DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	Louis, sitting in despair by the table. Yvette, the
	slave girl enters.

				YVETTE
		Michi Louis? You don't want any
		supper?

	Louis laughs harshly.

				LOUIS
		No, ma cher. I need no supper. Is
		all well at Pointe Du Lac tonight?

	Yvette draws closer. Light reveals her beauty.

				YVETTE
		We worry about you master. When do
		you ride about the fields? How long
		since you've been to the slave
		quarters? Everywhere there is
		death. Animals, men. Are you our
		master still at all?

	Louis watches her sadly. He's getting hungry. Her
	throat is long and slender, her breasts are gorgeous.

				LOUIS
			(dazed)
		Leave me alone now, Yvette.

				YVETTE
		I will not go unless you listen to
		me. Send away this new friend of
		yours. The slaves are frightened of
		him. They are frightened of you.

	She comes closer, and he can hear her beating heart.
	She touches his hair. He takes her hand and brings it
	to his lips.

				LOUIS
		I am frightened of myself, Yvette.

	He kisses her wrist. She suddenly gasps, sharply,
	withdraws her hand. She sees her wrist is red with
	blood. She sees the blood on his lips. She screams.

	Louis stands.

				LOUIS
		Hush, Yvette -

	She screams even louder. Louis clamps his hand over her
	mouth. Her hand grips the table-cloth, pulls, bringing
	the empty glasses and crockery to the floor.

	In horror, Louis realizes he has broken her neck. He
	brings her cut wrist to his lips, then drops it,
	revolted. He carries her body outside, grief-stricken.

	The drumming grows louder.


	EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

	Fires burning in the distance, round the slave-cabins.
	The slaves are gathered at the foot of the mansion
	steps. They see Louis come out, holding the body of
	Yvette. He is deranged with grief.

				LOUIS
		This place is cursed. Damned, do
		you hear me? And your master is the
		devil.

	He places the body of Yvette in a rocking chair on the
	veranda.

				LOUIS
		Get out while you can. You're free
		men.

	They don't move. They stare at him blankly.

				LOUIS
		Unlike me, you are no free men...

	He turns behind him, and looks at the mansion, all
	candelabra and chandeliers lighted, all windows open.

				LOUIS
		Do I have to convince you?

	He rushed up the stairs, snatches up the candelabra and
	sets fire to the drapes. He goes from window to window,
	lighting drapes, lace curtains, everything.


	SLAVES POV - MASTER

	Setting fire to the house.

	They rush up the stairs with shouts of "STOP HIM, HE'S
	MAD". A wall of flame gushes out from the interior,
	blocking their way.


	INT. BURNING MANSION - NIGHT

	Louis, wandering from room to room of the burning
	mansion. he sees paintings of his wife consumed by the
	flames. He is weakening with the fumes, the heat. We
	can see this in his face, the texture of his skin.

	Suddenly a large french window cascades inwards and
	Lestat stands there, whip in hand. Behind him we can
	see the morning sky.

				LESTAT
		You fool, what have you done?

				LOUIS
		What you wouldn't do. It's almost
		sunrise. It will be the sun or the
		fire. You said they can kill me.
		The sun or the fire!

	Louis stands there, weakened, then collapses onto the
	floor. Lestat darts forward and catches him before he
	drops. He runs out the shattered window, carrying him
	on his shoulder.


	EXT. LARGE GRAVEYARD - DAWN

	With many crypts. Louis, unconscious, carried over
	Lestat's shoulder.


	INT. CRYPT

	Darkness. Louis lying on the floor of a large crypt. He
	slowly comes to.

				LOUIS
		Where are we?

				LESTAT
		Where do you think, my idiot
		friend? We're in a nice filthy
		cemetery. Does this make you happy?
		Is this fitting and proper enough?

	Louis laughs softly.

				LOUIS
		We belong in hell.

				LESTAT
		And what if there is no hell, or
		they don't want us there? Ever
		think of that?


	INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

	The vampire sits in silence, as if tired by his story.
	Malloy speaks, hesitantly.

				MALLOY
		You loved Yvette...

				LOUIS
		Can a vampire feel love?

				MALLOY
		You loved your wife, surely.

				LOUIS
		I was human then. Might as well ask
		can an angel feel love. Both are
		blesses or cursed with a certain...
		detachment. Though whether angels
		take as long to learn it as I, I
		will never know.

	He looks directly at Malloy, shocking him with his
	gaze.

				LOUIS
		Yes, I loved Yvette. As I loved
		Pointe Du Lac. And as with each
		thing I loved, I destroyed it.


	EXT. NEW ORLEANS - EVENING

	From the sea, at evening, shrouded in mist.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Lestat I did not love. And he
		survived.


	INT. INN - EVENING

	A lavish little supper chamber with coffered bed, fancy
	French furniture. Open to rooftops of colonial city.
	Louis sits by an open window looking out over the city.
	Behind, we can hear the laughter of Lestat and tow
	female voices. Louis turns and sees -

	Lestat, in the main chamber with two drugged or drunked
	whores. One runs her finger down his chest. The other
	seems out of it.

				WHORE #1
		You're skin's icy.

				LESTAT
		Not always...

	He presses his thumb on her neck and holds her tight,
	sinking his teeth into her neck. After a time she falls
	to the bed, dead. he turns to the other.

				LESTAT
		Your friend has no head for wine.

				WHORE
		She's stupid. I can warm that cold
		skin of yours better than she can.

				LESTAT
		Do you think so?

	He rubs her breast.

				WHORE
		Why you're warm now.

				LESTAT
		Ah, but the price is pretty high.
		Your sweet friend - I exhausted
		her.

	He bites her in turn, drinks her blood. She does into
	the swoon.

	Louis looks on in disgust. He stands.

				LOUIS
		I'm leaving you. I can't stand this
		any longer.

	Lestat pulls away from the whore.

				LESTAT
		What, no flowery speeches? About
		what a monster I am? What a vulgar
		fiend?

				LOUIS
		I'm not interested in you. You
		disgust me. I'm interested in my
		own nature and know I can't trust
		you to tell me the truth about me.

				LESTAT
		What do you imagine you are Louis?

				LOUIS
		I don't pretend to know.

				LESTAT
		Don't you understand, Louis, that
		you alone of all creatures can see
		death with impunity... you alone
		under the rising moon can strike
		like the hand of God.

	The girl moans.

				LOUIS
		Lestat, she's alive!!!

				LESTAT
		Vampires are killers. Predators,
		who's all seeing eyes were meant to
		give them detachment.

	The girl moans again, open her eyes.

				LOUIS
		The girl, Lestat -

				LESTAT
		I know. Let her alone.

	He slashes her wrist with his teeth, and lets the blood
	drip into a glass.

				LESTAT
		You think you can be human. You
		think you can go back. But you
		can't. You live off the blood of
		rats now Louis. How human is that?

	The girls moans again. Lestat drinks that glass.

				LESTAT
		Lie still, love...

	The girl begins to scream. Lestat picks her up.

				LESTAT
		You're tired love, you want to
		sleep.

	He walks to his coffin, puts her inside and sits on the
	lid. We hear muffled screaming and banging from inside.

				LOUIS
		Why do you do this Lestat?

				LESTAT
		I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take
		you aesthete's taste to purer
		things. Kill them swiftly if you
		will, but do it! For now doubt, you
		are a killer Louis. Ah!

	He stands up. The girl pushes the lid off, hysterical.
	She looks at Louis.

				GIRL
		It's a coffin, a coffin! Get me
		out!

				LESTAT
		Of course it's a coffin. You're
		dead, love.

	Louis screams at Lestat

				LOUIS
		Lestat - finish this -

				LESTAT
		You finish her - if you feel so
		much -

	The girl grabs Louis and pleads.

				GIRL
		You won't let me die, will you?
		You'll save me?

				LESTAT
		But it's too late, love. Look at
		your wrist, you breast.

	He picks her up again. He turns to Louis laughing.

				LESTAT
		Unless I make her one of us...

				LOUIS
		NO!!!

				LESTAT
		THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!

	The girl screams. Louis puts his hands to his ears.
	Then Lestat, in a fit of pique puts his teeth to her
	neck. She dies at last.

	A terrible silence descends. Lestat looks at Louis.

				LOUIS
		My God... to think you... are all I
		have to learn from...

				LESTAT
		In the old world, they called it
		the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it
		to you.

	Louis leaves without a word.


	EXT. DANK NEW ORLEANS BACK STREETS - NIGHT

	A rat scurried down a gutter, then another and another.
	Louis' hand grabs the rat. We see him from behind,
	walking down the street, gripping one, then another.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Am I damned? Am I from the devil?
		Is my very nature that of a devil?
		And all the while, as these dreaded
		questions caused me to neglect my
		thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my
		veins were threads of pain in my
		flesh, my temples throbbed.

	A smaller side street, in which every house is marked
	with an X. The street is crawling with rats, and Louis
	is following them. A man passes with a lantern.

				MAN
		Don't go that way Monsieur. It's
		the plague. Go back the way you
		came.

	Louis smiles bitterly at these words, repeating them to
	himself.

				LOUIS
		The way I came...

	He walks on, following the rats.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		... and finally, when I could stand
		it no longer, I stood in an empty
		desolate street and heard the sound
		of a child crying.

	A house, the door slightly open, marked with an X. The
	sound of a child crying inside. Louis walks towards it.


	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	A little girl, pulling at a figure in a rocking chair.

				CLAUDIA
		Mama, please wake up. Mama, I'm
		frightened, please wake up.

	As Louis enters, he sees the woman is dead. Her eyes
	are being eaten away by rats.

	Louis gasps in horror. Claudia turns. She is a radiant
	doll or angel as she stretches out her hand to Louis.

				CLAUDIA
		Monsieur, please help us. Papa's
		waiting for us at the ship. Please
		wake mama, Monsieur.

	She runs to him. Instinctively, he gathers her in his
	arms. He looks down pitying on her beautiful face.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		And if I am damned, why do I fell
		such pity for her gaunt face? Why
		do I wish to warm her tiny arms?
		Comfort her beating heart?

	She snuggles into him, suddenly utterly secure. She
	tugs at his hair, brings his head down towards her. And
	we see Louis shiver, as his lips go to her neck.

	Her breathing becomes calm as she goes into the swoon.
	Gradually another sound replaces it.

	LESTAT'S LAUGHTER, GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER.

	Suddenly Louis backs away, caught red-handed, the child
	in his arms. He sees Lestat slapping his knee and
	laughing in the doorway.

				LESTAT
		Ah, my philosopher, my martyr.
		"Never take a human life". Well you
		must admit it is funny. Or is it
		merely touching? I'm not sure.

	Louis stares at the unconscious Claudia in horror, then
	lets her slip gently into a chair. Shamefully he wipes
	his mouth, sees the tiny wounds on her throat.

	Lestat snatches up the dead mother from the chair and
	begins to dance with her in great circles, humming and
	talking. Her head falls back. Black water flows from
	her mouth.

				LESTAT
		Let's make some party of it, shall
		we? Maybe there's some life in the
		old lady yet?

	Louis flees into the street.

				LESTAT
		Come back, Louis, you are what you
		are. The plague would have got her
		within hours anyway. Merciful Death
		how you love your precious guilt.


	EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

	Louis running through an assortment of streets. All the
	night life of New Orleans flows by him.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		For years I had not savored a
		human. And when I had Lestat's
		words made sense to me. I knew
		peace only when I killed and when I
		heard her heart in that terrible
		rhythm I knew again what peace
		could be. Yet even then I could not
		contenance it...


	EXT. WATERFRONT - DAWN

	Fingers of light in the sky. Louis, pale and shivering,
	walks splashing through the water. He comes to a huge
	sewer-pipe, crowded with rats. He crawls inside.


	EXT. WATERFRONT - SOME EVENINGS LATER

	The same sewer-pipe. Now the bodies of dead rats lie
	all around. A pair of fine leather boots splash through
	the water - Lestat's.


	INT. SEWER-PIPE - EVENING

	Louis huddled there, so pale and shivering he seems
	close to death. Lestat comes through.

				LESTAT
		All I need to find you Louis is
		follow the corpses of rats.

	He bends down to him, surprisingly gently and puts his
	own coat around him.

				LESTAT
		Pain is terrible for you. You feel
		it like no other creature because
		you are a vampire. You don't want
		it to go on.

				LOUIS
		No...

	They emerge from the sewer and walk along the
	waterfront.

				LESTAT
		Do what it is in your nature to do.
		And you will feel as you felt with
		that child in your arms.

				LOUIS
		Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt
		an end to the craving.

				LESTAT
		That and more.

	He puts his arm around Louis, to stop his shivering.

				LESTAT
		Evil is a point of view. God kills,
		indiscriminately, and so shall we.
		For no creatures under God are as
		we are, none so like him as
		ourselves.

				LOUIS
		Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?

				LESTAT
		Ah, but we have even more in common
		with our creator. come, I am like a
		mother tonight. I want a child.

	Louis is baffled. He follows.


	INT. INN - SUPPER ROOM

	Lestat enters.

				LESTAT
		She's here, your wounded one.

				LOUIS
		What are you saying?

				LESTAT
		You need company, Louis. More
		congenial than mine...

	Lestat holds up a candle and walks towards a large four-
	poster bed. Claudia lies there, angelic, under the
	coverlet, two marks on her neck.

				LOUIS
		Lestat!

				LESTAT
		You remember how you wanted her,
		the taste of her -

				LOUIS
		I didn't want to kill her.

				LESTAT
		Don't worry, Louis, you're
		conscience is clear. You left her
		alive.

	Lestat shakes her gently.

				LESTAT
		Claudia, Claudia, listen to me.
		You're ill, my precious and I'm
		going to give you what you need to
		get well.

				LOUIS
		Lestat, what do you mean?

	Louis runs at him, but Lestat brushes him aside
	effortlessly, so he falls to the floor. Lestat bites
	his wrist and presses the bleeding wound to the child's
	mouth... He winces in pain.

				LESTAT
		That's it dear. More. You must
		drink it to get well.

	Claudia sucks on the wound, reviving, making little
	noises like a person waking from sleep.

	Louis rises to his feet as Claudia clutches Lestat's
	arm, sucking the blood fiercely. Lestat moans.

				LESTAT
		Stop, that's enough. No more.

	He pulls her loose and she growls and stares at him
	with big clear astonished eyes.

				CLAUDIA
		I want more.

				LOUIS
		What have you done?

	Lestat puts her down on the bed and sits beside her,
	holding his wrist, obviously in pain.

				CLAUDIA
		More.

				LESTAT
		Yes, cherie, of course you want
		more. And I'll show you how to get
		it. You drink from morals, my
		beauty, but from me? Never again.

	Still suffering, Lestat pulls the bell-rope.


	CLOSE ON CLAUDIA

	Being transformed. Becoming white yet robust, bright-
	eyed yet crazed. She shakes her beautiful curls and the
	dust falls from them. They are shining in the
	candlelight.

	Louis cannot stop looking at her. He does not notices
	as -

	The MAID enters.

				MAID
		Ah, quelle Belle enfant!

	The maid comes near the bed, kneels in front of
	Claudia. Lestat lays his hand on the maid's throat and
	Claudia watches keenly.

				LESTAT
		Gently, cherie. They are so
		innocent. They must not be made to
		suffer.

	Claudia lunges for the throbbing vein in the neck,
	locking on to the flowing blood.

	The Maid is transfixed.

	Close on Louis, his anguish, his fascinated horror.

				LOUIS
		You are the devil! You are the
		instrument of Satan!

				LESTAT
		That's enough, cherie. Stop before
		the heart stops.

	He lets the dead maid onto the floor. Claudia looks at
	the corpse.

				CLAUDIA
		I want some more.

				LESTAT
		It's bet in the beginning, lest the
		death takes you down with it. yes,
		that's it. My child. My beloved
		child.

	Lestat and Claudia sit on the Louis XVI settee. Claudia
	is a vision, a doll made out of pearl. Animated, voice
	crisp.

				CLAUDIA
		Where is Mamma?

	The words echo in Louis' head, as he puts his hands to
	his ears.

				LESTAT
		Mamma's gone to Heaven, cherie,
		like that sweet lady over there.
		They all go to Heaven. And you did
		very well, cherie. Not a drop
		spilt. Very good! You're going to
		be our child now.

	Lestat takes out his comb and begins to comb her hair.

				LESTAT
		Your mama's left you with us. She
		wants you to be happy.

				LOUIS
			(whispers)
		You are the devil! You are the
		instrument of Satan!

				LESTAT
		Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our
		little daughter?

				CLAUDIA
		I'm not your daughter.

				LESTAT
		Yes you are, my dearest. You are
		mine and Louis' daughter. You see
		Louis was going to leave us. He was
		going to go away. But now he's not.
		He's going to stay and make you
		happy.

	Claudia runs over to him. She smiles at him.

				CLAUDIA
		Lou...eee...

	Louis is conflicted. He cannot leave her. He touches
	her cheeks, her hair. Same as his. Vampire skin and
	hair. He draws in his breath, shocked by her beauty,
	then he embraces her as a father might a daughter. He
	looks over her shoulder to Lestat.

				LOUIS
		You fiend. You monster.

	Lestat smiles

				LESTAT
		One happy family.


	INT. ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO

	Malloy is open mouthed.

				MALLOY
		A child vampire!

	He sees the tape has run out. He rapidly and clumsily
	sticks in another.

				LOUIS
		Shall we go on?

				MALLOY
		He did it to make you stay with
		him!

				LOUIS
		Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I
		would love her more than the waking
		world. But there was more to it
		than that. Perhaps in the end he
		did it - to show me that he could.
		For he lavished affection on her,
		there was no doubt about that. Life
		was very different with madame
		Claudia, as you can imagine...


	EXT. NEW SPANISH TOWNHOUSE - (RUE ROYALE, NEW ORLEANS)

	Two husky movers bring in furniture through the back
	courtyard, past the fountain and the banana trees, up
	the back stairs and into -


	INT. FLAT

	Striped wallpaper gives way to flowers in the bedrooms.
	Huge four-poster beds in the bedrooms, and large
	chests, as big as coffins standing against the wall.
	Everywhere there are candles and pretty Louis XVI
	furniture. Lestat gives instructions to the movers.


	WE MOVE INTO A DIMLY LIT PARLOUR

	We see Claudia draped in lace standing on a petit point
	chair as a DRESSMAKER measure out a garment.

	Louis can be seen, in an inner room.

				DRESSMAKER
		Monsieur, I need more light. I
		shall go slind if you do not bring
		me a lamp, or let me fit this child
		during the day. Ouch!

	She has pricked her hand. A spot of blood appears on
	her finger Claudia takes her hand.

				CLAUDIA
		Let me kiss it better...

	Claudia brings the hand to her lips. The dressmaker
	abruptly pulls her finger away, in pain again.

	CLOSEUP - her finger, two holes showing.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		A little child she was, but also a
		fierce killer, now capable of the
		ruthless pursuit of blood with all
		a child's demanding.

	Lestat walks through - sees the dressmaker lying dead
	at Claudia's feet, Claudia still on the chair in the
	half-finished dress.

				LESTAT
		Claudia, Claudia, will you never
		learn? Who will we get now to
		finish your dress? A little
		practicality, cherie...


	INT. LOUIS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		She would sleep in my coffin,
		daily, curl her child's fingers
		round my hair as she dreamt of I
		know not what...
		
	Claudia and Louis, sleeping in a coffin together,
	Claudia's fingers curling his hair.


	INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM

	Claudia playing with dolls, each as perfect and
	beautifully dressed as she is.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Mute and beautiful, she played with
		dolls, dressing them and undressing
		them by the hour.


	INT. PARLOUR - NIGHT

	Claudia tinkling with her child's hands on the piano,
	picking out a hesitant tune.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Mute and beautiful, she killed. And
		to watch her kill was chilling.


	EXT. SQUARE - NIGHT

	The tinkling of Claudia's piano is heard, over -

	A well-dressed lady, walking through a square lit by
	gaslight. The lady hears a child's sobbing and stops,
	turns.


	POV

	Claudia, the picture of lost innocence, sitting on a
	bench and crying.

				WOMAN
		Why are you crying, child?

	The woman, all solicitude, goes to Claudia.

				WOMAN
		Are you lost, my love?

				CLAUDIA
		Mama...

				WOMAN
		Hush now, don't cry, We'll find
		her...

				CLAUDIA
		Mama...

	The woman takes Claudia in her arms. Claudia nestles
	her head in her shoulder, her teeth near her neck.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		They found death fast in those
		days, before she learnt to play
		with the, to delay the moment till
		she had taken what she wanted...


	INT. PARLOUR - NIGHT

	A stern, stiff PIANO-TEACHER (male) beating time with a
	ruler as Claudia picks out scales on the piano. He raps
	her on the knuckles.

				PIANO-TEACHER
		The thumb girl! Mind the thumb!

	Claudia glares at him, then returns to playing,
	improving rapidly.


	INT. DOLL-SHOP - NIGHT

	Piano music over. Mozart, now well played.

	Claudia staring at a glass case, inside of which are an
	array of eighteenth century dolls. An old DOLLMAKER
	looks down on her.

				DOLLMAKER
		They are expensive, my dear. Maybe
		too expensive for a young girl like
		you...


	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Claudia walking along, clutching the doll.


	INT. DOLL-SHOP - NIGHT

	The dollmaker lying dead, two puncture marks in his
	throat, his dolls scattered all around him.


	EXT. UNDERTAKER'S - NIGHT

	Claudia and Louis looking through the window at a
	display of coffins. Claudia point at the smallest one.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		She grew, yet stayed the same. She
		wanted a bed of her own, yet would
		climb back into mine.


	INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The child's coffin on the floor. The lid lifts. Claudia
	emerges, yawning, wanders through the flat into -


	LOUIS' BEDROOM

	Where his coffin sits. She slides the lid off, and
	curls in beside him.


	INT. PARLOUR - NIGHT

	Claudia playing the piano, now with remarkable
	dexterity. The piano-teacher sits mute beside her. As
	she plays, he topples over and falls to the ground. We
	see the puncture-marks in his neck. Lestat, hearing the
	noise, comes in.

				LESTAT
		Claudia, Claudia! Didn't I tell
		you, never in the house!

	Claudia smiles to herself, keeps playing.


	INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	CANARIES sing in a cage, above a child's coffin.

	Claudia is writing at a secretaire. She is writing in a
	diary with a quill pen in an adult hand. She murmurs
	the date as she writes.

				CLAUDIA
		September 21st, one hour after
		sunset. The sky is still violet,
		the way Louis loves and as always
		Lestat was gone when we rose.

	She looks up and sees Louis in the doorway, watching
	her.

				LOUIS
		How did you learn to write,
		Claudia?

				CLAUDIA
		The way I learn everything. By
		watching you.

	She closes the diary.

				CLAUDIA
		But you never let me see you kill,
		Louis.

				LOUIS
		Lestat taught you all you need to
		know about that.

				CLAUDIA
		Infant death, he calls me. Sweet
		daughter death. You know what he
		calls you? Merciful death.

				LOUIS
		He jests.

				CLAUDIA
		Why does he call you that?

				LOUIS
		Hush, Claudia don't talk about such
		things. Show me your book.

	She opens it. Inside there is a beautiful pen and ink
	portrait of Louis.

				LOUIS
		Claudia! You did that?

				CLAUDIA
		Sit still. It's not finished -

	She begins to fill in the sketch.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Time can pass fast for mortals when
		they're happy. With us it was the
		same.


	EXT. RUE ROYALE - NIGHT (1800'S)

	Street lamps are oil at this period. Houses are now
	tall two-story Spanish style. Streets are flagstone.
	Passing carriages are black.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		It was a very different life. And a
		new century was beginning. what had
		once been a small godforsaken
		French colony was growing into a
		great port, giving us an endless
		train of magnificent strangers...

	Claudia, Louis and Lestat, dressed in the same clothes
	walking through a raucous carnival with sideshows.
	Crowd milling around, sailors, whores, children,
	thieves, freed slaves, Indians. They pass a Wild West
	display, jugglers, fire-eaters, three-card
	tricksters...

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		All human life was here, for the
		taking. And we took, all three of
		us, in our different ways...

	They come to a raised platform where a troupe of
	perfectly-formed midgets do a burlesque show.

	Claudia stops. She stares, at these small, perfect
	creatures like herself, intrigued and troubled.

	Louis and Lestat walk on, not noticing as -


	CLAUDIA

	Circles the troupe. She comes to a small tent, behind
	it. At the entrance stands a midget youth.

				YOUTH
		You want to come inside, lovely?

	Claudia walks up to him.

				YOUTH
		Ever been kissed?

	Claudia shakes her head. He kisses her. Claudia allow
	her to be kissed, then bites his tongue. he youth
	struggles, as Claudia holds him and drains him. She
	lets him go as Louis appears behind her.

				CLAUDIA
		She's like me, Louis. Small and yet
		not small at all. Like me.

	Louis hurriedly draws her away.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I watched her grow yet stay the
		same, her doll-like face possessed
		of adult eyes, eerie, powerful,
		seductive...


	INT. FLAT - NIGHT

	Claudia playing the piano, now like a demonic Liszt.
	Louis writing.

	Lestat appears in the doorway. He has a big box in his
	arms.

				CLAUDIA
		Another doll? I have ten, you
		realize.

	FOCUS ON early 19th Century French dolls - wood, glass,
	wax, bisque - all around the bedroom, on chairs, on the
	bed. Some newish, some tattered old.

				LESTAT
		Well, I thought you could use
		another.

	He hands her the box. It is a fine Parisian Jumeau
	doll. She likes it and stokes its face.

				CLAUDIA
		Why always on this night?

				LESTAT
		What night? What do you mean?

				CLAUDIA
		You always give me the doll on the
		same night of the year.

				LESTAT
		I didn't realize.

				CLAUDIA
		Is this my birthday?

	He examines the other dolls.

				LESTAT
		Some of these are so old and
		tattered. You should throw them
		away.

				CLAUDIA
		I have. Or there would be twice as
		many.

				LESTAT
		But you're the fairest by far.

				CLAUDIA
		You dress me like a doll. You make
		my hair like a doll. Why?

	Lestat doesn't answer. Claudia stands up quickly, and
	strides out into the -


	PARLOUR

	Where Louis is reading by the window. She walks to a
	mirrored cabinet, takes out a scissors and begins
	cutting her hair.

				CLAUDIA
		You want me to be a doll forever?

				LOUIS
		Claudia - don't -

				CLAUDIA
		Why not?

	She continues cutting. She sees Lestat emerge from her
	bedroom in the mirror behind her then turns to him, an
	angelic little boy's face now with soft curls around
	her face.

				CLAUDIA
		Can't I change, like everybody
		else?

	She walks past him, back into her bedroom and slams the
	door.

	A beat. Louis looks from the mass of blonde hair on the
	floor to Lestat. Then a HORRID SCREAM pierces the
	silence. More screams, which become roars.


	INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM

	She stands before the dressing-table, all her long hair
	grown back over her shoulders. She holds it with both
	hands, screaming and screaming. Lestat and Louis come
	through the door.

				CLAUDIA
		Which of you did it? Which of you
		made me the way I am?

				LESTAT
		What you are? You would be
		something other than you are?

				CLAUDIA
		And if I cut my hair again?

				LESTAT
		It will grow back again!

				CLAUDIA
		But it wasn't always so! I had a
		mother once! And Louis - he had a
		wife! He was mortal the same as
		she! And so was I!

				LOUIS
		Claudia -

	She turns on Lestat.

				CLAUDIA
		You made us what we are, didn't
		you?

				LESTAT
		Stop her Louis!

				CLAUDIA
		DID YOU DO IT TO ME????

	She runs at him with the scissors, scoring his face.
	The cut heals. She scores it again. It heals again. She
	stares at him in horror.

				CLAUDIA
			(whispering)
		How did you do it?

				LESTAT
		And why should I tell you? It's in
		my power.

				CLAUDIA
		Why yours alone? Tell me how it was
		done!!!!

				LESTAT
		Be glad I made you what you are!
		You'd be dead not if I hadn't.

	He storms out. Louis goes to Claudia and picks her up
	in his arms.

				LOUIS
			(tenderly)
		We're immortal. You've always known
		that.

				CLAUDIA
		Tell me why... you've got to tell
		me...

	Louis carries her outside, onto the porch. There is an
	old flower-seller going by.

				LOUIS
		You see the old woman? That will
		never happen to you. You'll never
		grow old. You will never die.

				CLAUDIA
		And it means something else too,
		doesn't it? I shall never, ever
		grow up.

	She clutches Louis desperately.

				CLAUDIA
		I hate him. But I cannot bear to
		lose you. You're the only companion
		I have, forever. You taught me
		everything I know. Please tell me
		Louis. Tell me how it came to be
		that I am this... thing...

	Louis strokes her beautiful face, her hair.

				LOUIS
		Come... I've something to show
		you...


	EXT. NEW ORLEANS STREETS - NIGHT

	Louis walking, holding Claudia as if he was about to
	lose her.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Though everything was changed,
		through the years had warped the
		contours of the streets, I found my
		way there, aware that I'd always
		known where it was and avoided it,
		not wanting to pass the doorway
		where I'd first heard Claudia cry.

	Louis back in the same street, outside the same house.
	He stands with Claudia at the window. There is a family
	inside, a picture of domestic tranquility.

				LOUIS
		I heard you crying. You were there
		in a room with your mother. You
		were hugging her for warmth, crying
		pitifully as you had been for days.
		Because your mother was dead...

	Claudia stares at him, suddenly very cold, very alert.

				LOUIS
		I opened the shutters... I came
		into the room... I felt pity for
		you. Pity, but something else.

	He can't go on. Claudia's eyes are remorseless.

				CLAUDIA
		You... fed on me?

				LOUIS
		And he found me with you. I ran,
		sickened at what I'd done. Then he
		cut his wrist and fed you from him.
		I tried to stop him, but you were a
		vampire then. And have been every
		night hereafter.

				CLAUDIA
		You both did it?

				LOUIS
		I took your life. He gave you
		another one.

	Claudia speaks through indrawn breath.

				CLAUDIA
		And here it is. And I hate you
		both.

	She runs.


	INT. ROOM SAN FRANCISCO

	Malloy and Louis.

				MALLOY
		But why did you tell her?

				LOUIS
		How could I not? She had to know.

				MALLOY
		And did you lose her? Did she go?

				LOUIS
		Where would she have gone? She was
		a child, and beautiful,
		heartbreaking merciless child. And
		I had made her that...


	EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

	Louis, walking the streets, shivering.

				LOUIS
		I walked all night. I walked as I
		walked years before when my mind
		swam with guilt at the thought of
		killing. I found myself at the
		Cathedral.

	A cathedral rising out of the mist, the doors open.

				LOUIS
		I thought of all the things I had
		done and couldn't undo. And I
		longed for one second's peace...

	Louis walks towards the doors, inside.


	INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

	Louis enters. The dim lights of candles. A sacristan
	tending the altar, an old woman praying - otherwise
	empty.

				LOUIS
		I had no fear. If anything I longed
		for something to happen, for the
		stones to tremble as I entered the
		foyer.

	Louis walking down the nave of the church. He stops by
	the alter.

				LOUIS
		I almost genuflected from old
		habit. I almost prayed.

	Louis sits in a pew.

				LOUIS
		And then it struck me.


	LOUIS' POV

	The cross, the statues, the tabernacle.

				LOUIS
		What if the statues gave an image
		to nothing? What if I was the
		supernatural in this cathedral? The
		only immortal under this roof. And
		I felt nothing but loneliness.
		Loneliness to the point of madness.

	Suddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder. Louis almost
	jumps. He turns and sees the face of a grey-haired
	priest.

				PRIEST
		You wish to go to confession? I was
		about to lock up the church.

	Louis stares at him, tears in his eyes.

				PRIEST
		You are troubled, aren't you? Can I
		help?

				LOUIS
		It's too late, too late -

				PREIST
		No, it's never too late. Come...

	The priest gestures to the confessional. Louis rises,
	slowly.


	INT. CONFESSIONAL

	Louis, kneeling in the darkness. The hatch slides back.

				LOUIS
		Bless me father for I have sinned
		so often and so long, I don't know
		how to change nor beg for
		forgiveness.

				PRIEST
		Son, God is infinite in his
		capacity to forgive. Tell him from
		your heart.

				LOUIS
		Murders, father, death after death.
		The woman who died two nights ago
		in Jackson Square, I killed her.
		And thousands of others before her.
		I have walked the streets of New
		Orleans like the Grim reaper. And
		fed on human life for my own. I am
		a vampire, father, and have turned
		the one I love most of all into on
		too -

	The hatch slams down. Louis rises, confused, and the
	door is flung open, the priest stands there.

				PRIEST
		Do you know the meaning of
		sacrilege?

	Louis rises. Walks out.

				LOUIS
		Then there is no mercy.

	His face comes into the light. The priest steps back,
	open-mouthed.

				LOUIS
		You talk of sacrilege. Why if God
		exists does he suffer me to exist?

	He bares his fangs. The priest runs, screaming. Gets to
	the bellrope, begins to ring the bell. Louis swoops on
	him.

				LOUIS
		Why does he suffer me to live?

	Louis takes him, lifting him from the floor, till his
	feet stop kicking.


	INT. FLAT - NIGHT

	Louis enters, silently, like a corpse. He hears a voice
	behind him.

				CLAUDIA
		Locked together in hatred -

	He turns, sees her sitting in the darkness. She is
	wearing a tiny nightgown of stitched lace and pearls,
	weirdly adult and seductive. She comes towards him.

				CLAUDIA
		But I can't hate you Louis.

	She sprays perfume over her body as she comes nearer.

				CLAUDIA
		Is this the aroma of a mortal
		child?

	She whispers.

				CLAUDIA
		Louis. Lover.

	She kisses his cheek.

				CLAUDIA
		I was mortal to you. You gave me
		your immortal kiss. You became my
		mother and my father. And so I'm
		yours. Forever.

	She takes his face in her hands.

				CLAUDIA
		But now's the time to end it,
		Louis. Now's the time to leave him.

				LOUIS
		He'll never let us go.

	Claudia smiles.

				CLAUDIA
		Oh... really?


	EXT. DOCKLANDS - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

	A sailing ship, by the docks. Louis and Claudia talking
	to a shipping-clerk.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		So we made plans. She was convinced
		there were others of our kind in
		Europe, that they would have the
		answers Lestat couldn't provide.
		Lestat whom she now hated, who she
		thought she could be free of. I
		doubted, but then she had a
		surprise in store...


	INT. FLAT - NIGHT

	Lestat playing the piano. Louis reading. Claudia
	enters, wearing a cape and hat. She walks to the piano,
	sits at the end of the piano and stares at him as he
	plays.

				LESTAT
		What is it now? You irritate me!
		Your very presence irritates me!

				CLAUDIA
			(sweetly)
		Does it?

				LESTAT
		Yes. And I'll tell you something
		else! I've met someone who will
		make a better vampire than both of
		you.

				CLAUDIA
		Is that supposed to frighten me?

				LESTAT
		You're spoilt because you're an
		only child. You need a brother. Or
		I do. I'm weary of you both.

				CLAUDIA
		I suppose we could people the world
		with vampires, the three of us.

				LESTAT
		Not you my dear.

				CLAUDIA
		You're a liar. But you upset my
		plans.

				LESTAT
		What plans?

				CLAUDIA
		I came to make peace with you, even
		if you're the father of lies. I
		want things to be as they were.

	Louis perks up, puzzled.

				LESTAT
		Stop pestering me then!

				CLAUDIA
		Oh, Lestat. I must do more than
		that. I've brought a present for
		you.

				LESTAT
		Then I hope its a beautiful woman
		with endowments you will never
		possess.

	Claudia stares at him for a moment.

				CLAUDIA
		Better than that.

	She takes his hand and leads him into an inner room.
	Louis follows behind.

				CLAUDIA
		You haven't fed enough. I can tell
		by your color.


	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	Two beautiful youths, lying asleep on a couch, by a
	table full with a half-eaten meal. Lestat sighs.

				LESTAT
		Oh, Claudia, you've outdone
		yourself. Where did you find them?

				CLAUDIA
		Drunk on brandy wine. A thimbleful.
		I thought of you when I saw them.

				LESTAT
		We forgive each other then?

	Claudia stares at him, sitting. She nods.

	Lestat bites into the neck of one of the youths, sucks
	greedily and horribly. Claudia watches him without
	expression. He finished one, is about to take the other
	when he staggers. He looks at Claudia.

				LESTAT
		Absinthe? You gave them absinthe?

				CLAUDIA
		No. Laudanum.

	Lestat stares wildly at her, tries to move towards her,
	then slips to the floor.

				LESTAT
		Laudanum!

				CLAUDIA
		Yes. It killed them, unfortunately.
		But it keeps the blood warm.

	Lestat tries to rise.

				LESTAT
		Ah Louis, Louis, she killed them...
		and let me drink...

	Louis watches, appalled. He goes to move.

				CLAUDIA
		Don't Louis -

				LESTAT
		Louis, put me in my coffin...

				CLAUDIA
		I'll put you in your coffin.
		Forever.

	She pulls a knife out from under her shawl, walks
	rapidly to him and slashes his throat. Blood explodes
	from it.

				LOUIS
		Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!

				LESTAT
		Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift -
		help me -

	Claudia lacerates his face. Blood pours from
	everywhere. She plunges the knife in his chest. He
	falls back, fangs bared, clutching the knife. Claudia
	leaps on him then, bites deep into his neck as he dies.
	Louis screams, runs forward, pulls her away.

				LOUIS
		What have you done, Claudia -

	He drags her off Lestat, tries to pull her out of the
	room. She hisses at him.

				CLAUDIA
		Louis! Look what's happening to
		him!!

	Louis looks. The floor is a sea of blood. Lestat has
	begun to shrivel, as if he'd been a bag of blood. His
	skin is shriveling against his bones like parchment,
	his eyes are slipping back into his skull-like face.
	His lush, beautiful hair remains unchanged. But his
	clothes are virtually being emptied of the body. It is
	no more than bones, wrapped in paper and the pupils of
	the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull.

				LOUIS
		Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.

				CLAUDIA
		Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.

	She stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin
	wrapping. She is fascinated. She sees the vampiric
	blood flow all over the floor. She touches it and
	brings her finger to her lips.

				CLAUDIA
		Goodnight, sweet prince, may
		flights of devils wing you to your
		rest.

	Louis walks forward, touches the skeleton, the blonde
	hair.

				LOUIS
		He's dead, Claudia, dead.

				CLAUDIA
		The one good lesson he taught me,
		Louis. Never drink from the dead.

	She stands up, all business suddenly.

				CLAUDIA
		Help me. We must get rid of him.

	She drags the coverlet from the table, knocking the
	crockery over the dead youths, and wraps Lestat's
	skeleton in it. She takes a bunch of chrysanthemums and
	places them in his skeleton hands.

				CLAUDIA
		Should we burn him? Bury him? What
		would he have liked, Louis?

				LOUIS
		Don't mock, Claudia...

				CLAUDIA
		The swamp...


	EXT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT

	Louis whipping the horses. Claudia beside him. Lestat's
	skeleton in the back, with the bodies of the two dead
	youths.

				CLAUDIA
		In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our
		own kind. Find the one who made
		him. Learn what it means.

				LOUIS
		And suppose the one who made him
		knows nothing and the vampire who
		made him knows nothing, and it goes
		back, nothing proceeding from
		nothing, until there is nothing!
		And we must live with the knowledge
		that there is no knowledge.
		
	The carriage pulls up by a swamp. Mist everywhere.
	Overhanging creepers.

				LOUIS
		And if we find the one who made
		him? Do we tell him we destroyed
		his own creation? The vampire
		Lestat?

	Louis drags out the bodies of the boys. He slides them
	into the waters of the swamp. We see ripples in the
	water and the churning of alligators, as they attack
	the corpses. Louis takes Lestat's skeleton in his arms.
	He slides it into the waters. The alligators speed
	towards it.

				CLAUDIA
		He belongs with those reptiles,
		Louis. He deserved to die.

				LOUIS
		Then maybe so do we. Every night of
		our lives. He was my brother. My
		maker. He gave me this life,
		whatever it is.

				CLAUDIA
		I did it for us, Louis. So we could
		be free.

	He stands there, saying nothing.

				CLAUDIA
		Louis, look at me.

				LOUIS
			(bitterly)
		I can't. Go away from me.

	Claudia is shocked to her core. She steps back. Louis
	stares at the rippling waters. Gradually the movement
	of alligators stops. Then he hears a sound he hasn't
	heard in years. Soft, choking. He turns, sees Claudia
	sitting by a cypress tree, like a little girl for the
	first time in years. She is weeping copiously.

				LOUIS
		Claudia - You're crying -

	We see her face, tears of blood running down it. She is
	heartbroken, lost.

				CLAUDIA
		You never talked to me like that -
		in all these years.

				LOUIS
		And you never cried -

				CLAUDIA
		I can't bear it when you do - I
		would die rather than lose you
		Louis. I would die the way he died.

	Louis gathers her in his arms.

				LOUIS
		Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -

				CLAUDIA
		Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I
		did it for you -

	Louis walks her towards the carriage.

				LOUIS
		I love you Claudia. Always. And we
		are free now, Claudia. No Lestat.
		Just the two of us, beginning the
		great adventure of our lives.

	He lifts her into the carriage and drives off, leaving
	the silent waters of the swamp.


	INT. FLAT - NIGHT

	Sturdy mulatto workmen lifting cases and trunks out of
	the apartment. All the furniture is covered in white
	sheets. Claudia dressed in a cap and hat, is playing
	the piano by the light of one remaining oil-lamp.

	Louis comes from her room with the cage of canaries.

				LOUIS
		The birds. We forgot about the
		birds. There's nothing for it but
		to let them go.

	He opens the cage, and the canaries fly around the
	room.

	There is a knocking on the door. Claudia falters.

				CLAUDIA
		What was that?

				LOUIS
		The workmen must have a trunk -
		don't stop, cherie -

	He goes downstairs. Claudia plays a moment, then stops,
	perturbed. She goes to the window. Then sees something
	out there that makes her face go white. She screams.

				CLAUDIA
		Louis!!!


	THE STAIRWAY

	Louis walking to the door. The knocking gets louder.


	THE PARLOUR

	Claudia runs for the stairs, after Louis.


	THE HALLWAY

	Louis reaches the door. The knocking gets louder. He
	opens the door as -


	CLAUDIA

	Reaches the stairs. She screams -

				CLAUDIA
		Don't Louis -

	But Louis has opened the door. Nothing there. He looks
	back at Claudia, puzzled, then at the door again when,
	swooping into his vision comes the nightmare image of -


	LESTAT

	In filthy swamp-soaked rags, robust again, but his
	flesh shriveled, covered in scars, his eyes riddled,
	bloodshot. he roars.

				LESTAT
		WHERE IS SHE? WHERE IS THAT
		ACCURSED CHILD?

	Louis throws his body against the door, slamming it on
	Lestat's reaching hand. The hand withdraws, as Lestat
	roars. Louis bolts the door.

	Louis runs up the stairs, sweeps Claudia in his arms,
	watching appalled as the door shudders with the force
	of Lestat's body.


	IN THE PARLOUR

	Louis runs through with Claudia in his arms.

				LOUIS
		It can't be -

				CLAUDIA
		It is! Take the back stairwell -

	Suddenly Lestat crashes through the casement window,
	scattering blood everywhere, reefing himself on the
	shattered glass. He tumbles to the floor and gets
	unsteadily to his feet.

				LESTAT
		GIVE ME HER LOUIS!!

	Louis throws Claudia behind him and hurls himself on
	Lestat, who fights like a ravening animal, bits of his
	broken body coming off in the process. Then with a
	terrifying effort, Lestat hurls Louis off, goes for
	Claudia, who grabs the poker from the fireplace,
	scatters burning coals over him. He falls back, then
	comes at her again, as the drapes catch fire. Louis
	grabs the lamp.

				LOUIS
		Stay back - for the love of God...
		or I'll burn you alive...

	Lestat lunges again at Claudia.

	Louis hurls the lamp, which explodes him in flame.

	Lestat screams in agony, whirls around the room, then
	comes on Claudia again. She hurls another lamp.

	Louis throws the flaming sheets around him, wrapping
	him further in fire. Lestat falls to his knees,
	choking, hands up over his face in the smoke. The whole
	parlor is afire. Louis gathers up Claudia, smothering
	the burning house, carries her down the back stairs,
	through the carriage way and through the gathering
	crowds of mortals into the street.


	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Louis running, with Claudia in his arms. He looks back
	at the flames of the house. Sound of a ship's horn.

				CLAUDIA
		The ship is sailing without us!

				LOUIS
		Not yet. Holding her tightly, Louis
		runs.


	EXT. DECK OF SHIP - NEAR DAWN

	Louis stands at the railings in the morning mist as the
	ship moves down the river. He sees...


	CITY OF NEW ORLEANS

	With flame lighting up the sky.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Though the fire seemed to spread
		through the quartier, I stood on
		that deck until dawn, fearful he
		would come out again of the very
		river like some monster to destroy
		us both. And all the while I
		thought, Lestat, we deserve your
		vengeance. You gave me the dark
		gift. And I delivered you into the
		hands of death for the second time.


	INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO

	Louis and Malloy.

				MALLOY
		Did he die in the fire?

				LOUIS
		He was dead to us. We were free.
		That was all that mattered.


	EXT. SHIP - EVENING

	The ship, shrouded in mist.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Though the ship was blessedly free
		of rats, a strange plague
		nonetheless struck its passengers.

	A body is slipped into the sea. A priest reads last
	rites to a mourning family.


	INT. SHIPS HOLD

	Trunks and cases, creaking with the ship's movement.
	Dead rats everywhere.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Claudia and I alone seemed immune.
		We kept to ourselves, pondering the
		mystery of Lestat and the greater
		mystery of each other.
		

	EXT. SHIP - NIGHT

	Passing through the Straits of Gibralter.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		We reached the Mediterranean. I
		wanted those waters to be blue.
		They were black, nighttime waters
		and how I suffered then, straining
		to remember the color that a young
		man's senses had taken for granted,
		that my memory had let slip away
		for eternity. It was black off the
		coast of Italy, black off the coast
		of Greece, Europe itself was black.
		

	EXT. DECK - NIGHT

	Claudia, sitting with an easel and sketch-pad,
	sketching the bay of Naples. A beautifully realized
	drawing, all in shades of grey and black. Louis
	observes.

				CLAUDIA
		Louis, your quest is for darkness
		only. This sea is not your sea.
		They myths of men are not your
		myths. Their history isn't yours.

	The sketch changes to a sketch of -


	THE ACROPOLIS

	In the moonlight.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		We saw the Acropolis by moonlight,
		shades of grey and silver. And I
		longed for the brilliant white of
		those marbles in the hot sun of
		Homer...

	The sketch changes to a sketch of -


	TRANSYLVANIA

	And the traditional shapes of the vampire landscape.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		We docked at Varna and searched the
		rural countryside of the
		Carpathians, for what she liked to
		term "our kind"...


	MONTAGE OF SKETCHES

	A TRANSLYVANIAN VILLAGE, A GRAVEYARD.

	RUINED CASTLE AFTER CASTLE, LOOKING INTO THE SKIES...

				LOUIS
		The quest for these Old World
		vampires filled me with bitterness.
		We searched village after village,
		ruin after ruin and I was glad when
		always we found nothing. For what
		could the damned really have to say
		to the damned?


	INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO

	Malloy and Louis.

				MALLOY
		You found nothing?

				LOUIS
		Peasant rumors, superstitions about
		garlic, crosses, stakes in the
		hear, all that - how do you say
		again? Bull shit. But one of our
		kind? Not a whisper.

				MALLOY
		No vampires in Transylvania? No
		Count Dracula?

				LOUIS
		Fictions, my friend. The vulgar
		fictions of a demented Irishman...
		So we repaired to Paris...


	EXT. BOULEVARD FACADE OF GRAND HOTEL AND PARIS OPERA

	Crowds and gaslight everywhere. Carriages, horses,
	OPERA coming from the opera house.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I think the very name of Paris
		brought a rush of pleasure to me
		that was extraordinary. I was a
		Creole, after all and Paris was the
		mother of New Orleans, a universe
		whole and entire unto herself...


	EXT. 18TH CENTURE PALACES ALONG THE SEINE - NIGHT

	The high walls of the Louvre, dark figures walking in
	pairs through the shadowy tulieries.


	EXT. STREET - SHOP WINDOW

	Claudia, in furtrimmed muff and bonnet, peers through
	the glass at a display of dolls. Each doll in there
	seems to resemble her, with blonde hair and blue eyes.
	She peers deep into the shop and sees -

	MADELEINE, a young woman bent over a workbench painting
	a doll's face, oblivious to being watched.


	INT. OPERA STAIRCASE

	Louis and Claudia hurrying hand in hand with a crowd of
	mortals towards the sound of an ORCHESTRA TURNING
	beyond.


	INT. NOTRE DAME

	Claudia and Louis standing in the deep shadows, looking
	at the branching arches. Louis is overcome with
	sadness, Claudia is fascinated.


	INT. GALLERY

	Louis and Claudia walk among a series of mythological
	nudes by Poussin.


	INT. SALON - NIGHT

	Claudia, surrounded by discarded dresses and outfits,
	being attended by couturiers. All the clothes are tiny,
	to fit her frame, but have an adult cut and shape.

				LOUIS
		We were alive again. We were in
		love and so euphoric was I that I
		yielded to her every desire...


	INT. SUMPRUOUS HOTEL SUITE

	Full of late 19th century furniture, lots of Empire
	style, Regency, gilt, velvet and brocade.


	CLOSE ON A HUGE BLACK EBONY CHEST

	Against a wall, solemn among all the light and glitter.


	CLAUDIA

	By a large gilt mirror, in her new clothes. She is
	covered with jewelry, fixing earrings to her ears.

				CLAUDIA
		Help me, mon chere...

	Louis walks over, helps her with the earrings.

				CLAUDIA
		How do I look?

				LOUIS
		Still my beautiful child.

	Claudia laughs.

				CLAUDIA
		A beautiful child! Is that what you
		still think I am?

				LOUIS
		Yes...

	He turns away.

				CLAUDIA
		Why do you turn away? Why don't you
		look.

	She twirls, looking at herself in the mirror, then
	stops, stares at herself.

				CLAUDIA
		You want me to be your daughter
		forever, don't you?

				LOUIS
		Yes.

				CLAUDIA
		Well tell me, papa. What was it
		like making love?

	Louis is stunned. He blushes.

				CLAUDIA
		You don't remember? Or you never
		knew.

				LOUIS
		It was something hurries...and
		seldom savored... something acute
		that was quickly lost. It was the
		pale shadow of killing.

				CLAUDIA
		But how will I ever know, Louis?

	She stares at him through the mirror.

				CLAUDIA
		I'll never find them, will I? My
		own kind...


	EXT. BOULEVARD - EVENING

	Louis and Claudia walk along a boulevard like father
	and daughter. All around them are bourgeois Parisian
	families on their evening stroll. Claudia points at the
	children that pass.

				CLAUDIA
		Have I anything in common with her,
		Louis?

	She points to a beautiful French child walking by with
	her mother.

				CLAUDIA
		Or her, or her - or any of them?

				LOUIS
		Claudia, you torture yourself.

				CLAUDIA
		They are ducklings, that will grow
		into swans. Whereas I must be the
		duckling forever.

				LOUIS
		You are more beautiful than any of
		them.


	EXT. DOLL-SHOP - NIGHT

	We see Madeleine, inside, painting a doll's face. Louis
	and Claudia arrive outside.

				CLAUDIA
		All her dolls resemble me.


	POV

	Claudia's face, with the dolls in the background. The
	resemblance is uncanny.

				CLAUDIA
		Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never
		change either.

				LOUIS
		You are neither, Claudia. Now stop
		this -

	Madeleine sees Claudia from inside. She waves.

				LOUIS
		You know her?

				CLAUDIA
		Yes. Should I take her, Louis?
		Among her dolls? make a doll of her
		in turn?

				LOUIS
		Come, Claudia...

	He takes her arm. But Claudia shakes him off, and moves
	into the shop.


	EXT. LATIN QUARTER - NIGHT

	Louis walks briskly, head bowed.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		For a time we had been almost
		human, in the sensual whirl of what
		Paris had to offer. But the human
		delights of that city only served
		to remind her of the ageless child
		she had become. I felt her pain as
		I walked until I become aware that
		I was being followed.


	CLOSEUP - LOUIS' FEET

	Walking. A step echoes his.

	Louis stops. Turns, sees nothing. Then walks again. The
	echoing steps begin again.

	Louis again. Sees a shadow, flitting.

				LOUIS
		Claudia!

	Nothing. He walks again, hears the same effect. Then he
	stops. He stares at a gaslamp opposite.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		So it was when I had given up the
		search for vampires that a vampire
		found me...

	Santiago, a tall vampire, materializes under the
	gaslight. And Louis gradually realizes that this
	vampire has assumed the same attitude, posture, clothes
	and hair-style as Louis.

	Louis gives an involuntary shake of the head. Santiago
	mimics. Louis takes a step forwards. Santiago mimics.
	Louis folds his arms. Santiago mimics.

				LOUIS & STATIAGO
			(simultaneously)
		Clever.

				LOUIS
		You mean me harm?

				SANTIAGO
			(a beat later)
		You mean me harm?

	Louis calculates.

				LOUIS
		Trickster. Buffoon!

	Santiago echoes the first word, but not the second.
	Louis has broken his composure. He turns his back on
	Santiago, only to come face to face with Santiago right
	in front of him.

	Again Louis turns this back to find Santiago facing
	him.

	Louis turns, glowers, refusing to look at him.

				LOUIS
		I've searched the world for an
		immortal and this is what I find?

	Slowly he looks up. Santiago draws close, breaking the
	mirror trick and suddenly slams Louis back against the
	wall.

	Louis is furious. He regains his balance, strikes out
	at Santiago and when Santiago vanishes, to reappear
	behind him, Louis slams back his elbow into his
	midriff. Santiago staggers, amazed and then rushes at
	Louis, throwing him down.

	Louis rolls back to his feet, then to his amazement
	sees two vampires, on in front, on behind. He looks
	both ways, then sees one has vanished. He stares,
	awestruck, at this new one:

				ARMAND
		He looks like an angel.

				ARMAND
		You are all right.

	He reaches into his waistcoat, takes an engraved
	invitation out of his pocket and thrusts it at Louis.

	Louis reads it aloud, as we see:

	"THEATRE DES VAMPIRES
	By Special Invitation
	Friday, 9 p.m."

				ARMAND
		Bring the petit beauty with you. No
		one will harm you. I won't allow
		it. Remember my name. Armand.

	Armand bows and vanishes.

	Louis listens to the silence.


	EXT BOULEVARD DES CAPUCHINES - THEATRE DES VAMPIRES -
	NIGHT

	Louis formally dressed with Claudia in rich attire on
	his arm. They pass people buying tickets for the
	theatre and go inside.

				LOUIS
		Remember what I've told you.
		They'll have different powers.
		They'll read your thoughts if you
		allow it.

	They draw close to:


	HUGE POSTERS

	Reading -

	"THEATRE DES VAMPIRES PRESENTS
	THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH
	By Edgar Allen Poe"

	The posters are illustrated with cliched images of
	vampires overcoming damsels in distress.


	ANOTHER ANGLE

				CLAUDIA
		But this can't be real. This is
		nonsense.

				LOUIS
		Nonsense all right. But something
		tell me it's going to be the
		strangest nonsense we've ever seen.

	Warily, they show their invitations to the mortal
	ticket taker at the door. He glances away
	indifferently.


	INT. THEATRE BOX - NIGHT

	Claudia and Louis look at the crowd as the lights go
	down.

				CLAUDIA
		Mortals, mortals everywhere. And
		lots of drops to drink.

				LOUIS
		They are here. I know they are.
		Listen for something that doesn't
		make a sound.

	Stage: curtain rises.

	An elaborate painted set of an Italianate castle. Death
	standing before it, the traditional image of the Grim
	Reaper, complete with magnificent scythe.

				LOUIS
			(whispers)
		It's a vampire. It's the one I saw
		in Rue St Jacques.

	A version of the Poe story unfolds before them. All of
	the participants are vampires. All beautiful gleaming
	white, aged 20 or 30.

				LOUIS
		They use no paint. And the audience
		think it is paint.

				CLAUDIA
		How devilishly clever.

	A spotlight uncovers a mortal woman suddenly forced out
	upon the stage.

				CLAUDIA
		She's no vampire.

				LOUIS
		No. She's frightened. She doesn't
		know where she is.

	The audience laughs uneasily, then stops as the Mortal
	Woman comes into the footlights. She is too beautiful,
	too confused. Santiago, as Death, advances on her. She
	backs away, terrified, then sees the other vampires, in
	a phalanx, advancing from behind, in a half-circle.

				MORTAL WOMAN
		I don't want to die!

	She looks around in panic. Santiago swoons, arms over
	his breast as if he is hopelessly in love.

				SANTIAGO
		We are death!

	The Mortal Woman steps to the footlights.

				MORTAL WOMAN
		Someone help me. Please... What
		have I done?

	Louis whispers to Claudia.

				LOUIS
		This is no performance.

				CLAUDIA
		And no one knows but us...


	ON THE STAGE

				SANTIAGO
		We all die. Death is the one thing
		you share with all those here.

	Santiago gestures to the audience.


	AUDIENCE

	Rapt faces.


	ON THE STAGE

				MORTAL WOMAN
		But I'm young...

				SANTIAGO
		Death is no respecter of age. He
		can come any time, any place. Need
		I tell you what fate has in store
		for you?

				MORTAL WOMAN
		I would take my chance. Let me go!
		Please...

				SANTIAGO
		And if you take that chance and
		live, what is your fate? The
		humpbacked toothless visage of old
		age?

	Santiago approaches her and tears the drawstring out of
	her peasant blouse. It opens completely and starts to
	slip. She tries to catch it, but gently stops her
	wrists. The blouse falls, exposing her young breasts.


	LOUIS AND CLAUDIA

				LOUIS
		This is monstrous!

				CLAUDIA
		Yes, and very beautiful.


	ON THE STAGE

				SANTIAGO
		Just as this flesh is pink now, it
		will turn grey and wrinkle with
		age.

				MORTAL WOMAN
		Let me live, please. I don't care.

				SANTIAGO
		Then why should you care if you die
		now?

	She shakes her head, confused. he catches her wrists
	behind her back.


	AUDIENCE

	Is awestruck by her beauty, her suffering.


	SANTIAGO

	Draws near her cheek.

				SANTIAGO
		And suppose death had a heart to
		love and to release you? To whom
		would he turn his passion? Would
		you pick a person from the crowd
		there? A person to suffer as you
		suffer?


	AUDIENCE

	A young girl cries out in jest.

				YOUNG GIRL
		Oh, yes, take me Monsieur Vampire!
		I adore you!

	Audience roars with laughter.


	ON THE STAGE

				SANTIAGO
		You wait your turn.

	The audience laughs again.

	The Mortal Woman shakes her head in panic.

				SANTIAGO
		Well, have you a sister, a mother,
		a daughter you would send in your
		place?


	CLOSE ON CLAUDIA

	Even she is repelled by the cruelty. She shakes her
	head.


	MORTAL WOMAN

	Shakes her head. She is helpless.

				SANTIAGO
		We alone can give death meaning. Do
		you know what it means to be loved
		by death, to become our bride?

	Mortal Woman looks up on the verge of hysteria or
	fainting. But then her eyes mist over. She is being
	entranced.


	FROM HER POV

	We realize she is looking past Santiago at the divinely
	beautiful Armand, who has just stepped out of the
	wings. Armand has entranced her. He passes Santiago.
	Santiago stiffens, but yields the stage.

				ARMAND
		No pain.

				MORTAL WOMAN
		No pain?

	Armand takes her by the naked shoulders.

				ARMAND
		Your beauty is a gift to us.


	ON THE STAGE

	Armand gestures to the others who slowly, gracefully
	close in.

				ARMAND
		Who deserves such a gift?

	He pulls the drawstring from her skirt and it falls
	revealing her nakedness. But she is spellbound.

				MORTAL WOMAN
		No pain...

	Armand embraces her, drinks, her naked body stark
	against her black clothes, then he passes her to the
	other vampires one by one.


	CLOSE ON LOUIS

	Who battles desire and hunger with anger.

				LOUIS
		I've seen enough of this! I loathe
		it!

				CLAUDIA
		Be still!


	ON THE STAGE

	The naked Mortal Woman lies dead on the floor. The
	vampires seem to vanish one by one. As the curtain
	draws across, the Audience loudly applauds what they
	presume are theatrical tricks.


	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The audience, milling towards the exits. They talk in
	vacuous terms about the beauty of the show, the
	symbolism of it, the daring of it as they leave.

	Gradually Louis and Claudia are left alone in the empty
	theatre. Louis seems anxious to leave. Claudia whispers
	in his ear.

				CLAUDIA
		Patience, Louis. Patience.

	He looks around the empty theatre, more eerie now than
	when the play was on. The red curtain shifts slightly
	in a hidden breeze, a candle sputters and dies in a
	box. Then the candle flares again, and we see Armand in
	the box, looking down on them. He stares with a dreamy
	expression, saying nothing.

				LOUIS
		We've been searching for you for a
		very long time...

	His voice echoes eerily. Armand gestures for them to
	follow him.


	INT. FOOT OF STAIRWAY

	Armand leading, Louis and Claudia following. It opens
	into a -


	HUGE UNDERGROUND BALLROOM

	Walls are painted with famous copies of Durer,
	Brueghel, Goya and Bosch depictions of death. Fine
	wooden coffins line the walls. Candles burn in sconces,
	casting alternate shadows and pools of light. Armand
	walks through, gesturing Louis and Claudia to follow
	him.

	As they walk through, vampire man and women appear out
	of the shadows like wraiths, startling them, drifting
	around them, stroking them, touching Claudia as if she
	were a doll. Shrieks of preternatural laughter.

	Armand gestures to the vampires to back off.

	All obey but ESTELLE.

				ESTELLE
		Such a darling.

	She menaces Claudia, her breasts enormous, her fangs
	bared. Armand throw her a look, and she is flung
	against the wall.

	Louis stares around. The vampires faces drift towards
	him and away, always disclosing the face of Armand, who
	seems some distance away, but strangely close, staring
	at Louis with a constantly calm, hypnotic gaze. Then a
	young mortal boy comes from the shadows with a
	candelabra, which he hands to Armand.

	Armand and the boy come towards them, leading them
	along the walls, his candelabra illuminating the
	ghastly murals, his face gleaming like an angel above
	the candleflame.

				LOUIS
		Monstrous.

				ARMAND
		Yes, and very beautiful.

				LOUIS
		Your lips, they didn't move.

				ARMAND
		They did, but too fast for you to
		see them. No magic, just grace and
		speed.

	The boy is watching Louis. Armand's hand beckons and
	the boy draws up to Louis in the candlelight. He places
	his arms on Louis' shoulders. Louis glances at Armand,
	who smiles. Louis sees the puncture marks on the boy's
	neck.

				ARMAND
		He wants you...

	Louis is utterly confused. Can't resist. Drinks his
	blood.

	The boy's body presses against him, sensual, willing.
	The other vampires appear all around Louis, who
	suddenly senses it and draws away, ashamed.

	Claudia watches warily, from a distance. Armand beckons
	at her and Louis and open a door in the wall which
	reveals a stone staircase.


	INT. MEDIEVAL ROOM

	Medieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a bed in one
	corner, a blazing fire. A medieval painting of Satan,
	being banished from heaven, above the fire. Armand
	places the boy on the bed, settling him so he sleeps.

				ARMAND
		Disappointing, isn't it? To come so
		far and find so little. Jaded
		ingenues, amusing themselves with
		make- believe...

				LOUIS
		We had feared we were the only
		ones...

				ARMAND
		But how did you come into
		existence?

	He glances at Louis, then at Claudia, who averts her
	eyes.

				ARMAND
		You don't want to answer... Two
		vampires from the new world, come
		to guide us into the new era as all
		we love slowly rots and fades away.

				LOUIS
		Are you the leader of this group?

				ARMAND
		If there were a leader, I would be
		the one.

	Claudia stares at him constantly, guarded.

				LOUIS
		So you have the answers...

				ARMAND
		Ah! You have questions?

				LOUIS
		What are we?

				ARMAND
		Nothing if not vampires...

				LOUIS
		Who made us what we are?

				ARMAND
		Surely you know the one who made
		you...

				LOUIS
		But the one who made him, who made
		the one who made him, the source of
		all this evil...

	Louis looks at the picture. Armand watches him.

				ARMAND
		That is a picture, nothing more.

				LOUIS
		You mean we are not children of
		Satan?

				ARMAND
		No.

	He smiles at Louis. A smile of infinite compassion.

				ARMAND
		I understand. I saw you in the
		theatre, your suffering, your
		sympathy for that girl. I saw you
		with the boy. You die when you
		kill, you feel you deserve to die
		and you stint on nothing. But does
		that make you evil? Or, since you
		comprehend what you call goodness,
		does it not make you good?

				LOUIS
		Then there is nothing.

				ARMAND
		Perhaps...

	He passes his finger through the candle flame.

				ARMAND
		And perhaps this is the only real
		evil left...

				LOUIS
		Then God does not exist...

				ARMAND
		I have not spoken to him...

				LOUIS
		And no vampire here has discourse
		with God or the Devil?

				ARMAND
		None that I've ever known. I know
		nothing of God or the Devil, I have
		never seen a vision nor learnt a
		secret that would damn or save my
		soul. And as far as I know, after
		four hundred years I am the oldest
		living vampire in the world.

	He stares at them, his face angelic, hypnotic, young.
	His eyes hold them both in a trance.

				LOUIS
		My God... So it's as I always
		feared. Nothing, leading to
		nothing.

				ARMAND
		You fell too much. So much you make
		me feel...

	He stares from Claudia to Louis. He seems to be reading
	their souls.

				ARMAND
		The one who made you should have
		told you this. The one who left the
		old world for the new...

				LOUIS
		He knew nothing. He just didn't
		care.

				ARMAND
		Knew? You mean he is...

	Claudia appears suddenly to Louis' shoulder,
	interrupting.

				CLAUDIA
		Come, beloved. It's time we were on
		our way. I'm hungry and the city
		waits.

	She stares hard at Armand. Armand looks from her to
	Louis.

				ARMAND
		So soon to go?

	He seems genuinely regretful. But Claudia pulls Louis
	out.


	INT. DARKENED CORRIDORS AND THEATRE - NIGHT

	Louis and Claudia feel their way through darkened
	corridors, trying to find their way out.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		The place was dark as we left, a
		darkness that confounded even
		Claudia. And as we blundered
		through it, again came the thought:
		I have wronged Lestat, I have hated
		him for the wrong reasons.

	Suddenly a light comes on. They see they are in the
	empty theatre. Santiago stands on the stage, under a
	candle.

				SANTIAGO
		How did you wrong him?

	Louis is stunned.

				LOUIS
		You read my thoughts?

				SANTIAGO
		You said a name -

				LOUIS
		A name I don't want to say again.

				SANTIAGO
		I seemed to recognize it...

	Other vampires appear behind him.

				SANTIAGO
		There is but one crime among us
		vampires here.

	He looks at Claudia.

				SANTIAGO
		You should know, who are so
		secretive about the vampire who
		made you.

	Claudia laughs.

				CLAUDIA
		Boredom!

				SANTIAGO
		It is the crime that means death to
		any vampire. To kill your own kind!

				CLAUDIA
		Aaaah! I was so afraid it was to be
		born like Venus out of the foam, as
		we were! Come Louis, let's go!


	EXT. HOTEL SAINT GABRIEL - NIGHT

	Claudia and Louis enter the Lobby.

				CLAUDIA
		I loathe them! I can't stand the
		sight of them! Stupid bourgeois
		Parisians, all dressed in black
		like some private club! I've
		searched for them the world over
		and I despise them!

				LOUIS
		What danger?

				CLAUDIA
		I can feel it from them! They want
		to know who made us, what became of
		him. They have their rules, their
		idiotic rules!

	They come to their room, enter.


	INT. HOTEL ROOMS - NIGHT

	Louis closes the door behind him. Claudia paces.

				LOUIS
		Do you think I would let them harm
		you?

				CLAUDIA
		No, you would not, Louis. Danger
		hold you to me.

				LOUIS
		Love holds you to me. And we are in
		danger, not you.

				CLAUDIA
		Love?

	She smiles at him. A strange, sad, adult smile.

				CLAUDIA
		You would leave me for Armand if he
		beckoned you.

				LOUIS
		Never.

				CLAUDIA
		He wants you as you want him. He's
		been waiting for you. He wants you
		for a companion. He bides his time
		that place. he finds them as dull
		and lifeless as we do.

				LOUIS
		That's not so.

				CLAUDIA
		Do you know what his soul said to
		me without saying a word? When he
		put me in that trance...

				LOUIS
		So you felt it too!

				CLAUDIA
		Let him go, he said. Let him go.

	She touches his face.

				CLAUDIA
		Is that what I should do Louis? Let
		you go? My father? My lover? My
		Louis, who made me?

	There are tears in her eyes. Louis lifts her up in his
	arms.

				LOUIS
		He can protect us, Claudia.

				CLAUDIA
		You really believe that?


	EXT. DOLL-SHIP - NIGHT

	Claudia, staring at the dolls. We see Madeleine inside,
	painting a doll. She sees Claudia and smiles and waves.


	INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

	Louis, sitting alone in the box, as the curtains draw
	back, to show Santiago as death, as before. Louis takes
	advantage of the darkness to slip away.


	INT. ARMAND'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Armand opens the door to Louis' knock.

				ARMAND
		I was waiting for you...

				LOUIS
		Listen to me.

	He follows Armand into the room.

				LOUIS
		Claudia is dear to me. My...
		daughter.

				ARMAND
		Your lover.

				LOUIS
		No, my beloved, my child.

				ARMAND
		If you say so. You are innocent.

				LOUIS
		I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid.
		She feels she's in danger from the
		others.

				ARMAND
		She is.

				LOUIS
		But why?

				ARMAND
		I could give you reasons. Her
		silence. Her youth. It's forbidden
		to make so young, so helpless, that
		cannot survive on its own.

				LOUIS
		Then blame the one who made her...

				ARMAND
		Did you kill this vampire who made
		you both? Is that why you won't say
		his name? Santiago thinks you did.

				LOUIS
		We want no quarrel with him.

				ARMAND
		It's already begun. If you want to
		save her, send her away.

				LOUIS
		Then I leave too.

	Armand smiles.

				ARMAND
		So soon? Without any of those
		answers you so longed for?

				LOUIS
		You said there were none.

				ARMAND
		But you asked the wrong questions.
		Do you know how few vampires have
		the stamina for immortality? How
		quickly they perish of their own
		will.

				LOUIS
		We can do that?

				ARMAND
		You would never give up life. If
		the world were reduced to one empty
		cell, on fragile candle, you stay
		alive and study it. You see too
		clearly. You see too much.

				LOUIS
		That's what the one who made me
		said.

				ARMAND
		How he must have loved you.

	Armand suddenly grips Louis close to him.

				ARMAND
		Louis, I need you more than he ever
		did. I need a link with this
		century. The world changes. We do
		not. Therein lies the irony that
		ultimately kills us. I need you to
		make contact with this age.

	Louis laughs bitterly.

				LOUIS
		He? Don't you see? I'm not the
		spirit of any age! I'm at odds with
		everything and always have been!
		I'm not even sure what I am!

	Armand smiles.

				ARMAND
		But Louis, that is the very spirit
		of your age. The heart of it. You
		fall from grace has been the fall
		of a century.

	Louis is stunned.

				LOUIS
		And the vampires of the Theatre?

				ARMAND
		Like moths around the candle of the
		age. Decadent, useless. They can't
		reflect anything. But you do. You
		reflect its broken heart.

	Louis is speechless.

				ARMAND
		Are these not the answers you came
		for?

				LOUIS
			(softly)
		Yes... My God...

				ARMAND
		A vampire with a human soul. An
		immortal with a mortal's passion.
		You are beautiful, my friend.
		Lestat must have wept when he made
		you -

				LOUIS
		Lestat! You knew Lestat!

				ARMAND
		Yes I knew him. Knew him well
		enough not to mourn his passing.

	Armand stands. He takes Louis by the arm, leads him
	towards the back wall.

				ARMAND
		But you must go now. You must get
		her safely out of Paris.

	He opens a hidden door in the wall.

				ARMAND
		No-one else knows of this door.
		When you knock you will find me
		waiting...


	EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - NIGHT

	Louis, in the street outside, as the door closes behind
	him.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I felt a kind of peace at last. I
		had found the teacher which Lestat
		could never, I knew now, have been.
		I knew knowledge would never be
		withheld by Armand. It would pass
		through him as through a pane of
		glass. And I knew Claudia must
		leave me...


	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

	Louis enters. There is unfamiliar scent in the air, a
	doll sitting by the mirror. Louis looks in the mirror
	and sees...


	MADELEINE

	The doll-maker, resplendent in green taffeta, sitting
	like a Madonna with Claudia on her lap. Claudia's arms
	are wound round her neck. The contrast between mortal
	woman and immortal child is plain.

				CLAUDIA
		Madeleine... Louis is shy.

	Madeleine rises and comes towards Louis. She draws back
	the lace fringes round her throat, so he can see the
	two marks there. She says softly, dreamily.

				MADELEINE
		Drink.

	Louis turns away. Claudia speaks, icy, from the bed.

				CLAUDIA
		Do it Louis. Because I cannot do
		it. I haven't the strength. You saw
		to that when you made me.

	Louis turns to Madeleine.

				LOUIS
		You haven't the vaguest conception
		under God of what you ask!

				MADELEINE
		Au contraire, monsieur, I have.

	Louis pushes her away. Claudia screams.

				CLAUDIA
		You have found your new companion,
		Louis! You will make me mine!

	Louis grips Madeleine and shakes her.

				LOUIS
		How do we seem to you? Do you think
		us beautiful, magical, our white
		skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you
		ask me! Have you any idea of the
		thing you will become?

				CLAUDIA
		Your evil is that you cannot be
		evil! And I will suffer for it no
		longer!

				LOUIS
		Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do
		it!

				CLAUDIA
		Yet you could do it to me!
		Snatching me from my mother's hands
		like two monsters in a fairy-tale!
		Couldn't you have waited? Six more
		years and I would have had that
		shape! And now you weep! You
		haven't tears enough for what
		you've done to me.

	She points to Madeleine

				CLAUDIA
		You give her to me! Do this before
		you leave me!

	She begins to weep, sobbing like a child.

				CLAUDIA
		Oh God! I love you still, that's
		the torment of it. But you know I
		must leave you Louis...

				LOUIS
		Yes...

				CLAUDIA
		And who will care for me my love,
		my dark angel, when you are gone?

	Louis looks at Madeleine

				LOUIS
		You promise to care for her then?

				MADELEINE
		Yes...

				LOUIS
		And you know what you ask for?

	She wraps her arms around Claudia.

				MADELEINE
		Yes.

				LOUIS
		What do you think she is,
		Madeleine? A doll?

				MADELEINE
		A child who can't die...

	Her finger clutches a locket around her neck, Louis
	touches it, opens it.


	THE LOCKET

	A picture of a young girl, Claudia's age, wistful,
	beautiful.

				LOUIS
			(softly)
		And the child who did die?

				MADELEINE
		My daughter...

	Louis takes her chin in his hand, gently.

				LOUIS
		Look at the gaslight. Don't take
		your eyes off it. You will be
		drained to the point of death, but
		you must stay alive. Do you hear
		me?

				MADELEINE
		Yes!

	Louis pulls her to him and starts to drink her blood.


	EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - LATER

	Louis on the balcony, weakened terribly. A breeze blows
	on the gauze curtains behind him, through which we
	see...

	SILHOUETTES of Madeleine and Claudia. Madeleine her
	arms outstretched, now a vampire, a long moan of pain
	coming from her. Claudia comes through the curtains,
	alarmed.

				CLAUDIA
			(whispers)
		Louis!

	Louis speaks without turning.

				LOUIS
		She is dying. It happened to you
		too, but your child's mind can't
		remember.

				CLAUDIA
		But if she dies...

				LOUIS
		It's only mortal death.

	He turns to look at Claudia.

				LOUIS
		Bear me no ill will, my love. We
		are now even.

				CLAUDIA
		What do you mean?

				LOUIS
		What died tonight inside that room
		was not that woman. It will take
		her many nights to die, perhaps
		years. What has died in that room
		tonight is the last vestige in me
		of what was human.

	She takes his hand.

				CLAUDIA
		Yes father. At last. We are een.

	He bends down and kisses her. He looks up, at the
	wafting curtains. He sees -


	MANY VAMPIRE SHADOWS

	Silhouetted, coming closer.


	CLAUDIA

	Looks up and screams.


	THE CURTAINS

	Are ripped aside. The vampires of the Theatre surge
	through.

				ESTELLE
		Time for justice, little one.

	The vampires close on them as Louis struggles,
	Claudia's scream pierces the night air.


	INT. CORRIDOR OF THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - NIGHT

	In a press of vampires, Louis, Claudia and Madeleine
	are forced down the dark corridor. Into -


	THE BALLROOM

	Vampire chaos, as they are dragged through. Louis
	struggling like a demon.

				LOUIS
		Armand! Get me Armand! he wouldn't
		countenance this -

				SANTIAGO
		You can make no demands here!
		Buffoon! Bastard -

	Santiago strikes Louis to the ground. As he struggles
	to his feet, he sees the vampires part around a figure
	coming through. He gasps at the sight of -


	LESTAT

	Dressed beautifully, but horribly scarred now, from the
	fire as well as the earlier stabbing. Lestat is
	confused, ancient, teetering, reaching for Santiago's
	shoulder to steady himself.

				LESTAT
		Louis...

				SANTIAGO
		Is he the one?

	Lestat shakes his head.

				LESTAT
		No, the child. The child was the
		one...

				SANTIAGO
		All the murderers!!!

				LOUIS
		You are alive, Lestat! It can't be
		murder! Tell them how you treated
		us...

	Lestat reaches out to Louis.

				LESTAT
		No... You come back to me Louis...

				LOUIS
		Are you mad???

				ESTELLE
		The sentence is death! To all of
		them!!!

				LESTAT
		Only the girl - it was the girl -

	The sound of something being dragged through the crowd.
	Horrible echoing, scraping -

	Lestat grips Santiago.

				LESTAT
		You promised me - I could take him
		back to New Orleans - Louis -
		there's something I must tell you -
		about that night - that night I met
		you -

	He stares around him, confused. The scraping gets
	louder.

				LOUIS
		You let her go, Lestat - you let
		her free - and I'll come back with
		you -

	Santiago grabs Louis by the neck.

				SANTIAGO
		Death for the others. For you
		eternity in a box -

	We see now what caused the scraping. A huge metal
	coffin being dragged through the vampires. Claudia
	screams.

				SANTIAGO
		Walled in a dungeon. Your only
		company will be your screams...
		Perhaps it will take centuries...

	The vampires grab Louis. They force him towards the
	coffin. Lestat struggles with them.

				LESTAT
		He's coming home with me - you
		promised -

				SANTIAGO
			(laughing)
		We promised nothing!

	Louis struggles fiercely as he is forced into the
	coffin. Claudia weeps.

				LOUIS
		They've fooled you, Lestat! You
		must reach Armand! Armand has the
		power!

	Louis, struggling in the coffin. Then the lid is forced
	down, huge locks closed over it.


	INT. COFFIN

	Louis, in the smallest imaginable space. Beating his
	forehead against the metal.


	EXT. COFFIN

	Claudia, throwing herself on the coffin, crying. She is
	dragged away. Vampire hands drag the coffin across the
	stone floor.


	INT. COFFIN

	Louis, forehead pouring with blood, being thrown this
	way and that. The coffin is lifted, upside down, Louis'
	head crashes off the floor.


	EXT. COFFIN

	Is thrust into a niche in the wall. Bricks being placed
	over, mortar trowelled on.


	INT. COFFIN

	Louis upside down. Sounds of bricks and mortar. Then
	terrifying, unearthly scream pierces the coffin,
	striking to his very soul.

				LOUIS
		Claudia!!!

	He loses consciousness.


	BLACKNESS

	INT. COFFIN

	Louis sleeps, upside down. Sound of bricks being
	broken, thrown aside. Then of locks breaking.

	Louis opens his eyes. The lid opens. He sees -

				ARMAND
		Above him, reaching down to take
		his hand.

				ARMAND
		Hurry. Don't make a sound.

	Louis gets out, into a vast long catacomb. Louis runs
	to the end of it, steps through a broken brick wall.

				LOUIS
		Where is she? Where's Claudia?

				ARMAND
		Follow me - that way - through my
		cell -

	He points to his cell at the end of the passage, the
	foot of the steps. Sound of rain beyond the door.

				LOUIS
		Not without Claudia. Where is she?

				ARMAND
		I can't save her.

				LOUIS
		You can't believe I'd leave without
		her. Armand! You must save her! You
		have no choice.

				ARMAND
		Louis, I can't save her. I will
		only risk losing you -

	Louis runs up the stone stairs. It leads to the
	ballroom. He enters.

	Estelle stands far off, looking at him coolly. She
	lifts the stage skull mask and laughs softly behind it.
	A male vampire slumps in a chair staring softly at
	Louis.

	Silence. Indifference.

	Louis sees Lestat sitting in a far corner. he rushes up
	to Lestat, who looks up at him, confused. He's holding
	something crumpled, made of cloth.

				LESTAT
		You'll come home with me Louis? For
		a little while... until I am myself
		again.

				LOUIS
		CLAUDIA!!!

	Louis turns round and round in rage. Passive still
	faces. A door bangs open and shut.

	Louis looks again at Lestat. He snatches the cloth from
	Lestat's hand. We see it is a small torn bloodstained
	dress. Claudia's dress.

	The door bangs again. Estelle laughs. Rain gusts into
	the ballroom.

	Louis goes to the door, holding the dress. Armand
	approaches, trying to pull him away, but Louis shrugs
	him off. He draws nearer and nearer and stairs at -


	INT. BRICK AIRWELL

	On the stones lie Claudia and Madeleine, burn to ashes,
	in each other's arms, like the corpses of his wife and
	daughter in the New Orleans graveyard, embracing each
	other.

	Only Claudia's blond hair and Madeleine's red hair
	remain unburnt.

	Louis looks up at the walls of this airwell, many
	stories to the sky. He cries out in agony.

	Santiago appears behind him, staring. Louis roars in
	horror and attacks Santiago, scattering the ashes into
	the rainy wind. Claudia's golden locks fly up into the
	wind, they whirl around the warring figure.

	Armand appears, drags Louis free, pulls him screaming
	from the airwell, into the ballroom, towards the exit.

	Claudia's hair is sucked up by the wind through the
	airwell, towards the night sky.


	EXT. NOTRE DAME DOOR - NIGHT

	Louis is slumped against the stone wall. Armand stands
	beside him like a guardian angel.

				ARMAND
		I couldn't prevent it.

				LOUIS
		I don't believe you. I do not have
		to read your soul to know that you
		lie.

				ARMAND
		Louis, they cannot be brought back.
		There are some things that are
		impossible, even for me.

				LOUIS
		You let them do it.

	Louis climbs to his feet.

				LOUIS
		You held sway over them. They
		feared you. You wanted it to
		happen.

				ARMAND
		Louis, I swear I did not.

				LOUIS
		I understand you only too well. You
		let them do it, as I let Lestat
		turn a child into a demon. As I let
		her rip Lestat's heart to pieces!
		Well I am no longer that passive
		fool that has spun evil from evil
		till the web traps the one who made
		it. Your melancholy spirit of this
		century! I know what I must do. And
		I warn you - you saved me tonight,
		so I return the favor - do not go
		near your cell in the Theatre Des
		Vampires again.


	EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - DAWN

	Wet and deserted, the streets around the theatre are
	quiet.


	CLOSEUP - CLOCK

	Chiming five a.m.


	CLOSE ON LOUIS

	Looking at the paling sky. He is in an alleyway,
	outside of Armand's cell. He has a huge keg with him.
	he finds the door unlocked. He enters.


	INT. CELL

	Empty. The hearth is cold. The old coffin is gone.
	Louis silently closes the door to the passage and
	blocks it with an immense bar. He goes in the other
	door.


	INT. THEATRE

	Louis hurls kerosene all over the stage, the curtain,
	the sets, the seats below. He grabs the scythe from the
	playlet. He walks out. Dribbling a trail of kerosene
	behind him.


	INT. STAIRS

	Louis walking rapidly down, leaving the trail of
	kerosene. He creeps quietly into the -


	BALLROOM

	Leaking kerosene from the cask. He splashes over the
	coffins that gleam in the dimness.

	Then he strikes a match and heaves it into the
	kerosene. Everything bursts into flame. The trail of
	kerosene roars into fire through the ballroom over the
	coffins and up the stairs. We hear EXPLOSIONS of fire
	from above.


	LOUIS

	Shudders all over, fighting the morning weakness. He
	readies the scythe, like the grim reaper.


	ESTELLE

	Rises from her burning coffin, screams and tries to run
	through the fire but Louis slashes her down with the
	scythe and she goes down screaming, her dress in
	flames.

				ESTELLE
		Stop him. It's morning. The
		sunlight. Stop him.

	Others rise, choking in the smoke. Screams from
	everywhere. They are burning.

	Louis backs up the stairs to the -


	DUNGEON

	He can see there a thin pale light under Armand's
	bolted door. Suddenly -


	SANTIAGO

	Comes at him from behind. Louis turns. Santiago rushes
	him in a blur. Louis swings the scythe, too fast to see
	what he himself is doing. Santiago's head streaming
	blood flies through the air.

	The body drops, flapping its arms.

	SCREAMS come from everywhere.

	Another vampire rushes burning towards Louis. He
	decapitates him in turn. Then he staggers into Armand's
	cell, and bars the door the connects it to the ballroom
	behind him. He staggers to the outer door. There is a
	thin strip of daylight, beneath the door, blinding him.
	He throws it open, and staggers into the daylight.


	EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - DAWN

	Louis staggers out of the burning theatre, into the
	thin daylight. Great gusts of smoke cover the street.
	He staggers through the daylight, weakening, about to
	fall, when through the clouds of smoke comes -


	A MAGNIFICENT HEARSE

	As in a dream, driven by Armand's human boy. The door
	of the hearse opens. Through the curtains enclosing the
	interior, we see Armand. He reaches a hand out to Louis
	and pulls him inside.

	The hearse vanishes through the smoke, leaving the
	spectacle of the burning theatre.


	EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - TWILIGHT

	The gutted Theatre and ballroom, the roof collapsed,
	exposed to the evening sky. The life of Paris goes on
	around it, oblivious.


	INT. LOUVRE - NIGHTS LATER

	It is already a museum by this time and Louis and
	Armand, fancily dressed and composed, walk through it.
	They stop by a Gericault - The Wreck of the Medusa.

				LOUIS
		You didn't even warm them, did you?

				ARMAND
		No.

				LOUIS
		And yet you knew what I would do.

				ARMAND
		I knew. I rescued you, didn't I?
		From the terrible dawn.

				LOUIS
		You were their leader. They trusted
		you.

				ARMAND
		You made me see their failings,
		Louis. You made me look at them
		with your eyes.

	He looks at Louis affectionately.

				ARMAND
		Your melancholy eyes...

				LOUIS
		What a pair we are. We deserve each
		other, don't we?

				ARMAND
		We are a pair, and that's what
		counts.

	Armand and Louis walk slowly through the Louvre
	together. Camera follows them for a while, then comes
	to rest on a sunrise by Turner.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		We left Paris shortly after. For
		years we wandered. Greece, Egypt,
		all the ancient lands. Then, out of
		curiosity, perhaps, boredom, who
		knows what, I took him home, to my
		America...


	INT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

	A deco cinema of the twenties. Louis and Armand,
	dressed in the style of the period walk down the aisle
	through the crowded seats.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		And there, a technological wonder
		allowed me see sunrise, for the
		first time in two hundred years...

	On the screen, Murnau's "Sunrise", in black and white.
	We see a montage of sunrises, from a whole range of
	movies, in black and white.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		And what sunrises! Seen as the
		human eye could never see them. We
		would sit in the dark, night after
		night among nameless humans,
		entranced with the miracle of
		light. Silver at first, then as the
		years progressed in tones of
		purple, red and my long-lost
		blue...

	The SUNRISES continue, in color now, and the
	backgrounds in them change to the fifties.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		And in time parted. We had become
		so alike, we both wanted the
		certainties of loneliness once
		more.

	The lights come up in a different theatre. Louis
	sitting there, alone, in a half empty theatre, dressed
	in the clothes of the fifties. He rises, exits with the
	others.


	EXT. NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT

	Cars rushing by, twentieth-century madness. Louis
	emerges from the theatre, walks through the streets.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I had returned to new Orleans. As
		soon as I smelt the air, I knew I
		was home. There was sadness there,
		rich, almost sweet, like the
		fragrance of jasmine. I walked the
		streets, savoring it like a long
		lost perfume...


	EXT. GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT

	Louis walks past the many Greek Revival Mansions.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		And then on Prytania Street, only
		blocks from the Lafayette cemetery
		I caught the scent of death and it
		wasn't coming from the graves...

	CAMERA PANS OVER white-walled Lafayette cemetery and
	its surrounding mansions.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		The scent grew stronger as I
		walked. Old death. A scent too
		faint for mortals to detect.

	Louis sees rats darting across the street. They rush
	into a great overgrown garden surrounding a ruined
	mansion. No lights.

	Louis stops at a rusted gate. He forces it open and
	enters -


	A VERITABLE JUNGLE

	Of overgrown rose and oak tree and wisteria. he sees a
	faint glimmer of light coming from a distant glass
	window of a huge Greek Revival house. He approaches
	then he sees -


	OLD SHRIVELLED CORPSE

	Of a man, long dead and dried up, snagged in the thorny
	rosevines.


	LOUIS

	Looks around. Walks on. Sees another corpse, almost
	nothing but bones, sinking into the wet earth, the
	roots of an oak overgrowing it.

	He looks up at the distant light.

	He passes a third corpse, caught in wisteria and rose
	vine, only bones and clothes.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		They were like the doomed princess
		caught in the thorny vines of
		Sleeping Beauty's castle. I knew
		what it meant. A vampire had lured
		them here, but had been to weak to
		get rid of them.

	Louis sees dead rats lying near the steps.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		It spelt weakness, madness, the
		behavior of a dying animal that
		pollutes its own lair.

	Louis treads carefully on the rotted steps. he moves
	along the porch. More dead rats. He sees through the
	floor-length window into rooms lined with stacked
	books. Virtually walled with them. Water seeps down
	from the ceiling, gleaming as it streaks over the
	books. The floors of the splendid rooms are bare,
	except for a rotten French chair by a dead fireplace. A
	single mirror reflecting the moon.

	Dead rats.

	He moves along the porch to the parlor windows. The
	candle flickers inside. He sees -


	HIS POV

	Lestat lying on the floor. He is gaunt to near
	starvation. All his scars are gone, but he is almost a
	skeleton and his eyes are enormous in their sockets.
	His clothes are rags. Blond hair beautiful, as always.


	MALLOY'S ENTRANCES FACE SUPERIMPOSED OVER

				MALLOY (V.O.)
		Lestat escaped the fire!

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		He hadn't even been there. And all
		those years I thought he was dead.


	BACK TO LESTAT

	One tiny candle stands beside him. He reads an early
	comic, from the turn of the century. Without turning
	his head, he speaks.

				LESTAT
		I'm so glad you're here Louis...
		I've dreamed of your coming...

				LOUIS
		Don't try to speak... it's
		alright...

				LESTAT
		I didn't mean to let them do it...
		that Santiago, he tricked me...

				LOUIS
		That's all past, Lestat.

				LESTAT
		Yes. Past... she should never have
		been one of us...

	He turns and looks at Louis. Old, fearful, broken.

				LESTAT
		Still beautiful Louis. You always
		were the strong one.

				LOUIS
		Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you
		no harm.

				LESTAT
		You've come back to me, Louis?
		You've come again to me?

	Louis shakes his head. A series of police sirens go by,
	piercing the night sky. A helicopter goes overhead. Red
	flashes illuminate his face. Lestat shivers, covers his
	ears. He's terrified. Louis touches him, calming him,
	until the lights pass over.

				LOUIS
		It's only a siren...

				LESTAT
		I can't bear it Louis! The machines
		out there, that fly and that roar!
		And such lights! They make the
		night brighter than the day!

				LOUIS
		And they frighten you?

				LESTAT
		You know I love the dark. But
		there's no dark anymore.

				LOUIS
		It's false light, Lestat. It can't
		harm you...

				LESTAT
		If you stayed with me Louis, I
		could venture out... little by
		little... become the old Lestat.

	Louis shivers. He releases him.

				LOUIS
		I have to go now Lestat...

				LESTAT
		You remember how I was, Louis.. the
		vampire Lestat...

				LOUIS
		Yes. I remember...

	Lestat shivers.

				LESTAT
		I tried to tell you Louis... that
		night in Paris... when I first came
		to you... no-one can refuse the
		dark gift, Louis... not even you.

				LOUIS
		I tried...

				LESTAT
		And the more you tried, the more I
		wanted you... a vampire with your
		beautiful, suffering human heart.
		And how you suffered... I need your
		forgiveness, Louis.

				LOUIS
		You have it...

	Louis walks slowly away from him. Lestat turns back to
	his candle, his magazine.

				LESTAT
		You'll come back, Louis... take me
		out... little by little... and
		maybe I'll be myself again...

	A bluebottle buzzes by him. His hand shoots out and
	grabs it, squeezes the blood.

				LOUIS
			(whispering)
		Yes, Lestat...


	ON LOUIS

	As he walks through the decayed house. His eyes are
	expressionless.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		And my story ends there. But in
		fact it ended a long time ago, with
		Claudia's ashes in that theatre. My
		love died with her. I never really
		changed after that. What became of
		Lestat I have no idea. I go on,
		night after night. I feed on those
		who cross my path. But all my
		passion went with her yellow hair.
		I ma a spirit with preternatural
		flesh. Detached. unchangeable.
		Empty.


	INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT (PRESENT)

	Malloy, staring at Louis.

				MALLOY
		No... it can't end like that...

				LOUIS
		But it has. There is no more to
		tell.

				MALLOY
		But you talk about passion, about
		longing, about things I'll never
		know in my life! It's still inside
		you, in every syllable you speak!
		And then you tell me it ends like
		that? Just empty?

				LOUIS
		It's over, I'm telling you...

				MALLOY
		You need a new passion, Louis, a
		new reason to feel... what a story
		you've told, you don't understand
		yourself.

	Louis looks at the cassettes on the table.

				LOUIS
		Do what you want with it. Learn
		what you can. Give the story to
		others.

	Malloy rises.

				MALLOY
		You have another chance, Louis.
		Take me! Give me your gift, your
		power...

	Louis is slowly horrified, then outraged and angry.

				LOUIS
		Is this what you want? You ask me
		for this after all I've told you?

				MALLOY
		If I could see what you've seen,
		feel what you've felt I wouldn't
		let it end like this! You need a
		like to the world out there, a
		connection... then it won't end
		like this...

	He stares at Louis.

				MALLOY
		You need me.

	Louis turns away.

				LOUIS
		Dear God. I've failed again,
		haven't I?

				MALLOY
		No...

				LOUIS
		Don't say anymore. The reels are
		still turning. I have but one
		chance to show you the meaning of
		what I've said.

	He looks at the boy. Then suddenly grabs him, lifts him
	off the floor, bares his terrifying fangs and brings
	them to his throat. Malloy screams, in involuntary
	terror.

				LOUIS
		You like it? You like being food
		for the immortals? You like dying?
		Is it beautiful? Is it intense?

	Malloy, now terrified, whispers

				MALLOY
		No... please...

	Louis drops him.

				LOUIS
		Thank God.

	Malloy, falls on the floor, terrified. When he looks
	up, Louis has vanished.

				MALLOY
		Louis... Louis...

	He looks up at the tape. It is still turning.

				MALLOY
		Holy shit...

	He shakes his head. He gets up, and with shaking
	fingers gathers his tapes. He runs out of the room.


	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE - NIGHT

	Malloy running for his car, a convertible. He leaps in
	and screeches off through the night.


	EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

	Malloy whips the car through the tiny streets, in
	sheer, unfocused terror.

				MALLOY
		Jesus...


	EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT

	Malloy driving with streams of traffic over the bridge.
	He breathes deeply, to calm himself. He takes a tape
	from his pocket, and with still shaking hands, sticks
	it in the deck.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
			(tape)
		1791. That's when it happened. I
		was twenty-four. Younger then you
		are now.

	Suddenly a bony hand shoots out from the back seat,
	pulls his neck backwards -


	LESTAT

	Sinks his teeth in his neck.


	MALLOY'S HANDS

	On the wheel, shaking, shuddering, losing their grip.


	MALLOY'S EYES

	Bulging, as the life drains out of him. Lestat sucking
	him like a rat.


	THE WHEEL

	Swinging free of Malloy's dying hands.


	THE CAR

	Veers wildly into oncoming traffic.


	LESTAT

	Drinks regardless.


	A TRUCK

	Coming towards them, about to crush the car.


	LESTAT'S BONY HAND

	Grabs the wheel, jerks it as he drinks.


	THE CAR

	Misses the truck by inches.


	LESTAT

	Throws Malloy to one side, climbs into the front seat.

	The tape is playing.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
			(tape)
		My invitation was open to anyone.
		Sailors, whores, thieves. But it
		was a vampire that accepted...


	ON LESTAT

	At the wheel, the corpse of Malloy in the passenger
	seat. He smiles. We can see the blood renewing him.

				LESTAT
		Dear Louis... will I ever forget?


	EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT

	Lestat drives on, the car a tiny speck against the
	bridge, the sea, the sky beyond, with the first fingers
	of light spreading through it.

									 FADE IN:


	INT. ROOM - NIGHT (SAN FRANCISCO)

	A small bare room, illuminated only by the streetlight
	coming through the window.

	A hand presses a cassette into a recorder and fiddles
	with a small microphone.

	Malloy sits over a table fiddling with the tape. He is
	young, half-shaven, dressed in T-shirt and jeans. He
	looks too -

	LOUIS, who stands by the window, looking out on the
	street, with his back to Malloy. Louis is dressed in an
	old-fashioned suit.

				LOUIS
		So you want me to tell you the
		story of my life...

				MALLOY
		That's what I do. I interview
		people. I collect lives. F.M.
		radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed
		a genuine hero, a cop who -

				LOUIS
			(quietly interrupting)
		You'd have to have a lot of tape
		for my story. I've had a very
		unusual life.

				MALLOY
		So much the better. I've got a
		pocket full of tapes.

				LOUIS
		You followed me here, didn't you?

				MALLOY
		Saw you in the street outside. You
		seemed interesting. Is this where
		you live?

				LOUIS
		It's just a room...

				MALLOY
		So shall we begin?
			(playfully, almost
			teasing)
		What do you do?

				LOUIS
		I'm a vampire.

	Malloy laughs.

				MALLOY
		See? I knew you were interesting.
		You mean this literally, I take it?

				LOUIS
		Absolutely. I was watching you
		watching me. I was waiting for you
		in that alleyway. And then you
		began to speak.

				MALLOY
		Well, what a lucky break for me.

				LOUIS
		Perhaps lucky for both of us.

	Still in shadow he turns from the window and approaches
	the table.

				LOUIS
		I'll tell you my story. All of it.
		I'd like to do that very much.

	Malloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure,
	fascinated but afraid.

				MALLOY
		You were going to kill me? Drink my
		blood?

				LOUIS
		Yes but you needn't worry about
		that now. Things change.

	Louis stands opposite, hand on the chair. Malloy is
	riveted.

				MALLOY
		You believe this, don't you? That
		you're a vampire? You really
		think...

				LOUIS
		We can't begin this way. Let me
		turn on the light.

				MALLOY
		But I thought vampires didn't like
		the light.

				LOUIS
		We love it. I only wanted to
		prepare you.

	Louis pulls the chord of the overhead naked light bulb.


	LOUIS' FACE

	Appears inhumanly white, eyes glittering. Inhuman or
	not alive. the effect is subtle, beautiful and ghastly.

				MALLOY
		Good God!

	He struggles to suppress fear and understand.

				LOUIS
		Don't be frightened. I want this
		opportunity.

	The light appears to go out by itself and suddenly
	Louis is in the chair, dimly lit by the street-light
	from the window. The cassette is turning.

				MALLOY
		How did you do that?

				LOUIS
		The same way you do it. A series of
		simple gestures. Only I moved too
		fast for you to see. I'm flesh and
		blood, you see. But not human. I
		haven't been human for two hundred
		years.

	Malloy is speechless, frightened yet enthralled.

				LOUIS
		What can I do to put you at ease?
		Shall we begin like David
		Copperfield? I am born, I grow up.
		Or shall we begin when I was born
		to darkness, as I call it. That's
		really where we should start, don't
		you think?

				MALLOY
		You're not lying to me, are you?

				LOUIS
		Why should I lie? 1791 was the year
		it happened. I was twenty-four -
		younger than you are now.

				MALLOY
		Yes.

				LOUIS
		But times were different then. I
		was a man at that age. The master
		of a large plantation just south of
		New Orleans...

									 DISSOLVE
									 TO:


	EXT. LOUISIANA - DAY (1791)

	A disheveled Louis, hair in pigtail, in deep pocket
	frock coat, rides his horse through the fields of
	indigo, passing an overseer and slaves at work.

	He passes slave quarters and the distant colonial
	mansion of Pointe du Lac.

	He comes to a small parish church and a graveyard. he
	dismounts and walks through the tombs to an elaborate
	one in Greek Style.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I had just lost my wife in
		childbirth. She and the infant had
		been buried less than half a year.

	There is a marble angel above the tomb, feminine, with
	a tiny cherub angel in her arms. Louis looks from the
	angel, down to the inscriptions on the tomb:

	"DIANNE DE POINTE DU LAC 1763 - 1791
	INFANT JEAN MARIE - 1791"

	Louis rips away the vines already covering the
	inscription, then drinks from a pocket-flask. His face
	is ashen.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I was twenty-four and life seemed
		finished. I couldn't bear the pain
		of their loss. I longed for a
		release from it.


	INT. WATERFRONT TAVERN - NIGHT

	Louis in ragged lace and dirty brocade sitting between
	two whores at a gaming table, drinking absinthe. All
	around him flatboatmen, whores, gamblers, black African
	freedmen.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I wanted to lose everything. My
		wealth, my estate, my sanity. But
		Lady Luck didn't oblige.

	Louis displays a hand of four aces. A gambler at the
	table stands in fury, over turning money, cards,
	drinks.

				LOUIS
		You're calling me a cheat?

				GAMBLER
		I'm calling you a piece of shit -

	The Gambler pulls out a pearl-handled pistol and points
	it at Louis. The crowd hushes and draws back. Louis
	smiles drunkenly and stands. he rips open his lace
	shirt, exposing his chest.

				LOUIS
		Then do me a favor. Get rid of this
		piece of shit...

	The Gambler's finger on the trigger. His hand shakes.

				LOUIS
		You lack the courage of your
		convictions, sir. Do it.

	LESTAT, a hooded figure in the corner, smiles from
	beneath the shadow of his hood. Gleaming blue eyes.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Most of all I longed for death. I
		know that now. I invited it, a
		release from the pain of living...

	The Gambler lowers his gun, scowling. Louis pockets the
	fistfulls of coins he has won.


	EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

	Loud, crowded riverfront taverns full of ruffians.
	Louis staggers down, an arm around a whore, drinking
	from a bottle. A pockmarked pimp follows behind.

				LOUIS
		My invitation was open to anyone.
		Sailors, thieves, whores and
		slaves...


	EXT. WHARF - NIGHT

	Louis, quite insensible, being propped up against a
	wall by the whore in a dank wharf over the water. The
	pimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to
	slice his throat, when a shadow falls over him. He
	turns, and we see the face of Lestat, who lifts him
	into the air by his throat, breaking his neck. the
	whore screams and Lestat's other hand clamps over her
	mouth. Lestat drags her towards him. Louis falls to the
	ground, supported no more, insensible. Close on his
	face, as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore,
	off.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		But it was a vampire that accepted.


	IN THE WATER

	The bodies of the thief and whore float by. Above on
	the wharf, Louis, now awake, stares down at them. He
	turns, to see Lestat, towering above him.

				LESTAT
		They would have killed you -

				LOUIS
		Then my luck would have changed.

				LESTAT
		You want death? Is it death you
		want?

				LOUIS
		Yes...

	Lestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the
	air, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his
	teeth in his neck.


	ON LOUIS' FACE

	Every muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is
	drained from him.


	ON THEIR FEET

	Hovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers.

	THE WIND billows through the ghostly white sails and
	rigging of the boats around the wharf.


	LESTAT

	Floats higher, with Louis in his arms, draining his
	blood. One hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging
	from a shipmast. The other holds Louis. He withdraws
	his teeth, and looks into Louis' drained face.

				LESTAT
		You still want death? Or have you
		tasted it enough?

	Louis can barely get the words out.

				LOUIS
		Enough...

	Lestat smiles and lets him go. Louis falls and plummets
	into the water below.


	LOUIS' FACE

	Coming to the surface, in the water lapping by the
	wharf. The bodies of the whore and thief float beside
	him. He looks up and sees Lestat way above him,
	dangling from the rope of the shipmast.


	INT. ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO

	ON MALLOY'S FACE

	Captivated, terrified, enthralled.

				MALLOY
		That's how it happened?

				LOUIS
		No. The Gift of Darkness requires
		more than that, as you'll see.


	EXT. WATERFRONT - DAY

	Louis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish,
	the carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish.
	He gets to his feet and walks weakly through the
	mudflats. The sun is coming up over the sea behind him.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		He left me half dead that morning.
		he wanted something from me. He
		came back the following night.


	INT. LAVISH FRENCH-FURNISHED BEDROOM AT POINT DU LAC

	Louis is delirious in a four-poster bed, shrouded with
	mosquito netting. A female slave, YVETTE, bathes his
	face with a rag. She is crying. Other slave women hover
	in the shadows. Yvette puts out all candles save one by
	the bed, and withdraws, with the others.

	Candlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin.

	Louis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring
	incoherently. Then he opens his eyes.

	LESTAT, exquisitely dressed in French clothing, stands
	by the bed smiling. In the light of the candle we see
	that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright.
	Lestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible
	- and angel or monster.

	Louis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it.

				LOUIS
		Who the hell are you? What are you
		doing in my house?

				LESTAT
		And a beautiful house it is too.
		Yours is a good life, isn't it?

	Louis takes aim. Lestat puts his hand over the barrel.
	Louis fires. The bullet tears a hole in Lestat's hand.
	Lestat is unfazed. He takes the gun from Louis' hand
	and throws it away. His hand begins to heal.

				LESTAT
		You're not afraid of anything, are
		you?

				LOUIS
		Why should I be?

	Louis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and
	point it. Lestat laughs indulgently. He draws closer.

				LESTAT
		Are you going to put that through
		me too? Ruin my beautiful clothes?

	He comes closer to Louis, right up to his face, so the
	sword passes through his waistcoat.

				LESTAT
		Were all last night's promises for
		nothing?

	He reaches out with his now-healed hand and plucks out
	the sword.

				LOUIS
		What do you want from me?

				LESTAT
		I've come to answer your prayers.
		You want to die, don't you? Life
		has no meaning anymore, does it?

	Lestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. Louis
	is becoming spellbound.

				LESTAT
		The wine has no taste. The food
		sickens you. There seems no reason
		for any of it, does there? But what
		if I could give it back to you?
		Pluck out the pain and give you
		another life? And it would be for
		all time? And sickness and death
		could never touch you again?

	The vampire theme rises, with the sound of a heartbeat.

									 DISSOLVE
									 TO:


	EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

	The camera drifts through the graveyard where Louis'
	wife is buring. Everything is lit with an eerie glow,
	as if seen through some unearthly eye.

				LESTAT
		Vampires, that's what we are.
		Creatures of darkness, only we see
		it that darkness more clearly than
		any mortal has ever seen...

	Louis and Lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the
	overhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and
	child. Above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and
	child.

				LESTAT
		Wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain
		goodbye? To wave away anguish and
		grief? To embrace the peace of the
		unending night?

	The marble fingers of the child on the statue move. The
	angel raises her head and has the face of Louis wife,
	Diane. she raises her hand and touches Louis tear-
	streamed face. The child speaks.

				MARBLE CHILD
		Papa...

	Louis reaches out to embrace them and finds himself
	touching cold marble. He cries out in anguish-

				LOUIS
		Diane!!!!

				LESTAT
		They are gone, Louis. Death took
		them. Death which you can now
		destroy...

				LOUIS
		NO!!!!!


	INT. LOUIS BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Louis, thrashing on the bed in a delirium. Lestat
	places a hand on his forehead and soothes him.

				LESTAT
		You have to ask me for this. You
		have to want it, do you hear me?

				LOUIS
		Give it to me!!!

				LESTAT
		Vampires. We thrive on blood.

				LOUIS
		I want it!

	Lestat bends close as if to drink Louis' blood. Louis
	does not shrink back, but stares into his eyes. Lestat
	draws back, then stands up and goes to the French
	doors.

				LESTAT
		Tomorrow night. You must prove
		yourself. I will give you the
		choice I never had.

	He looks outside.

				LESTAT
		The sun's coming up. Watch it
		carefully. If you come with me
		tomorrow, you'll never see it
		again.

	He leaves. Louis sits dazed, staring at the empty
	French window. The sun rises with unnatural beauty,
	over the swamplands and the plantation, filling the
	room, striking water-pitcher, glass, mirror, and the
	picture of his dead wife.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		My last sunrise. That morning I was
		not yet a vampire, and I saw my
		last sunrise. I remember it
		completely, yet I don't remember
		any sunrise before it. I watched
		the whole magnificence of the dawn
		for the last time, as if it were
		the first. And the I said goodbye
		to sunlight and went out to become
		what I became.


	EXT. PLANTATION - NIGHT

	Lestat and Louis walk through the slave quarters,
	huddles groups around fires, music, singing. The sound
	of whipping is heard.

				LESTAT
		Your grief has unhinged you. You've
		let your estate rot.

	In the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is
	whipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery.

				LESTAT
		You let your overseer run riot,
		work your slaves to the bone. We'll
		start with him.

				LOUIS
		How do you mean, start?

				LESTAT
		Call him.

	Louis calls.

				LOUIS
		Carlos!!!

	The overseer turns and comes towards them, with the
	bloodied whip.

				LESTAT
		Why the bloody whip, Carlos?

	The overseer looks into his eyes, shivers with terror,
	drops the whip and runs for the trees. Lestat is on him
	in an instant. He sinks is teeth in his neck. Louis
	runs to him, tries to pull him off. But Lestat turns to
	Louis and smiles, with his bloodied mouth.

				LESTAT
		Let's call that a start.

				LOUIS
		I can't do it.

				LESTAT
		You've just done it -

				LOUIS
		Kill me if you will, but I can't do
		this...

	He flees, as Lestat ends to finish off the overseer.


	EXT. POINTE DU LAC - NIGHT

	Louis running up the steps leading to the gallery. He
	is crazed with guilt. He looks up and sees -


	LESTAT

	Sitting collected at the head of the steps.


	LOUIS

	Backs away as Lestat rises and descends the steps so
	fluidly he hardly seems to move.

				LESTAT
		Don't worry. He was white trash,
		they come at two a penny. I dumped
		him in the swamp and untied the
		slave, licked his wounds clean.

				LOUIS
		You're the devil, aren't you?
		That's who you are.

				LESTAT
			(gently)
		I wish I were. But if I were, what
		would I want with you?

				LOUIS
		I can't go through with it, I tell
		you.

				LESTAT
		Your perfect. Your bitter and
		you're strong.

				LOUIS
		But why do you want me?

				LESTAT
		Because you're as strong as I was
		when I was alive.

	Louis takes out his flask and drinks. Drunkenly, he
	turns and heads for a nearby swamp.


	EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Louis stops again in front of the crypt. Drinks from
	the flask, leans his forehead against the stone.

	Lestat appears beside him, radiant, beautiful.

				LESTAT
		You really want to be with them?

				LOUIS
		Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you
		promised -

				LESTAT
		You asked for death. I didn't
		promise it -

	In a quiet rage, Lestat raise his fist and shatters the
	marble face stone, revealing a coffin below. His fist
	shatters that in turn, revealing the half-rotted body
	of a women, holding an infant, no longer recognizable
	as individuals, a tangle of gruesome rotted hair,
	flesh, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling over
	it.

	Louis gasps.

				LESTAT
		It's not your wife and child my
		friend. It's death. Just that
		simple. Think and choose. It
		happens to everyone. Except us.

	Lestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy
	dreamlike vision, then hyperclear. Louis again is
	spellbound. He drops the flask, which shatters on the
	stones.

	Lestat appears angelic in his radiance.

				LESTAT
		We shall be this way always, my
		friend. Young as we are now. I'm
		lonely for a companion, lonely for
		your strength. But I'm not that
		lonely. Do you want to come or not?

	Louis capitulates in one long sigh.

				LOUIS
		Yes...

	Lestat comes closer, smiling.

				LESTAT
		Did I hear a yes?

				LOUIS
		Yes...

	Lestat embraces Louis, obscuring his face. He drinks
	his blood. We hear two heartbeats, out of sync, coming
	together. We see Louis' face, growing paler, paler, as
	his blood is drained. His eyes stare upwards, losing
	their focus.


	LOUIS' POV

	The moon, through hanging vines. The marble statue of
	his wife and child smile at him, as if come alive. Her
	hair blows in the breeze, wonderful gold tresses, the
	child's fingers reach out...


	BACK TO SCENE

	Lestat lets Louis fall down beside the broken crypt.
	Louis looks from the rotting bodies to Lestat above
	him. radiant. Lestat speaks gently.

				LESTAT
		I've drained you to the point of
		death. If you drink from me you
		live for ever. If I leave you here
		you die.

	Lestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows Louis a
	kiss.

				LOUIS
		No. Don't leave me here. Give it to
		me.

	Lestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth. Fangs
	slash his own flesh, blood falls.

				LESTAT
		You're sure?

				LOUIS
		Sure...

	Louis rises to accept the first drops with his open
	mouth. Lestat gathers him up, as Louis clamps his hand
	on Lestat's arm and drinks from the wrist.

	The VAMPIRE THEME swells.

	Lestat watches him drink his wrist with wry amusement.
	Louis finishes, staggers away from him as if drunk.


	LOUIS' POV

	Vampire vision. The world is transformed, the swamp,
	the moon, the clouds, the cry of the night birds all
	come to him with unnatural clarity. He looks down with
	pity at the corpses of his wife and child who appear
	beautiful in death now rather than repulsive. He closes
	the lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground,
	astonished at the ease of it.

	He turns and stares at Lestat whom he sees now with
	vampire's vision. Lestat's eyes are brighter, his
	buttons are glimmering in the light. Everything is
	clearer, brighter, containing more facets of light and
	color.

				LESTAT
		Stop staring at my buttons. Didn't
		I tell you it was going to be fun?

	Lestat leads him into the swamp. Everything astonished
	Louis, as if he's never seen it before. Louis is
	suddenly racked by shudders of pain.

				LESTAT
		You're body's dying. Pay no
		attention. It will take twenty
		minutes at most.

				LOUIS
		Dying?

	Louis dry-retches.

				LESTAT
		It happens to us all.

	Lestat wipes Louis' brow.

				LESTAT
		Come, you're going to feed now.

				LOUIS
		I want a woman.

	Lestat laughs and his laughter echoes like bells in
	Louis' ears.

				LESTAT
		That doesn't matter anymore, Louis.
		You'll see. Come...


	LOUIS' VAMPIRE POV - SWAMP

	Small high ground. Camp of runaway slaves. Several
	share a bottle of rum around the fire. A male slave
	rises. A gorgeous hunk of flesh in the moonlight and
	goes into the swamp to relieve his bladder.

				LESTAT
		They're all beautiful now. Men,
		women, the old, the young...simply
		because they are alive. -

	The slave walks towards them in the darkness. A
	crucifix gleams round his neck.

				LESTAT
		Take him.

				LOUIS
		The crucifix -

				LESTAT
		Forget the crucifix. Take him.

	Louis hesitates.

				LESTAT
		Resist no more Louis. Feed...

	The slave looks up and sees them. Two gleaming white
	beings standing before him with devil's eyes. The he
	runs.

	Louis can resist him no more. He swoops on him with a
	vampire's rapid movement, brings him to the ground and
	sinks his teeth in his neck.

	Close on Louis feeding on the slave, the magnificent
	body shuddering in its death-throes. Lestat stands
	above, laughing.

	The slave dies. Louis rises from him, drunkenly,
	engorged with blood.

				LOUIS
		What have I done?

				LESTAT
		You have fed. You were made for
		this...

	Louis looks down at the body of the slave. Lestat's
	laughter echoes around him.

				LOUIS
		Dear God, what have I done?

				LESTAT
		You've killed Louis. And enjoyed
		it.

	Lestat laughs harder. Louis runs from him, screaming in
	anguish.


	EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

	Louis reaches his wife's grave. He falls to his knees,
	throws back his head and bares his new fangs to the
	moon.

				LOUIS
		Dear God, what have I become????


	INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

	Malloy stares at Louis, terrified and enthralled.

				MALLOY
		You said the slave had a
		crucifix...

				LOUIS
		Oh, that rumor about crosses?

				MALLOY
		You can't look at them...

				LOUIS
		Nonsense, my friend. I can look on
		anything I like. And I am
		particularly fond of looking on
		crucifixes.

				MALLOY
		The story about stakes through the
		heart?

				LOUIS
		The same. As you would say today...
		Bull shit.

				MALLOY
		What about coffins?

				LOUIS
		Coffins... coffins unfortunately
		are a necessity...


	EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

	Louis walks up the steps to the mansion. He looks now
	like a fully-fledged vampire. Yvette, the slave girl
	stares at him from the open doorway. Cascades of
	harpsichord music come from the interior.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Killing is no ordinary act. It is
		the experience of another's life
		for certain. That night I had lost
		my own life and taken another's. I
		was drowning in a sea of human
		guilt and regret, with all the
		heightened senses of a vampire...

	Louis enters the mansion, following the harpsichord
	music, as if in a dream. Yvette draws back as he
	approaches.


	INT. MANSION - NIGHT

	Louis wanders into the parlor, where Lestat is playing
	the harpsichord rapidly and exuberantly. Louis goes to
	a full-length mirror and sees his own reflection there
	- quite the perfect vampire.

				LESTAT
		Yes, that's you, my handsome
		friend. And you'll look that way
		till the stars fall from heaven.

				LOUIS
		It can't be...

				LESTAT
		Give it time. You're like a man who
		loses a limb and still imagines he
		feels pain. It will pass. And we
		must sleep now. I can feel the sun
		approaching.


	EXT. POINTE DU LAC

	Dawn spreading over the plantation.


	INT. BASEMENT - POINTE DU LAC

	A brick walled storage room. Two coffins stand on the
	floor. Lestat enters with a lantern, Louis behind.
	Lestat is apprehensive and protective of Louis. He
	pulls back one lid ot reveal a satin interior.

				LESTAT
		You must get into it. It's the only
		safe place for you when the light
		comes.

				LOUIS
		And if I don't?

				LESTAT
		The sun will destroy the blood I've
		given you. Every tissue, every
		vein. The fire in this lantern
		could do that too.

	Louis approaches the coffin, hands trembling as he
	peers into it.

				LESTAT
		Don't be afraid. In moments you'll
		be sleeping as soundly as you ever
		slept. And when you awake I'll be
		waiting for you, and so will all
		the world.

	Louis crawls into the coffin, fearful yet fascinated.

				LOUIS
		You told me something earlier. You
		said you didn't have a choice. Was
		that true?

	Lestat smiles bitterly and nods.

				LESTAT
		Someday I'll tell you. We have a
		lot of time to talk to each other.
		You might say... we have all the
		time we shall ever need.

	He closes the lid.

	Total darkness. Sounds of Louis' panicked breathing. Of
	his prayer again.

				LOUIS
		Dear God, what have I done?


	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	Louis and Lestat sitting at a sumptuous table, piled
	with uneaten food. Lestat is going through sheafs of
	documents.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I awoke the next evening to a
		different world. And I realized
		there are as profound differences
		between vampires as between human
		beings...

	Lestat, totting up figures on a piece of paper.

				LESTAT
		Your wealth, dear Louis, is
		inestimable. Your income from
		cotton alone will keep us in
		comfort for a century.

	Louis just stares at him.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I sat there staring at him with
		contempt. He had the soul of a
		shopkeeper, he was the sow's ear
		out of which nothing fine could be
		made. I felt sadly cheated in
		having him as a teacher...

	Lestat looks up at him and grins.

				LESTAT
		You'll get used to killing. Just
		forget about that mortal coil.
		You'll become accustomed to things
		all too quickly.

				LOUIS
		Do you think so?

	Yvette enters, stands behind him, staring at Lestat
	with loathing.

				YVETTE
		You are not hungry, sir...

				LESTAT
		Au contraire, my dear. He could eat
		a horse...

	Lestat laughs loudly. Louis turns and looks at Yvette.
	Her beautiful forehead in the candlelight, the veins
	pulsing on her neck and her hands.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I looked at anything mortal and saw
		all life as precious, condemning
		all fruitless guilt and passion
		that would let it slip through the
		fingers like sand...

	Yvette returns his stare, troubled.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		It was only as a vampire that I
		could see Yvette's beauty. Her fear
		of me increased my desire.

	Yvette reaches for his uneaten plate. Louis stops her
	hand. Holds it for a beat too long, looking at the
	veins in her wrist.

				LOUIS
		I will finish it, Yvette. Now leave
		us.

	She turns and runs from the table. Lestat leans towards
	him.

				LESTAT
		Can't you pretend, you fool? Don't
		give the game away. We're lucky to
		have such a home.

	His hand snakes out under the table. It comes up
	holding a large grey rat.

				LESTAT
		Pretend to drink, at least.

	He bares his fangs and slices the rat's throat. He
	pours the blood into a crystal glass.

				LESTAT
		Such fine crystal shouldn't go to
		waste...

	He hands the glass to Louis. Louis drinks the blood and
	stares at it in surprise, then at the dead rat on the
	fine lace tablecloth.

				LESTAT
		I know. It gets cold so fast.

				LOUIS
		We can live like this? Off the
		blood of animals?

	Lestat shrugs.

				LESTAT
		I wouldn't call it living. I'd call
		it surviving. A useful trick if
		you're caught for a month on a ship
		at sea.

	Lestat strokes the belly of the dead rat, studying it
	sadly.

				LESTAT
		There's nothing in the world now
		that doesn't hold some...

				LOUIS
		Fascination...

				LESTAT
		Yes. And I'm bored with this
		prattle -

	He throws the rat away.

				LOUIS
		But we can live without taking
		human life. It's possible.

				LESTAT
		Anything is possible. But just try
		it for a week. Come into New
		Orleans and let me show you some
		real sport!

	He rises. Louis follows.


	EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

	A big, lavish drinking place with a raised stage.

	Italian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude
	commedia dell'arte on the stage.

	Plantation owners in soiled brocade, lace, crooked wigs
	watch the show as tavern wenches move about.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		This was New Orleans, a magical and
		magnificent place to live. In which
		a vampire, richly dressed might
		attract no more notice in the
		evening than hundreds of other
		exotic creatures.

	Louis and Lestat by a table, in the shadow of a tree.
	Teresa, a tavern wench, sits on Lestat's lap, pouring
	drinks for the two of them. She lifts a fresh glass to
	Lestat's lips as he flirts with her.

				TERESA
		Come on, mon cher. The best in the
		colony. Once you touch this you'll
		never go to any other tavern again.

				LESTAT
		You think so, cherie? But what if
		I'd rather taste your lips?

				TERESA
		My lips are even sweeter still...

	She kisses him. He lets his tongue play with hers, then
	runs it down her neck. She swoons with pleasure. Then
	he sinks his teeth gently in her neck, looking
	playfully behind at Louis, who if appalled and
	fascinated.


	ANTICS ON THE STAGE

	Laughter rocks the tavern.

	Lestat slips the pale and dead Teresa into a chair
	beside him and folds her hands on the table. No one
	notices. He lays gold coins on the table and touches
	Louis' knee.

				LESTAT
		Let's get out of here!

	Lestat rushes out, thrilled with himself.


	EXT. TAVERN - NIGHT

	A crowded street. Louis and Lestat emerge from the
	tavern. Louis looks up at the moon.

				LOUIS
		Have you ever been caught?

				LESTAT
		Of course not. It's so easy you
		almost feel sorry for them.

	They walk down the crowded night street, full of ladies
	in their finery, freed slaves, whores, sailors etc.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Lestat killed two, sometimes three
		a night. A fresh young girl, that
		was his favorite for the first of
		the evening.


	INT. FRENCH QUARTER MANSION - BALLROOM

	Small orchestra plays for colonial couples in fine wig
	and garb prancing to a French minuet. Young women sit
	in chairs along the walls with their chaperones. Young
	men stand opposite.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		But the triumphant kill of Lestat
		was a young man. They represented
		the greatest loss to Lestat because
		they stood on the threshold of the
		maximum possibility of life.

	A youth of preternatural beauty, silhouetted against
	French windows. He is talking to an elegant widow,
	seated, holding two manicured poodles. Lestat stares at
	the youth with longing.

				LESTAT
		The trick is not to think about it.
		See that one? The widow St. Clair?
		she had that gorgeous young fop
		murder her husband. She's perfect
		for you. Go ahead.

				LOUIS
		But how do you know?

				LESTAT
		Read her thoughts.

				LOUIS
		I can't.

				LESTAT
		The dark gift is different for each
		of us. But one thing is true of
		everyone. We grow stronger as we go
		along.

	He leads Louis closer to them.

				LESTAT
		Take my word for it. She blamed a
		slave for his murder. And do you
		know what they did to him?

	He smiles at the young man, who smiles in return.

				LESTAT
		The evildoers are easier. And they
		taste better...


	EXT. LAWNS - NIGHT

	Lestat walks the youth towards a copse of trees. He
	looks back at Louis, who holds both poodles on a
	delicate leash, walking with the widow. The minuet
	spills from the french windows.

				WIDOW ST. CLAIR
		Now, young man, you really amaze
		me! I'm old enough to be your
		grandmother.

	She leans towards him concquettishly. Louis, crazed
	with hunger, sees her as beautiful in the moonlight. He
	allows her lips reach his. He takes her in his arms,
	gently, romantically, and sinks in his teeth. She
	swoons.

				WIDOW ST. CLAIR
		Yes, that's the melody, I remember
		it. Oh yes...

	Louis draws his lips away. She is weak in his arms, but
	still alive. He can't do it. The poodles growl. He
	shoots out an arm and grabs one, then the other.


	EXT. TREES - NIGHT

	Lestat, bending over the body of the dead youth. A
	scream pierces the night.

				WIDOW ST CLAIR
		Murder!!! Murderer!!


	EXT. LAWNS. NIGHT

	The widow on the grass, her poodles dead beside her.
	Louis is trying to quiet her.

				WIDOW ST CLAIR
		My little papillions! My
		butterflies!!! He killed them!!!

	Lestat comes from nowhere, claps a hand over her mouth
	and breaks her neck. He spits in fury at Louis.

				LESTAT
		You whining coward of a vampire who
		prowls the night killing rats and
		poodles. You could have finished us
		both!
		
	Louis throws himself on Lestat with extraordinary
	force, pummeling him towards the trees.

				LOUIS
		What have you done to me? You've
		condemned me to hell.

				LESTAT
		I don't know any hell -

	Louis hurls him against tree after tree with a strength
	he never knew he had.

				LOUIS
		You want to see me kill? Watch me
		kill you then -

	He drags him to the ground an throttles him. Lestat
	looks up at him, amazed and amused at the same time.

				LESTAT
		What strength, my friend, what
		strength. I remember why I chose
		you now.

	Lestat squirms from his grip, seemingly effortlessly.

				LESTAT
		But you can't kill me, Louis. Nor I
		you.

	He ruffles Louis' hair, with wry affection.

				LESTAT
		Feed on what you want, mon cherie.
		Rats, chickens, doves, goats. I'll
		leave you to it and watch you come
		round. Just remember, life without
		me would be even more unbearable...

	He smiles. A sly, pleasurable secret secret smile.


	EXT. POINTE DU LAC - NIGHT

	Their carriage draws up to the mansion as the first
	fingers of light spread across the sky.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Being a vampire to him meant
		revenge. Revenge against life-
		itself. Every time he took a life
		it was revenge. and the slaves with
		a wisdom that was denied their
		masters, began to notice...


	INT. SLAVE-HUT - NIGHT

	In a tiny cabin, a slave family. Kids sleeping on the
	floor, in cribs and cots. The parents sleep on the bed,
	young, beautiful, naked. Beside them is Lestat, who is
	drinking the husband's blood, his hand playing across
	the breast of the wife as he does so. She murmurs in
	her sleep.

				WIFE
		Yes... please...

	She grabs his fingers and kisses them, thinking him to
	be her husband. Lestat gently disengages himself and
	leaves.


	EXT. SLAVE-HUT - NIGHT

	The woman's scream pierces the sky, as Lestat walks
	into the night.


	EXT. CHICKEN-COOP - NIGHT

	Every chicken is dead, bloodies necks hanging down from
	the cribs. Louis emerges from the entrance, blood on
	his lips. He hears the scream.


	EXT. SLAVE QUARTER - NIGHT

	The sound of drumming is heard, African, primal. The
	woman runs through the quarters, screaming grief.
	Others gather at doorways, restrain and console her.


	EXT. DOVE-COTE - DAY

	A beautiful, elaborate eighteenth century dove-cote.
	Every dove inside is dead, pierced at the neck. A black
	hand throws in a flaming torch and it bursts into
	flame.


	INT. CABIN - NIGHT

	A doll, made in the image of Lestat, is pierced with
	needles.


	EXT. SWAMP BY FIELDS - DAY

	Bodies of slaves floating in the swamp, with the bodies
	of goats. Slaves at the edge throw ropes around the
	bodies, pull them towards the shore. The drumming grows
	louder.


	EXT. SLAVE-QUARTERS - NIGHT

	Louis walking through. The slaves hush as he
	approaches, gather in doorways and whisper. He turns
	and looks at them, sorrowfully. He looks truly like a
	ghost. Their eyes turn away when they meet his. He
	walks on.


	INT. DINING ROOM IN MANSION - NIGHT

	Lestat and Louis sit at the table, the untouched food
	between them.

				LESTAT
		Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a
		vampire has to be clever for many
		reasons. Here all one needs is a
		pair of fangs.

				LOUIS
		Paris? You came from Paris?

				LESTAT
		As did the one who made me.

				LOUIS
		Tell me about him. You must have
		learnt something from him! It had
		to happen for you as it did for me!

				LESTAT
		I learnt absolutely nothing. I
		wasn't give a choice, remember?

				LOUIS
		But you must know something about
		the meaning of it all, you must
		know where we come from, why we...

	Lestat spits out in anger.

				LESTAT
		Why? Why should I know these
		things? Do you know them?

	The drumming grows outside.

				LESTAT
			(gripping his temples)
		That noise! It's driving me mad!
		We've been in the country for
		weeks, with nothing but that
		noise!!!

				LOUIS
		They know about us. They see us
		dine on empty plates and drink from
		empty glasses.

				LESTAT
		Come the New Orleans then. There's
		an opera on tonight. A real french
		opera! We can dine in splendor!

				LOUIS
		I respect life, don't you see? For
		each and every human life I have
		respect.

				LESTAT
		Respect me a little then. I'm the
		only life you know.

	Louis stares. Lestat turns childishly, petulantly.

				LESTAT
		You'll soon run out of chickens,
		Louis...

	He walks out, humming a French aria. Louis stares at
	his plate.


	EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

	The slaves, gathered on mass around fires. Frenzied
	drumming, dancing. Lestat rides through, scattering the
	flames. The drumming stops. The slaves look towards the
	house. Slowly, they begin to move towards it.


	INT. POINTE DU LAC DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	Louis, sitting in despair by the table. Yvette, the
	slave girl enters.

				YVETTE
		Michi Louis? You don't want any
		supper?

	Louis laughs harshly.

				LOUIS
		No, ma cher. I need no supper. Is
		all well at Pointe Du Lac tonight?

	Yvette draws closer. Light reveals her beauty.

				YVETTE
		We worry about you master. When do
		you ride about the fields? How long
		since you've been to the slave
		quarters? Everywhere there is
		death. Animals, men. Are you our
		master still at all?

	Louis watches her sadly. He's getting hungry. Her
	throat is long and slender, her breasts are gorgeous.

				LOUIS
			(dazed)
		Leave me alone now, Yvette.

				YVETTE
		I will not go unless you listen to
		me. Send away this new friend of
		yours. The slaves are frightened of
		him. They are frightened of you.

	She comes closer, and he can hear her beating heart.
	She touches his hair. He takes her hand and brings it
	to his lips.

				LOUIS
		I am frightened of myself, Yvette.

	He kisses her wrist. She suddenly gasps, sharply,
	withdraws her hand. She sees her wrist is red with
	blood. She sees the blood on his lips. She screams.

	Louis stands.

				LOUIS
		Hush, Yvette -

	She screams even louder. Louis clamps his hand over her
	mouth. Her hand grips the table-cloth, pulls, bringing
	the empty glasses and crockery to the floor.

	In horror, Louis realizes he has broken her neck. He
	brings her cut wrist to his lips, then drops it,
	revolted. He carries her body outside, grief-stricken.

	The drumming grows louder.


	EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

	Fires burning in the distance, round the slave-cabins.
	The slaves are gathered at the foot of the mansion
	steps. They see Louis come out, holding the body of
	Yvette. He is deranged with grief.

				LOUIS
		This place is cursed. Damned, do
		you hear me? And your master is the
		devil.

	He places the body of Yvette in a rocking chair on the
	veranda.

				LOUIS
		Get out while you can. You're free
		men.

	They don't move. They stare at him blankly.

				LOUIS
		Unlike me, you are no free men...

	He turns behind him, and looks at the mansion, all
	candelabra and chandeliers lighted, all windows open.

				LOUIS
		Do I have to convince you?

	He rushed up the stairs, snatches up the candelabra and
	sets fire to the drapes. He goes from window to window,
	lighting drapes, lace curtains, everything.


	SLAVES POV - MASTER

	Setting fire to the house.

	They rush up the stairs with shouts of "STOP HIM, HE'S
	MAD". A wall of flame gushes out from the interior,
	blocking their way.


	INT. BURNING MANSION - NIGHT

	Louis, wandering from room to room of the burning
	mansion. he sees paintings of his wife consumed by the
	flames. He is weakening with the fumes, the heat. We
	can see this in his face, the texture of his skin.

	Suddenly a large french window cascades inwards and
	Lestat stands there, whip in hand. Behind him we can
	see the morning sky.

				LESTAT
		You fool, what have you done?

				LOUIS
		What you wouldn't do. It's almost
		sunrise. It will be the sun or the
		fire. You said they can kill me.
		The sun or the fire!

	Louis stands there, weakened, then collapses onto the
	floor. Lestat darts forward and catches him before he
	drops. He runs out the shattered window, carrying him
	on his shoulder.


	EXT. LARGE GRAVEYARD - DAWN

	With many crypts. Louis, unconscious, carried over
	Lestat's shoulder.


	INT. CRYPT

	Darkness. Louis lying on the floor of a large crypt. He
	slowly comes to.

				LOUIS
		Where are we?

				LESTAT
		Where do you think, my idiot
		friend? We're in a nice filthy
		cemetery. Does this make you happy?
		Is this fitting and proper enough?

	Louis laughs softly.

				LOUIS
		We belong in hell.

				LESTAT
		And what if there is no hell, or
		they don't want us there? Ever
		think of that?


	INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

	The vampire sits in silence, as if tired by his story.
	Malloy speaks, hesitantly.

				MALLOY
		You loved Yvette...

				LOUIS
		Can a vampire feel love?

				MALLOY
		You loved your wife, surely.

				LOUIS
		I was human then. Might as well ask
		can an angel feel love. Both are
		blesses or cursed with a certain...
		detachment. Though whether angels
		take as long to learn it as I, I
		will never know.

	He looks directly at Malloy, shocking him with his
	gaze.

				LOUIS
		Yes, I loved Yvette. As I loved
		Pointe Du Lac. And as with each
		thing I loved, I destroyed it.


	EXT. NEW ORLEANS - EVENING

	From the sea, at evening, shrouded in mist.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Lestat I did not love. And he
		survived.


	INT. INN - EVENING

	A lavish little supper chamber with coffered bed, fancy
	French furniture. Open to rooftops of colonial city.
	Louis sits by an open window looking out over the city.
	Behind, we can hear the laughter of Lestat and tow
	female voices. Louis turns and sees -

	Lestat, in the main chamber with two drugged or drunked
	whores. One runs her finger down his chest. The other
	seems out of it.

				WHORE #1
		You're skin's icy.

				LESTAT
		Not always...

	He presses his thumb on her neck and holds her tight,
	sinking his teeth into her neck. After a time she falls
	to the bed, dead. he turns to the other.

				LESTAT
		Your friend has no head for wine.

				WHORE
		She's stupid. I can warm that cold
		skin of yours better than she can.

				LESTAT
		Do you think so?

	He rubs her breast.

				WHORE
		Why you're warm now.

				LESTAT
		Ah, but the price is pretty high.
		Your sweet friend - I exhausted
		her.

	He bites her in turn, drinks her blood. She does into
	the swoon.

	Louis looks on in disgust. He stands.

				LOUIS
		I'm leaving you. I can't stand this
		any longer.

	Lestat pulls away from the whore.

				LESTAT
		What, no flowery speeches? About
		what a monster I am? What a vulgar
		fiend?

				LOUIS
		I'm not interested in you. You
		disgust me. I'm interested in my
		own nature and know I can't trust
		you to tell me the truth about me.

				LESTAT
		What do you imagine you are Louis?

				LOUIS
		I don't pretend to know.

				LESTAT
		Don't you understand, Louis, that
		you alone of all creatures can see
		death with impunity... you alone
		under the rising moon can strike
		like the hand of God.

	The girl moans.

				LOUIS
		Lestat, she's alive!!!

				LESTAT
		Vampires are killers. Predators,
		who's all seeing eyes were meant to
		give them detachment.

	The girl moans again, open her eyes.

				LOUIS
		The girl, Lestat -

				LESTAT
		I know. Let her alone.

	He slashes her wrist with his teeth, and lets the blood
	drip into a glass.

				LESTAT
		You think you can be human. You
		think you can go back. But you
		can't. You live off the blood of
		rats now Louis. How human is that?

	The girls moans again. Lestat drinks that glass.

				LESTAT
		Lie still, love...

	The girl begins to scream. Lestat picks her up.

				LESTAT
		You're tired love, you want to
		sleep.

	He walks to his coffin, puts her inside and sits on the
	lid. We hear muffled screaming and banging from inside.

				LOUIS
		Why do you do this Lestat?

				LESTAT
		I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take
		you aesthete's taste to purer
		things. Kill them swiftly if you
		will, but do it! For now doubt, you
		are a killer Louis. Ah!

	He stands up. The girl pushes the lid off, hysterical.
	She looks at Louis.

				GIRL
		It's a coffin, a coffin! Get me
		out!

				LESTAT
		Of course it's a coffin. You're
		dead, love.

	Louis screams at Lestat

				LOUIS
		Lestat - finish this -

				LESTAT
		You finish her - if you feel so
		much -

	The girl grabs Louis and pleads.

				GIRL
		You won't let me die, will you?
		You'll save me?

				LESTAT
		But it's too late, love. Look at
		your wrist, you breast.

	He picks her up again. He turns to Louis laughing.

				LESTAT
		Unless I make her one of us...

				LOUIS
		NO!!!

				LESTAT
		THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!

	The girl screams. Louis puts his hands to his ears.
	Then Lestat, in a fit of pique puts his teeth to her
	neck. She dies at last.

	A terrible silence descends. Lestat looks at Louis.

				LOUIS
		My God... to think you... are all I
		have to learn from...

				LESTAT
		In the old world, they called it
		the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it
		to you.

	Louis leaves without a word.


	EXT. DANK NEW ORLEANS BACK STREETS - NIGHT

	A rat scurried down a gutter, then another and another.
	Louis' hand grabs the rat. We see him from behind,
	walking down the street, gripping one, then another.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Am I damned? Am I from the devil?
		Is my very nature that of a devil?
		And all the while, as these dreaded
		questions caused me to neglect my
		thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my
		veins were threads of pain in my
		flesh, my temples throbbed.

	A smaller side street, in which every house is marked
	with an X. The street is crawling with rats, and Louis
	is following them. A man passes with a lantern.

				MAN
		Don't go that way Monsieur. It's
		the plague. Go back the way you
		came.

	Louis smiles bitterly at these words, repeating them to
	himself.

				LOUIS
		The way I came...

	He walks on, following the rats.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		... and finally, when I could stand
		it no longer, I stood in an empty
		desolate street and heard the sound
		of a child crying.

	A house, the door slightly open, marked with an X. The
	sound of a child crying inside. Louis walks towards it.


	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	A little girl, pulling at a figure in a rocking chair.

				CLAUDIA
		Mama, please wake up. Mama, I'm
		frightened, please wake up.

	As Louis enters, he sees the woman is dead. Her eyes
	are being eaten away by rats.

	Louis gasps in horror. Claudia turns. She is a radiant
	doll or angel as she stretches out her hand to Louis.

				CLAUDIA
		Monsieur, please help us. Papa's
		waiting for us at the ship. Please
		wake mama, Monsieur.

	She runs to him. Instinctively, he gathers her in his
	arms. He looks down pitying on her beautiful face.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		And if I am damned, why do I fell
		such pity for her gaunt face? Why
		do I wish to warm her tiny arms?
		Comfort her beating heart?

	She snuggles into him, suddenly utterly secure. She
	tugs at his hair, brings his head down towards her. And
	we see Louis shiver, as his lips go to her neck.

	Her breathing becomes calm as she goes into the swoon.
	Gradually another sound replaces it.

	LESTAT'S LAUGHTER, GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER.

	Suddenly Louis backs away, caught red-handed, the child
	in his arms. He sees Lestat slapping his knee and
	laughing in the doorway.

				LESTAT
		Ah, my philosopher, my martyr.
		"Never take a human life". Well you
		must admit it is funny. Or is it
		merely touching? I'm not sure.

	Louis stares at the unconscious Claudia in horror, then
	lets her slip gently into a chair. Shamefully he wipes
	his mouth, sees the tiny wounds on her throat.

	Lestat snatches up the dead mother from the chair and
	begins to dance with her in great circles, humming and
	talking. Her head falls back. Black water flows from
	her mouth.

				LESTAT
		Let's make some party of it, shall
		we? Maybe there's some life in the
		old lady yet?

	Louis flees into the street.

				LESTAT
		Come back, Louis, you are what you
		are. The plague would have got her
		within hours anyway. Merciful Death
		how you love your precious guilt.


	EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

	Louis running through an assortment of streets. All the
	night life of New Orleans flows by him.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		For years I had not savored a
		human. And when I had Lestat's
		words made sense to me. I knew
		peace only when I killed and when I
		heard her heart in that terrible
		rhythm I knew again what peace
		could be. Yet even then I could not
		contenance it...


	EXT. WATERFRONT - DAWN

	Fingers of light in the sky. Louis, pale and shivering,
	walks splashing through the water. He comes to a huge
	sewer-pipe, crowded with rats. He crawls inside.


	EXT. WATERFRONT - SOME EVENINGS LATER

	The same sewer-pipe. Now the bodies of dead rats lie
	all around. A pair of fine leather boots splash through
	the water - Lestat's.


	INT. SEWER-PIPE - EVENING

	Louis huddled there, so pale and shivering he seems
	close to death. Lestat comes through.

				LESTAT
		All I need to find you Louis is
		follow the corpses of rats.

	He bends down to him, surprisingly gently and puts his
	own coat around him.

				LESTAT
		Pain is terrible for you. You feel
		it like no other creature because
		you are a vampire. You don't want
		it to go on.

				LOUIS
		No...

	They emerge from the sewer and walk along the
	waterfront.

				LESTAT
		Do what it is in your nature to do.
		And you will feel as you felt with
		that child in your arms.

				LOUIS
		Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt
		an end to the craving.

				LESTAT
		That and more.

	He puts his arm around Louis, to stop his shivering.

				LESTAT
		Evil is a point of view. God kills,
		indiscriminately, and so shall we.
		For no creatures under God are as
		we are, none so like him as
		ourselves.

				LOUIS
		Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?

				LESTAT
		Ah, but we have even more in common
		with our creator. come, I am like a
		mother tonight. I want a child.

	Louis is baffled. He follows.


	INT. INN - SUPPER ROOM

	Lestat enters.

				LESTAT
		She's here, your wounded one.

				LOUIS
		What are you saying?

				LESTAT
		You need company, Louis. More
		congenial than mine...

	Lestat holds up a candle and walks towards a large four-
	poster bed. Claudia lies there, angelic, under the
	coverlet, two marks on her neck.

				LOUIS
		Lestat!

				LESTAT
		You remember how you wanted her,
		the taste of her -

				LOUIS
		I didn't want to kill her.

				LESTAT
		Don't worry, Louis, you're
		conscience is clear. You left her
		alive.

	Lestat shakes her gently.

				LESTAT
		Claudia, Claudia, listen to me.
		You're ill, my precious and I'm
		going to give you what you need to
		get well.

				LOUIS
		Lestat, what do you mean?

	Louis runs at him, but Lestat brushes him aside
	effortlessly, so he falls to the floor. Lestat bites
	his wrist and presses the bleeding wound to the child's
	mouth... He winces in pain.

				LESTAT
		That's it dear. More. You must
		drink it to get well.

	Claudia sucks on the wound, reviving, making little
	noises like a person waking from sleep.

	Louis rises to his feet as Claudia clutches Lestat's
	arm, sucking the blood fiercely. Lestat moans.

				LESTAT
		Stop, that's enough. No more.

	He pulls her loose and she growls and stares at him
	with big clear astonished eyes.

				CLAUDIA
		I want more.

				LOUIS
		What have you done?

	Lestat puts her down on the bed and sits beside her,
	holding his wrist, obviously in pain.

				CLAUDIA
		More.

				LESTAT
		Yes, cherie, of course you want
		more. And I'll show you how to get
		it. You drink from morals, my
		beauty, but from me? Never again.

	Still suffering, Lestat pulls the bell-rope.


	CLOSE ON CLAUDIA

	Being transformed. Becoming white yet robust, bright-
	eyed yet crazed. She shakes her beautiful curls and the
	dust falls from them. They are shining in the
	candlelight.

	Louis cannot stop looking at her. He does not notices
	as -

	The MAID enters.

				MAID
		Ah, quelle Belle enfant!

	The maid comes near the bed, kneels in front of
	Claudia. Lestat lays his hand on the maid's throat and
	Claudia watches keenly.

				LESTAT
		Gently, cherie. They are so
		innocent. They must not be made to
		suffer.

	Claudia lunges for the throbbing vein in the neck,
	locking on to the flowing blood.

	The Maid is transfixed.

	Close on Louis, his anguish, his fascinated horror.

				LOUIS
		You are the devil! You are the
		instrument of Satan!

				LESTAT
		That's enough, cherie. Stop before
		the heart stops.

	He lets the dead maid onto the floor. Claudia looks at
	the corpse.

				CLAUDIA
		I want some more.

				LESTAT
		It's bet in the beginning, lest the
		death takes you down with it. yes,
		that's it. My child. My beloved
		child.

	Lestat and Claudia sit on the Louis XVI settee. Claudia
	is a vision, a doll made out of pearl. Animated, voice
	crisp.

				CLAUDIA
		Where is Mamma?

	The words echo in Louis' head, as he puts his hands to
	his ears.

				LESTAT
		Mamma's gone to Heaven, cherie,
		like that sweet lady over there.
		They all go to Heaven. And you did
		very well, cherie. Not a drop
		spilt. Very good! You're going to
		be our child now.

	Lestat takes out his comb and begins to comb her hair.

				LESTAT
		Your mama's left you with us. She
		wants you to be happy.

				LOUIS
			(whispers)
		You are the devil! You are the
		instrument of Satan!

				LESTAT
		Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our
		little daughter?

				CLAUDIA
		I'm not your daughter.

				LESTAT
		Yes you are, my dearest. You are
		mine and Louis' daughter. You see
		Louis was going to leave us. He was
		going to go away. But now he's not.
		He's going to stay and make you
		happy.

	Claudia runs over to him. She smiles at him.

				CLAUDIA
		Lou...eee...

	Louis is conflicted. He cannot leave her. He touches
	her cheeks, her hair. Same as his. Vampire skin and
	hair. He draws in his breath, shocked by her beauty,
	then he embraces her as a father might a daughter. He
	looks over her shoulder to Lestat.

				LOUIS
		You fiend. You monster.

	Lestat smiles

				LESTAT
		One happy family.


	INT. ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO

	Malloy is open mouthed.

				MALLOY
		A child vampire!

	He sees the tape has run out. He rapidly and clumsily
	sticks in another.

				LOUIS
		Shall we go on?

				MALLOY
		He did it to make you stay with
		him!

				LOUIS
		Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I
		would love her more than the waking
		world. But there was more to it
		than that. Perhaps in the end he
		did it - to show me that he could.
		For he lavished affection on her,
		there was no doubt about that. Life
		was very different with madame
		Claudia, as you can imagine...


	EXT. NEW SPANISH TOWNHOUSE - (RUE ROYALE, NEW ORLEANS)

	Two husky movers bring in furniture through the back
	courtyard, past the fountain and the banana trees, up
	the back stairs and into -


	INT. FLAT

	Striped wallpaper gives way to flowers in the bedrooms.
	Huge four-poster beds in the bedrooms, and large
	chests, as big as coffins standing against the wall.
	Everywhere there are candles and pretty Louis XVI
	furniture. Lestat gives instructions to the movers.


	WE MOVE INTO A DIMLY LIT PARLOUR

	We see Claudia draped in lace standing on a petit point
	chair as a DRESSMAKER measure out a garment.

	Louis can be seen, in an inner room.

				DRESSMAKER
		Monsieur, I need more light. I
		shall go slind if you do not bring
		me a lamp, or let me fit this child
		during the day. Ouch!

	She has pricked her hand. A spot of blood appears on
	her finger Claudia takes her hand.

				CLAUDIA
		Let me kiss it better...

	Claudia brings the hand to her lips. The dressmaker
	abruptly pulls her finger away, in pain again.

	CLOSEUP - her finger, two holes showing.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		A little child she was, but also a
		fierce killer, now capable of the
		ruthless pursuit of blood with all
		a child's demanding.

	Lestat walks through - sees the dressmaker lying dead
	at Claudia's feet, Claudia still on the chair in the
	half-finished dress.

				LESTAT
		Claudia, Claudia, will you never
		learn? Who will we get now to
		finish your dress? A little
		practicality, cherie...


	INT. LOUIS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		She would sleep in my coffin,
		daily, curl her child's fingers
		round my hair as she dreamt of I
		know not what...
		
	Claudia and Louis, sleeping in a coffin together,
	Claudia's fingers curling his hair.


	INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM

	Claudia playing with dolls, each as perfect and
	beautifully dressed as she is.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Mute and beautiful, she played with
		dolls, dressing them and undressing
		them by the hour.


	INT. PARLOUR - NIGHT

	Claudia tinkling with her child's hands on the piano,
	picking out a hesitant tune.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Mute and beautiful, she killed. And
		to watch her kill was chilling.


	EXT. SQUARE - NIGHT

	The tinkling of Claudia's piano is heard, over -

	A well-dressed lady, walking through a square lit by
	gaslight. The lady hears a child's sobbing and stops,
	turns.


	POV

	Claudia, the picture of lost innocence, sitting on a
	bench and crying.

				WOMAN
		Why are you crying, child?

	The woman, all solicitude, goes to Claudia.

				WOMAN
		Are you lost, my love?

				CLAUDIA
		Mama...

				WOMAN
		Hush now, don't cry, We'll find
		her...

				CLAUDIA
		Mama...

	The woman takes Claudia in her arms. Claudia nestles
	her head in her shoulder, her teeth near her neck.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		They found death fast in those
		days, before she learnt to play
		with the, to delay the moment till
		she had taken what she wanted...


	INT. PARLOUR - NIGHT

	A stern, stiff PIANO-TEACHER (male) beating time with a
	ruler as Claudia picks out scales on the piano. He raps
	her on the knuckles.

				PIANO-TEACHER
		The thumb girl! Mind the thumb!

	Claudia glares at him, then returns to playing,
	improving rapidly.


	INT. DOLL-SHOP - NIGHT

	Piano music over. Mozart, now well played.

	Claudia staring at a glass case, inside of which are an
	array of eighteenth century dolls. An old DOLLMAKER
	looks down on her.

				DOLLMAKER
		They are expensive, my dear. Maybe
		too expensive for a young girl like
		you...


	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Claudia walking along, clutching the doll.


	INT. DOLL-SHOP - NIGHT

	The dollmaker lying dead, two puncture marks in his
	throat, his dolls scattered all around him.


	EXT. UNDERTAKER'S - NIGHT

	Claudia and Louis looking through the window at a
	display of coffins. Claudia point at the smallest one.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		She grew, yet stayed the same. She
		wanted a bed of her own, yet would
		climb back into mine.


	INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The child's coffin on the floor. The lid lifts. Claudia
	emerges, yawning, wanders through the flat into -


	LOUIS' BEDROOM

	Where his coffin sits. She slides the lid off, and
	curls in beside him.


	INT. PARLOUR - NIGHT

	Claudia playing the piano, now with remarkable
	dexterity. The piano-teacher sits mute beside her. As
	she plays, he topples over and falls to the ground. We
	see the puncture-marks in his neck. Lestat, hearing the
	noise, comes in.

				LESTAT
		Claudia, Claudia! Didn't I tell
		you, never in the house!

	Claudia smiles to herself, keeps playing.


	INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	CANARIES sing in a cage, above a child's coffin.

	Claudia is writing at a secretaire. She is writing in a
	diary with a quill pen in an adult hand. She murmurs
	the date as she writes.

				CLAUDIA
		September 21st, one hour after
		sunset. The sky is still violet,
		the way Louis loves and as always
		Lestat was gone when we rose.

	She looks up and sees Louis in the doorway, watching
	her.

				LOUIS
		How did you learn to write,
		Claudia?

				CLAUDIA
		The way I learn everything. By
		watching you.

	She closes the diary.

				CLAUDIA
		But you never let me see you kill,
		Louis.

				LOUIS
		Lestat taught you all you need to
		know about that.

				CLAUDIA
		Infant death, he calls me. Sweet
		daughter death. You know what he
		calls you? Merciful death.

				LOUIS
		He jests.

				CLAUDIA
		Why does he call you that?

				LOUIS
		Hush, Claudia don't talk about such
		things. Show me your book.

	She opens it. Inside there is a beautiful pen and ink
	portrait of Louis.

				LOUIS
		Claudia! You did that?

				CLAUDIA
		Sit still. It's not finished -

	She begins to fill in the sketch.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Time can pass fast for mortals when
		they're happy. With us it was the
		same.


	EXT. RUE ROYALE - NIGHT (1800'S)

	Street lamps are oil at this period. Houses are now
	tall two-story Spanish style. Streets are flagstone.
	Passing carriages are black.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		It was a very different life. And a
		new century was beginning. what had
		once been a small godforsaken
		French colony was growing into a
		great port, giving us an endless
		train of magnificent strangers...

	Claudia, Louis and Lestat, dressed in the same clothes
	walking through a raucous carnival with sideshows.
	Crowd milling around, sailors, whores, children,
	thieves, freed slaves, Indians. They pass a Wild West
	display, jugglers, fire-eaters, three-card
	tricksters...

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		All human life was here, for the
		taking. And we took, all three of
		us, in our different ways...

	They come to a raised platform where a troupe of
	perfectly-formed midgets do a burlesque show.

	Claudia stops. She stares, at these small, perfect
	creatures like herself, intrigued and troubled.

	Louis and Lestat walk on, not noticing as -


	CLAUDIA

	Circles the troupe. She comes to a small tent, behind
	it. At the entrance stands a midget youth.

				YOUTH
		You want to come inside, lovely?

	Claudia walks up to him.

				YOUTH
		Ever been kissed?

	Claudia shakes her head. He kisses her. Claudia allow
	her to be kissed, then bites his tongue. he youth
	struggles, as Claudia holds him and drains him. She
	lets him go as Louis appears behind her.

				CLAUDIA
		She's like me, Louis. Small and yet
		not small at all. Like me.

	Louis hurriedly draws her away.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I watched her grow yet stay the
		same, her doll-like face possessed
		of adult eyes, eerie, powerful,
		seductive...


	INT. FLAT - NIGHT

	Claudia playing the piano, now like a demonic Liszt.
	Louis writing.

	Lestat appears in the doorway. He has a big box in his
	arms.

				CLAUDIA
		Another doll? I have ten, you
		realize.

	FOCUS ON early 19th Century French dolls - wood, glass,
	wax, bisque - all around the bedroom, on chairs, on the
	bed. Some newish, some tattered old.

				LESTAT
		Well, I thought you could use
		another.

	He hands her the box. It is a fine Parisian Jumeau
	doll. She likes it and stokes its face.

				CLAUDIA
		Why always on this night?

				LESTAT
		What night? What do you mean?

				CLAUDIA
		You always give me the doll on the
		same night of the year.

				LESTAT
		I didn't realize.

				CLAUDIA
		Is this my birthday?

	He examines the other dolls.

				LESTAT
		Some of these are so old and
		tattered. You should throw them
		away.

				CLAUDIA
		I have. Or there would be twice as
		many.

				LESTAT
		But you're the fairest by far.

				CLAUDIA
		You dress me like a doll. You make
		my hair like a doll. Why?

	Lestat doesn't answer. Claudia stands up quickly, and
	strides out into the -


	PARLOUR

	Where Louis is reading by the window. She walks to a
	mirrored cabinet, takes out a scissors and begins
	cutting her hair.

				CLAUDIA
		You want me to be a doll forever?

				LOUIS
		Claudia - don't -

				CLAUDIA
		Why not?

	She continues cutting. She sees Lestat emerge from her
	bedroom in the mirror behind her then turns to him, an
	angelic little boy's face now with soft curls around
	her face.

				CLAUDIA
		Can't I change, like everybody
		else?

	She walks past him, back into her bedroom and slams the
	door.

	A beat. Louis looks from the mass of blonde hair on the
	floor to Lestat. Then a HORRID SCREAM pierces the
	silence. More screams, which become roars.


	INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM

	She stands before the dressing-table, all her long hair
	grown back over her shoulders. She holds it with both
	hands, screaming and screaming. Lestat and Louis come
	through the door.

				CLAUDIA
		Which of you did it? Which of you
		made me the way I am?

				LESTAT
		What you are? You would be
		something other than you are?

				CLAUDIA
		And if I cut my hair again?

				LESTAT
		It will grow back again!

				CLAUDIA
		But it wasn't always so! I had a
		mother once! And Louis - he had a
		wife! He was mortal the same as
		she! And so was I!

				LOUIS
		Claudia -

	She turns on Lestat.

				CLAUDIA
		You made us what we are, didn't
		you?

				LESTAT
		Stop her Louis!

				CLAUDIA
		DID YOU DO IT TO ME????

	She runs at him with the scissors, scoring his face.
	The cut heals. She scores it again. It heals again. She
	stares at him in horror.

				CLAUDIA
			(whispering)
		How did you do it?

				LESTAT
		And why should I tell you? It's in
		my power.

				CLAUDIA
		Why yours alone? Tell me how it was
		done!!!!

				LESTAT
		Be glad I made you what you are!
		You'd be dead not if I hadn't.

	He storms out. Louis goes to Claudia and picks her up
	in his arms.

				LOUIS
			(tenderly)
		We're immortal. You've always known
		that.

				CLAUDIA
		Tell me why... you've got to tell
		me...

	Louis carries her outside, onto the porch. There is an
	old flower-seller going by.

				LOUIS
		You see the old woman? That will
		never happen to you. You'll never
		grow old. You will never die.

				CLAUDIA
		And it means something else too,
		doesn't it? I shall never, ever
		grow up.

	She clutches Louis desperately.

				CLAUDIA
		I hate him. But I cannot bear to
		lose you. You're the only companion
		I have, forever. You taught me
		everything I know. Please tell me
		Louis. Tell me how it came to be
		that I am this... thing...

	Louis strokes her beautiful face, her hair.

				LOUIS
		Come... I've something to show
		you...


	EXT. NEW ORLEANS STREETS - NIGHT

	Louis walking, holding Claudia as if he was about to
	lose her.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Though everything was changed,
		through the years had warped the
		contours of the streets, I found my
		way there, aware that I'd always
		known where it was and avoided it,
		not wanting to pass the doorway
		where I'd first heard Claudia cry.

	Louis back in the same street, outside the same house.
	He stands with Claudia at the window. There is a family
	inside, a picture of domestic tranquility.

				LOUIS
		I heard you crying. You were there
		in a room with your mother. You
		were hugging her for warmth, crying
		pitifully as you had been for days.
		Because your mother was dead...

	Claudia stares at him, suddenly very cold, very alert.

				LOUIS
		I opened the shutters... I came
		into the room... I felt pity for
		you. Pity, but something else.

	He can't go on. Claudia's eyes are remorseless.

				CLAUDIA
		You... fed on me?

				LOUIS
		And he found me with you. I ran,
		sickened at what I'd done. Then he
		cut his wrist and fed you from him.
		I tried to stop him, but you were a
		vampire then. And have been every
		night hereafter.

				CLAUDIA
		You both did it?

				LOUIS
		I took your life. He gave you
		another one.

	Claudia speaks through indrawn breath.

				CLAUDIA
		And here it is. And I hate you
		both.

	She runs.


	INT. ROOM SAN FRANCISCO

	Malloy and Louis.

				MALLOY
		But why did you tell her?

				LOUIS
		How could I not? She had to know.

				MALLOY
		And did you lose her? Did she go?

				LOUIS
		Where would she have gone? She was
		a child, and beautiful,
		heartbreaking merciless child. And
		I had made her that...


	EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

	Louis, walking the streets, shivering.

				LOUIS
		I walked all night. I walked as I
		walked years before when my mind
		swam with guilt at the thought of
		killing. I found myself at the
		Cathedral.

	A cathedral rising out of the mist, the doors open.

				LOUIS
		I thought of all the things I had
		done and couldn't undo. And I
		longed for one second's peace...

	Louis walks towards the doors, inside.


	INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

	Louis enters. The dim lights of candles. A sacristan
	tending the altar, an old woman praying - otherwise
	empty.

				LOUIS
		I had no fear. If anything I longed
		for something to happen, for the
		stones to tremble as I entered the
		foyer.

	Louis walking down the nave of the church. He stops by
	the alter.

				LOUIS
		I almost genuflected from old
		habit. I almost prayed.

	Louis sits in a pew.

				LOUIS
		And then it struck me.


	LOUIS' POV

	The cross, the statues, the tabernacle.

				LOUIS
		What if the statues gave an image
		to nothing? What if I was the
		supernatural in this cathedral? The
		only immortal under this roof. And
		I felt nothing but loneliness.
		Loneliness to the point of madness.

	Suddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder. Louis almost
	jumps. He turns and sees the face of a grey-haired
	priest.

				PRIEST
		You wish to go to confession? I was
		about to lock up the church.

	Louis stares at him, tears in his eyes.

				PRIEST
		You are troubled, aren't you? Can I
		help?

				LOUIS
		It's too late, too late -

				PREIST
		No, it's never too late. Come...

	The priest gestures to the confessional. Louis rises,
	slowly.


	INT. CONFESSIONAL

	Louis, kneeling in the darkness. The hatch slides back.

				LOUIS
		Bless me father for I have sinned
		so often and so long, I don't know
		how to change nor beg for
		forgiveness.

				PRIEST
		Son, God is infinite in his
		capacity to forgive. Tell him from
		your heart.

				LOUIS
		Murders, father, death after death.
		The woman who died two nights ago
		in Jackson Square, I killed her.
		And thousands of others before her.
		I have walked the streets of New
		Orleans like the Grim reaper. And
		fed on human life for my own. I am
		a vampire, father, and have turned
		the one I love most of all into on
		too -

	The hatch slams down. Louis rises, confused, and the
	door is flung open, the priest stands there.

				PRIEST
		Do you know the meaning of
		sacrilege?

	Louis rises. Walks out.

				LOUIS
		Then there is no mercy.

	His face comes into the light. The priest steps back,
	open-mouthed.

				LOUIS
		You talk of sacrilege. Why if God
		exists does he suffer me to exist?

	He bares his fangs. The priest runs, screaming. Gets to
	the bellrope, begins to ring the bell. Louis swoops on
	him.

				LOUIS
		Why does he suffer me to live?

	Louis takes him, lifting him from the floor, till his
	feet stop kicking.


	INT. FLAT - NIGHT

	Louis enters, silently, like a corpse. He hears a voice
	behind him.

				CLAUDIA
		Locked together in hatred -

	He turns, sees her sitting in the darkness. She is
	wearing a tiny nightgown of stitched lace and pearls,
	weirdly adult and seductive. She comes towards him.

				CLAUDIA
		But I can't hate you Louis.

	She sprays perfume over her body as she comes nearer.

				CLAUDIA
		Is this the aroma of a mortal
		child?

	She whispers.

				CLAUDIA
		Louis. Lover.

	She kisses his cheek.

				CLAUDIA
		I was mortal to you. You gave me
		your immortal kiss. You became my
		mother and my father. And so I'm
		yours. Forever.

	She takes his face in her hands.

				CLAUDIA
		But now's the time to end it,
		Louis. Now's the time to leave him.

				LOUIS
		He'll never let us go.

	Claudia smiles.

				CLAUDIA
		Oh... really?


	EXT. DOCKLANDS - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

	A sailing ship, by the docks. Louis and Claudia talking
	to a shipping-clerk.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		So we made plans. She was convinced
		there were others of our kind in
		Europe, that they would have the
		answers Lestat couldn't provide.
		Lestat whom she now hated, who she
		thought she could be free of. I
		doubted, but then she had a
		surprise in store...


	INT. FLAT - NIGHT

	Lestat playing the piano. Louis reading. Claudia
	enters, wearing a cape and hat. She walks to the piano,
	sits at the end of the piano and stares at him as he
	plays.

				LESTAT
		What is it now? You irritate me!
		Your very presence irritates me!

				CLAUDIA
			(sweetly)
		Does it?

				LESTAT
		Yes. And I'll tell you something
		else! I've met someone who will
		make a better vampire than both of
		you.

				CLAUDIA
		Is that supposed to frighten me?

				LESTAT
		You're spoilt because you're an
		only child. You need a brother. Or
		I do. I'm weary of you both.

				CLAUDIA
		I suppose we could people the world
		with vampires, the three of us.

				LESTAT
		Not you my dear.

				CLAUDIA
		You're a liar. But you upset my
		plans.

				LESTAT
		What plans?

				CLAUDIA
		I came to make peace with you, even
		if you're the father of lies. I
		want things to be as they were.

	Louis perks up, puzzled.

				LESTAT
		Stop pestering me then!

				CLAUDIA
		Oh, Lestat. I must do more than
		that. I've brought a present for
		you.

				LESTAT
		Then I hope its a beautiful woman
		with endowments you will never
		possess.

	Claudia stares at him for a moment.

				CLAUDIA
		Better than that.

	She takes his hand and leads him into an inner room.
	Louis follows behind.

				CLAUDIA
		You haven't fed enough. I can tell
		by your color.


	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	Two beautiful youths, lying asleep on a couch, by a
	table full with a half-eaten meal. Lestat sighs.

				LESTAT
		Oh, Claudia, you've outdone
		yourself. Where did you find them?

				CLAUDIA
		Drunk on brandy wine. A thimbleful.
		I thought of you when I saw them.

				LESTAT
		We forgive each other then?

	Claudia stares at him, sitting. She nods.

	Lestat bites into the neck of one of the youths, sucks
	greedily and horribly. Claudia watches him without
	expression. He finished one, is about to take the other
	when he staggers. He looks at Claudia.

				LESTAT
		Absinthe? You gave them absinthe?

				CLAUDIA
		No. Laudanum.

	Lestat stares wildly at her, tries to move towards her,
	then slips to the floor.

				LESTAT
		Laudanum!

				CLAUDIA
		Yes. It killed them, unfortunately.
		But it keeps the blood warm.

	Lestat tries to rise.

				LESTAT
		Ah Louis, Louis, she killed them...
		and let me drink...

	Louis watches, appalled. He goes to move.

				CLAUDIA
		Don't Louis -

				LESTAT
		Louis, put me in my coffin...

				CLAUDIA
		I'll put you in your coffin.
		Forever.

	She pulls a knife out from under her shawl, walks
	rapidly to him and slashes his throat. Blood explodes
	from it.

				LOUIS
		Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!

				LESTAT
		Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift -
		help me -

	Claudia lacerates his face. Blood pours from
	everywhere. She plunges the knife in his chest. He
	falls back, fangs bared, clutching the knife. Claudia
	leaps on him then, bites deep into his neck as he dies.
	Louis screams, runs forward, pulls her away.

				LOUIS
		What have you done, Claudia -

	He drags her off Lestat, tries to pull her out of the
	room. She hisses at him.

				CLAUDIA
		Louis! Look what's happening to
		him!!

	Louis looks. The floor is a sea of blood. Lestat has
	begun to shrivel, as if he'd been a bag of blood. His
	skin is shriveling against his bones like parchment,
	his eyes are slipping back into his skull-like face.
	His lush, beautiful hair remains unchanged. But his
	clothes are virtually being emptied of the body. It is
	no more than bones, wrapped in paper and the pupils of
	the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull.

				LOUIS
		Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.

				CLAUDIA
		Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.

	She stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin
	wrapping. She is fascinated. She sees the vampiric
	blood flow all over the floor. She touches it and
	brings her finger to her lips.

				CLAUDIA
		Goodnight, sweet prince, may
		flights of devils wing you to your
		rest.

	Louis walks forward, touches the skeleton, the blonde
	hair.

				LOUIS
		He's dead, Claudia, dead.

				CLAUDIA
		The one good lesson he taught me,
		Louis. Never drink from the dead.

	She stands up, all business suddenly.

				CLAUDIA
		Help me. We must get rid of him.

	She drags the coverlet from the table, knocking the
	crockery over the dead youths, and wraps Lestat's
	skeleton in it. She takes a bunch of chrysanthemums and
	places them in his skeleton hands.

				CLAUDIA
		Should we burn him? Bury him? What
		would he have liked, Louis?

				LOUIS
		Don't mock, Claudia...

				CLAUDIA
		The swamp...


	EXT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT

	Louis whipping the horses. Claudia beside him. Lestat's
	skeleton in the back, with the bodies of the two dead
	youths.

				CLAUDIA
		In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our
		own kind. Find the one who made
		him. Learn what it means.

				LOUIS
		And suppose the one who made him
		knows nothing and the vampire who
		made him knows nothing, and it goes
		back, nothing proceeding from
		nothing, until there is nothing!
		And we must live with the knowledge
		that there is no knowledge.
		
	The carriage pulls up by a swamp. Mist everywhere.
	Overhanging creepers.

				LOUIS
		And if we find the one who made
		him? Do we tell him we destroyed
		his own creation? The vampire
		Lestat?

	Louis drags out the bodies of the boys. He slides them
	into the waters of the swamp. We see ripples in the
	water and the churning of alligators, as they attack
	the corpses. Louis takes Lestat's skeleton in his arms.
	He slides it into the waters. The alligators speed
	towards it.

				CLAUDIA
		He belongs with those reptiles,
		Louis. He deserved to die.

				LOUIS
		Then maybe so do we. Every night of
		our lives. He was my brother. My
		maker. He gave me this life,
		whatever it is.

				CLAUDIA
		I did it for us, Louis. So we could
		be free.

	He stands there, saying nothing.

				CLAUDIA
		Louis, look at me.

				LOUIS
			(bitterly)
		I can't. Go away from me.

	Claudia is shocked to her core. She steps back. Louis
	stares at the rippling waters. Gradually the movement
	of alligators stops. Then he hears a sound he hasn't
	heard in years. Soft, choking. He turns, sees Claudia
	sitting by a cypress tree, like a little girl for the
	first time in years. She is weeping copiously.

				LOUIS
		Claudia - You're crying -

	We see her face, tears of blood running down it. She is
	heartbroken, lost.

				CLAUDIA
		You never talked to me like that -
		in all these years.

				LOUIS
		And you never cried -

				CLAUDIA
		I can't bear it when you do - I
		would die rather than lose you
		Louis. I would die the way he died.

	Louis gathers her in his arms.

				LOUIS
		Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -

				CLAUDIA
		Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I
		did it for you -

	Louis walks her towards the carriage.

				LOUIS
		I love you Claudia. Always. And we
		are free now, Claudia. No Lestat.
		Just the two of us, beginning the
		great adventure of our lives.

	He lifts her into the carriage and drives off, leaving
	the silent waters of the swamp.


	INT. FLAT - NIGHT

	Sturdy mulatto workmen lifting cases and trunks out of
	the apartment. All the furniture is covered in white
	sheets. Claudia dressed in a cap and hat, is playing
	the piano by the light of one remaining oil-lamp.

	Louis comes from her room with the cage of canaries.

				LOUIS
		The birds. We forgot about the
		birds. There's nothing for it but
		to let them go.

	He opens the cage, and the canaries fly around the
	room.

	There is a knocking on the door. Claudia falters.

				CLAUDIA
		What was that?

				LOUIS
		The workmen must have a trunk -
		don't stop, cherie -

	He goes downstairs. Claudia plays a moment, then stops,
	perturbed. She goes to the window. Then sees something
	out there that makes her face go white. She screams.

				CLAUDIA
		Louis!!!


	THE STAIRWAY

	Louis walking to the door. The knocking gets louder.


	THE PARLOUR

	Claudia runs for the stairs, after Louis.


	THE HALLWAY

	Louis reaches the door. The knocking gets louder. He
	opens the door as -


	CLAUDIA

	Reaches the stairs. She screams -

				CLAUDIA
		Don't Louis -

	But Louis has opened the door. Nothing there. He looks
	back at Claudia, puzzled, then at the door again when,
	swooping into his vision comes the nightmare image of -


	LESTAT

	In filthy swamp-soaked rags, robust again, but his
	flesh shriveled, covered in scars, his eyes riddled,
	bloodshot. he roars.

				LESTAT
		WHERE IS SHE? WHERE IS THAT
		ACCURSED CHILD?

	Louis throws his body against the door, slamming it on
	Lestat's reaching hand. The hand withdraws, as Lestat
	roars. Louis bolts the door.

	Louis runs up the stairs, sweeps Claudia in his arms,
	watching appalled as the door shudders with the force
	of Lestat's body.


	IN THE PARLOUR

	Louis runs through with Claudia in his arms.

				LOUIS
		It can't be -

				CLAUDIA
		It is! Take the back stairwell -

	Suddenly Lestat crashes through the casement window,
	scattering blood everywhere, reefing himself on the
	shattered glass. He tumbles to the floor and gets
	unsteadily to his feet.

				LESTAT
		GIVE ME HER LOUIS!!

	Louis throws Claudia behind him and hurls himself on
	Lestat, who fights like a ravening animal, bits of his
	broken body coming off in the process. Then with a
	terrifying effort, Lestat hurls Louis off, goes for
	Claudia, who grabs the poker from the fireplace,
	scatters burning coals over him. He falls back, then
	comes at her again, as the drapes catch fire. Louis
	grabs the lamp.

				LOUIS
		Stay back - for the love of God...
		or I'll burn you alive...

	Lestat lunges again at Claudia.

	Louis hurls the lamp, which explodes him in flame.

	Lestat screams in agony, whirls around the room, then
	comes on Claudia again. She hurls another lamp.

	Louis throws the flaming sheets around him, wrapping
	him further in fire. Lestat falls to his knees,
	choking, hands up over his face in the smoke. The whole
	parlor is afire. Louis gathers up Claudia, smothering
	the burning house, carries her down the back stairs,
	through the carriage way and through the gathering
	crowds of mortals into the street.


	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Louis running, with Claudia in his arms. He looks back
	at the flames of the house. Sound of a ship's horn.

				CLAUDIA
		The ship is sailing without us!

				LOUIS
		Not yet. Holding her tightly, Louis
		runs.


	EXT. DECK OF SHIP - NEAR DAWN

	Louis stands at the railings in the morning mist as the
	ship moves down the river. He sees...


	CITY OF NEW ORLEANS

	With flame lighting up the sky.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Though the fire seemed to spread
		through the quartier, I stood on
		that deck until dawn, fearful he
		would come out again of the very
		river like some monster to destroy
		us both. And all the while I
		thought, Lestat, we deserve your
		vengeance. You gave me the dark
		gift. And I delivered you into the
		hands of death for the second time.


	INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO

	Louis and Malloy.

				MALLOY
		Did he die in the fire?

				LOUIS
		He was dead to us. We were free.
		That was all that mattered.


	EXT. SHIP - EVENING

	The ship, shrouded in mist.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Though the ship was blessedly free
		of rats, a strange plague
		nonetheless struck its passengers.

	A body is slipped into the sea. A priest reads last
	rites to a mourning family.


	INT. SHIPS HOLD

	Trunks and cases, creaking with the ship's movement.
	Dead rats everywhere.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		Claudia and I alone seemed immune.
		We kept to ourselves, pondering the
		mystery of Lestat and the greater
		mystery of each other.
		

	EXT. SHIP - NIGHT

	Passing through the Straits of Gibralter.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		We reached the Mediterranean. I
		wanted those waters to be blue.
		They were black, nighttime waters
		and how I suffered then, straining
		to remember the color that a young
		man's senses had taken for granted,
		that my memory had let slip away
		for eternity. It was black off the
		coast of Italy, black off the coast
		of Greece, Europe itself was black.
		

	EXT. DECK - NIGHT

	Claudia, sitting with an easel and sketch-pad,
	sketching the bay of Naples. A beautifully realized
	drawing, all in shades of grey and black. Louis
	observes.

				CLAUDIA
		Louis, your quest is for darkness
		only. This sea is not your sea.
		They myths of men are not your
		myths. Their history isn't yours.

	The sketch changes to a sketch of -


	THE ACROPOLIS

	In the moonlight.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		We saw the Acropolis by moonlight,
		shades of grey and silver. And I
		longed for the brilliant white of
		those marbles in the hot sun of
		Homer...

	The sketch changes to a sketch of -


	TRANSYLVANIA

	And the traditional shapes of the vampire landscape.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		We docked at Varna and searched the
		rural countryside of the
		Carpathians, for what she liked to
		term "our kind"...


	MONTAGE OF SKETCHES

	A TRANSLYVANIAN VILLAGE, A GRAVEYARD.

	RUINED CASTLE AFTER CASTLE, LOOKING INTO THE SKIES...

				LOUIS
		The quest for these Old World
		vampires filled me with bitterness.
		We searched village after village,
		ruin after ruin and I was glad when
		always we found nothing. For what
		could the damned really have to say
		to the damned?


	INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO

	Malloy and Louis.

				MALLOY
		You found nothing?

				LOUIS
		Peasant rumors, superstitions about
		garlic, crosses, stakes in the
		hear, all that - how do you say
		again? Bull shit. But one of our
		kind? Not a whisper.

				MALLOY
		No vampires in Transylvania? No
		Count Dracula?

				LOUIS
		Fictions, my friend. The vulgar
		fictions of a demented Irishman...
		So we repaired to Paris...


	EXT. BOULEVARD FACADE OF GRAND HOTEL AND PARIS OPERA

	Crowds and gaslight everywhere. Carriages, horses,
	OPERA coming from the opera house.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I think the very name of Paris
		brought a rush of pleasure to me
		that was extraordinary. I was a
		Creole, after all and Paris was the
		mother of New Orleans, a universe
		whole and entire unto herself...


	EXT. 18TH CENTURE PALACES ALONG THE SEINE - NIGHT

	The high walls of the Louvre, dark figures walking in
	pairs through the shadowy tulieries.


	EXT. STREET - SHOP WINDOW

	Claudia, in furtrimmed muff and bonnet, peers through
	the glass at a display of dolls. Each doll in there
	seems to resemble her, with blonde hair and blue eyes.
	She peers deep into the shop and sees -

	MADELEINE, a young woman bent over a workbench painting
	a doll's face, oblivious to being watched.


	INT. OPERA STAIRCASE

	Louis and Claudia hurrying hand in hand with a crowd of
	mortals towards the sound of an ORCHESTRA TURNING
	beyond.


	INT. NOTRE DAME

	Claudia and Louis standing in the deep shadows, looking
	at the branching arches. Louis is overcome with
	sadness, Claudia is fascinated.


	INT. GALLERY

	Louis and Claudia walk among a series of mythological
	nudes by Poussin.


	INT. SALON - NIGHT

	Claudia, surrounded by discarded dresses and outfits,
	being attended by couturiers. All the clothes are tiny,
	to fit her frame, but have an adult cut and shape.

				LOUIS
		We were alive again. We were in
		love and so euphoric was I that I
		yielded to her every desire...


	INT. SUMPRUOUS HOTEL SUITE

	Full of late 19th century furniture, lots of Empire
	style, Regency, gilt, velvet and brocade.


	CLOSE ON A HUGE BLACK EBONY CHEST

	Against a wall, solemn among all the light and glitter.


	CLAUDIA

	By a large gilt mirror, in her new clothes. She is
	covered with jewelry, fixing earrings to her ears.

				CLAUDIA
		Help me, mon chere...

	Louis walks over, helps her with the earrings.

				CLAUDIA
		How do I look?

				LOUIS
		Still my beautiful child.

	Claudia laughs.

				CLAUDIA
		A beautiful child! Is that what you
		still think I am?

				LOUIS
		Yes...

	He turns away.

				CLAUDIA
		Why do you turn away? Why don't you
		look.

	She twirls, looking at herself in the mirror, then
	stops, stares at herself.

				CLAUDIA
		You want me to be your daughter
		forever, don't you?

				LOUIS
		Yes.

				CLAUDIA
		Well tell me, papa. What was it
		like making love?

	Louis is stunned. He blushes.

				CLAUDIA
		You don't remember? Or you never
		knew.

				LOUIS
		It was something hurries...and
		seldom savored... something acute
		that was quickly lost. It was the
		pale shadow of killing.

				CLAUDIA
		But how will I ever know, Louis?

	She stares at him through the mirror.

				CLAUDIA
		I'll never find them, will I? My
		own kind...


	EXT. BOULEVARD - EVENING

	Louis and Claudia walk along a boulevard like father
	and daughter. All around them are bourgeois Parisian
	families on their evening stroll. Claudia points at the
	children that pass.

				CLAUDIA
		Have I anything in common with her,
		Louis?

	She points to a beautiful French child walking by with
	her mother.

				CLAUDIA
		Or her, or her - or any of them?

				LOUIS
		Claudia, you torture yourself.

				CLAUDIA
		They are ducklings, that will grow
		into swans. Whereas I must be the
		duckling forever.

				LOUIS
		You are more beautiful than any of
		them.


	EXT. DOLL-SHOP - NIGHT

	We see Madeleine, inside, painting a doll's face. Louis
	and Claudia arrive outside.

				CLAUDIA
		All her dolls resemble me.


	POV

	Claudia's face, with the dolls in the background. The
	resemblance is uncanny.

				CLAUDIA
		Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never
		change either.

				LOUIS
		You are neither, Claudia. Now stop
		this -

	Madeleine sees Claudia from inside. She waves.

				LOUIS
		You know her?

				CLAUDIA
		Yes. Should I take her, Louis?
		Among her dolls? make a doll of her
		in turn?

				LOUIS
		Come, Claudia...

	He takes her arm. But Claudia shakes him off, and moves
	into the shop.


	EXT. LATIN QUARTER - NIGHT

	Louis walks briskly, head bowed.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		For a time we had been almost
		human, in the sensual whirl of what
		Paris had to offer. But the human
		delights of that city only served
		to remind her of the ageless child
		she had become. I felt her pain as
		I walked until I become aware that
		I was being followed.


	CLOSEUP - LOUIS' FEET

	Walking. A step echoes his.

	Louis stops. Turns, sees nothing. Then walks again. The
	echoing steps begin again.

	Louis again. Sees a shadow, flitting.

				LOUIS
		Claudia!

	Nothing. He walks again, hears the same effect. Then he
	stops. He stares at a gaslamp opposite.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		So it was when I had given up the
		search for vampires that a vampire
		found me...

	Santiago, a tall vampire, materializes under the
	gaslight. And Louis gradually realizes that this
	vampire has assumed the same attitude, posture, clothes
	and hair-style as Louis.

	Louis gives an involuntary shake of the head. Santiago
	mimics. Louis takes a step forwards. Santiago mimics.
	Louis folds his arms. Santiago mimics.

				LOUIS & STATIAGO
			(simultaneously)
		Clever.

				LOUIS
		You mean me harm?

				SANTIAGO
			(a beat later)
		You mean me harm?

	Louis calculates.

				LOUIS
		Trickster. Buffoon!

	Santiago echoes the first word, but not the second.
	Louis has broken his composure. He turns his back on
	Santiago, only to come face to face with Santiago right
	in front of him.

	Again Louis turns this back to find Santiago facing
	him.

	Louis turns, glowers, refusing to look at him.

				LOUIS
		I've searched the world for an
		immortal and this is what I find?

	Slowly he looks up. Santiago draws close, breaking the
	mirror trick and suddenly slams Louis back against the
	wall.

	Louis is furious. He regains his balance, strikes out
	at Santiago and when Santiago vanishes, to reappear
	behind him, Louis slams back his elbow into his
	midriff. Santiago staggers, amazed and then rushes at
	Louis, throwing him down.

	Louis rolls back to his feet, then to his amazement
	sees two vampires, on in front, on behind. He looks
	both ways, then sees one has vanished. He stares,
	awestruck, at this new one:

				ARMAND
		He looks like an angel.

				ARMAND
		You are all right.

	He reaches into his waistcoat, takes an engraved
	invitation out of his pocket and thrusts it at Louis.

	Louis reads it aloud, as we see:

	"THEATRE DES VAMPIRES
	By Special Invitation
	Friday, 9 p.m."

				ARMAND
		Bring the petit beauty with you. No
		one will harm you. I won't allow
		it. Remember my name. Armand.

	Armand bows and vanishes.

	Louis listens to the silence.


	EXT BOULEVARD DES CAPUCHINES - THEATRE DES VAMPIRES -
	NIGHT

	Louis formally dressed with Claudia in rich attire on
	his arm. They pass people buying tickets for the
	theatre and go inside.

				LOUIS
		Remember what I've told you.
		They'll have different powers.
		They'll read your thoughts if you
		allow it.

	They draw close to:


	HUGE POSTERS

	Reading -

	"THEATRE DES VAMPIRES PRESENTS
	THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH
	By Edgar Allen Poe"

	The posters are illustrated with cliched images of
	vampires overcoming damsels in distress.


	ANOTHER ANGLE

				CLAUDIA
		But this can't be real. This is
		nonsense.

				LOUIS
		Nonsense all right. But something
		tell me it's going to be the
		strangest nonsense we've ever seen.

	Warily, they show their invitations to the mortal
	ticket taker at the door. He glances away
	indifferently.


	INT. THEATRE BOX - NIGHT

	Claudia and Louis look at the crowd as the lights go
	down.

				CLAUDIA
		Mortals, mortals everywhere. And
		lots of drops to drink.

				LOUIS
		They are here. I know they are.
		Listen for something that doesn't
		make a sound.

	Stage: curtain rises.

	An elaborate painted set of an Italianate castle. Death
	standing before it, the traditional image of the Grim
	Reaper, complete with magnificent scythe.

				LOUIS
			(whispers)
		It's a vampire. It's the one I saw
		in Rue St Jacques.

	A version of the Poe story unfolds before them. All of
	the participants are vampires. All beautiful gleaming
	white, aged 20 or 30.

				LOUIS
		They use no paint. And the audience
		think it is paint.

				CLAUDIA
		How devilishly clever.

	A spotlight uncovers a mortal woman suddenly forced out
	upon the stage.

				CLAUDIA
		She's no vampire.

				LOUIS
		No. She's frightened. She doesn't
		know where she is.

	The audience laughs uneasily, then stops as the Mortal
	Woman comes into the footlights. She is too beautiful,
	too confused. Santiago, as Death, advances on her. She
	backs away, terrified, then sees the other vampires, in
	a phalanx, advancing from behind, in a half-circle.

				MORTAL WOMAN
		I don't want to die!

	She looks around in panic. Santiago swoons, arms over
	his breast as if he is hopelessly in love.

				SANTIAGO
		We are death!

	The Mortal Woman steps to the footlights.

				MORTAL WOMAN
		Someone help me. Please... What
		have I done?

	Louis whispers to Claudia.

				LOUIS
		This is no performance.

				CLAUDIA
		And no one knows but us...


	ON THE STAGE

				SANTIAGO
		We all die. Death is the one thing
		you share with all those here.

	Santiago gestures to the audience.


	AUDIENCE

	Rapt faces.


	ON THE STAGE

				MORTAL WOMAN
		But I'm young...

				SANTIAGO
		Death is no respecter of age. He
		can come any time, any place. Need
		I tell you what fate has in store
		for you?

				MORTAL WOMAN
		I would take my chance. Let me go!
		Please...

				SANTIAGO
		And if you take that chance and
		live, what is your fate? The
		humpbacked toothless visage of old
		age?

	Santiago approaches her and tears the drawstring out of
	her peasant blouse. It opens completely and starts to
	slip. She tries to catch it, but gently stops her
	wrists. The blouse falls, exposing her young breasts.


	LOUIS AND CLAUDIA

				LOUIS
		This is monstrous!

				CLAUDIA
		Yes, and very beautiful.


	ON THE STAGE

				SANTIAGO
		Just as this flesh is pink now, it
		will turn grey and wrinkle with
		age.

				MORTAL WOMAN
		Let me live, please. I don't care.

				SANTIAGO
		Then why should you care if you die
		now?

	She shakes her head, confused. he catches her wrists
	behind her back.


	AUDIENCE

	Is awestruck by her beauty, her suffering.


	SANTIAGO

	Draws near her cheek.

				SANTIAGO
		And suppose death had a heart to
		love and to release you? To whom
		would he turn his passion? Would
		you pick a person from the crowd
		there? A person to suffer as you
		suffer?


	AUDIENCE

	A young girl cries out in jest.

				YOUNG GIRL
		Oh, yes, take me Monsieur Vampire!
		I adore you!

	Audience roars with laughter.


	ON THE STAGE

				SANTIAGO
		You wait your turn.

	The audience laughs again.

	The Mortal Woman shakes her head in panic.

				SANTIAGO
		Well, have you a sister, a mother,
		a daughter you would send in your
		place?


	CLOSE ON CLAUDIA

	Even she is repelled by the cruelty. She shakes her
	head.


	MORTAL WOMAN

	Shakes her head. She is helpless.

				SANTIAGO
		We alone can give death meaning. Do
		you know what it means to be loved
		by death, to become our bride?

	Mortal Woman looks up on the verge of hysteria or
	fainting. But then her eyes mist over. She is being
	entranced.


	FROM HER POV

	We realize she is looking past Santiago at the divinely
	beautiful Armand, who has just stepped out of the
	wings. Armand has entranced her. He passes Santiago.
	Santiago stiffens, but yields the stage.

				ARMAND
		No pain.

				MORTAL WOMAN
		No pain?

	Armand takes her by the naked shoulders.

				ARMAND
		Your beauty is a gift to us.


	ON THE STAGE

	Armand gestures to the others who slowly, gracefully
	close in.

				ARMAND
		Who deserves such a gift?

	He pulls the drawstring from her skirt and it falls
	revealing her nakedness. But she is spellbound.

				MORTAL WOMAN
		No pain...

	Armand embraces her, drinks, her naked body stark
	against her black clothes, then he passes her to the
	other vampires one by one.


	CLOSE ON LOUIS

	Who battles desire and hunger with anger.

				LOUIS
		I've seen enough of this! I loathe
		it!

				CLAUDIA
		Be still!


	ON THE STAGE

	The naked Mortal Woman lies dead on the floor. The
	vampires seem to vanish one by one. As the curtain
	draws across, the Audience loudly applauds what they
	presume are theatrical tricks.


	ANOTHER ANGLE

	The audience, milling towards the exits. They talk in
	vacuous terms about the beauty of the show, the
	symbolism of it, the daring of it as they leave.

	Gradually Louis and Claudia are left alone in the empty
	theatre. Louis seems anxious to leave. Claudia whispers
	in his ear.

				CLAUDIA
		Patience, Louis. Patience.

	He looks around the empty theatre, more eerie now than
	when the play was on. The red curtain shifts slightly
	in a hidden breeze, a candle sputters and dies in a
	box. Then the candle flares again, and we see Armand in
	the box, looking down on them. He stares with a dreamy
	expression, saying nothing.

				LOUIS
		We've been searching for you for a
		very long time...

	His voice echoes eerily. Armand gestures for them to
	follow him.


	INT. FOOT OF STAIRWAY

	Armand leading, Louis and Claudia following. It opens
	into a -


	HUGE UNDERGROUND BALLROOM

	Walls are painted with famous copies of Durer,
	Brueghel, Goya and Bosch depictions of death. Fine
	wooden coffins line the walls. Candles burn in sconces,
	casting alternate shadows and pools of light. Armand
	walks through, gesturing Louis and Claudia to follow
	him.

	As they walk through, vampire man and women appear out
	of the shadows like wraiths, startling them, drifting
	around them, stroking them, touching Claudia as if she
	were a doll. Shrieks of preternatural laughter.

	Armand gestures to the vampires to back off.

	All obey but ESTELLE.

				ESTELLE
		Such a darling.

	She menaces Claudia, her breasts enormous, her fangs
	bared. Armand throw her a look, and she is flung
	against the wall.

	Louis stares around. The vampires faces drift towards
	him and away, always disclosing the face of Armand, who
	seems some distance away, but strangely close, staring
	at Louis with a constantly calm, hypnotic gaze. Then a
	young mortal boy comes from the shadows with a
	candelabra, which he hands to Armand.

	Armand and the boy come towards them, leading them
	along the walls, his candelabra illuminating the
	ghastly murals, his face gleaming like an angel above
	the candleflame.

				LOUIS
		Monstrous.

				ARMAND
		Yes, and very beautiful.

				LOUIS
		Your lips, they didn't move.

				ARMAND
		They did, but too fast for you to
		see them. No magic, just grace and
		speed.

	The boy is watching Louis. Armand's hand beckons and
	the boy draws up to Louis in the candlelight. He places
	his arms on Louis' shoulders. Louis glances at Armand,
	who smiles. Louis sees the puncture marks on the boy's
	neck.

				ARMAND
		He wants you...

	Louis is utterly confused. Can't resist. Drinks his
	blood.

	The boy's body presses against him, sensual, willing.
	The other vampires appear all around Louis, who
	suddenly senses it and draws away, ashamed.

	Claudia watches warily, from a distance. Armand beckons
	at her and Louis and open a door in the wall which
	reveals a stone staircase.


	INT. MEDIEVAL ROOM

	Medieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a bed in one
	corner, a blazing fire. A medieval painting of Satan,
	being banished from heaven, above the fire. Armand
	places the boy on the bed, settling him so he sleeps.

				ARMAND
		Disappointing, isn't it? To come so
		far and find so little. Jaded
		ingenues, amusing themselves with
		make- believe...

				LOUIS
		We had feared we were the only
		ones...

				ARMAND
		But how did you come into
		existence?

	He glances at Louis, then at Claudia, who averts her
	eyes.

				ARMAND
		You don't want to answer... Two
		vampires from the new world, come
		to guide us into the new era as all
		we love slowly rots and fades away.

				LOUIS
		Are you the leader of this group?

				ARMAND
		If there were a leader, I would be
		the one.

	Claudia stares at him constantly, guarded.

				LOUIS
		So you have the answers...

				ARMAND
		Ah! You have questions?

				LOUIS
		What are we?

				ARMAND
		Nothing if not vampires...

				LOUIS
		Who made us what we are?

				ARMAND
		Surely you know the one who made
		you...

				LOUIS
		But the one who made him, who made
		the one who made him, the source of
		all this evil...

	Louis looks at the picture. Armand watches him.

				ARMAND
		That is a picture, nothing more.

				LOUIS
		You mean we are not children of
		Satan?

				ARMAND
		No.

	He smiles at Louis. A smile of infinite compassion.

				ARMAND
		I understand. I saw you in the
		theatre, your suffering, your
		sympathy for that girl. I saw you
		with the boy. You die when you
		kill, you feel you deserve to die
		and you stint on nothing. But does
		that make you evil? Or, since you
		comprehend what you call goodness,
		does it not make you good?

				LOUIS
		Then there is nothing.

				ARMAND
		Perhaps...

	He passes his finger through the candle flame.

				ARMAND
		And perhaps this is the only real
		evil left...

				LOUIS
		Then God does not exist...

				ARMAND
		I have not spoken to him...

				LOUIS
		And no vampire here has discourse
		with God or the Devil?

				ARMAND
		None that I've ever known. I know
		nothing of God or the Devil, I have
		never seen a vision nor learnt a
		secret that would damn or save my
		soul. And as far as I know, after
		four hundred years I am the oldest
		living vampire in the world.

	He stares at them, his face angelic, hypnotic, young.
	His eyes hold them both in a trance.

				LOUIS
		My God... So it's as I always
		feared. Nothing, leading to
		nothing.

				ARMAND
		You fell too much. So much you make
		me feel...

	He stares from Claudia to Louis. He seems to be reading
	their souls.

				ARMAND
		The one who made you should have
		told you this. The one who left the
		old world for the new...

				LOUIS
		He knew nothing. He just didn't
		care.

				ARMAND
		Knew? You mean he is...

	Claudia appears suddenly to Louis' shoulder,
	interrupting.

				CLAUDIA
		Come, beloved. It's time we were on
		our way. I'm hungry and the city
		waits.

	She stares hard at Armand. Armand looks from her to
	Louis.

				ARMAND
		So soon to go?

	He seems genuinely regretful. But Claudia pulls Louis
	out.


	INT. DARKENED CORRIDORS AND THEATRE - NIGHT

	Louis and Claudia feel their way through darkened
	corridors, trying to find their way out.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		The place was dark as we left, a
		darkness that confounded even
		Claudia. And as we blundered
		through it, again came the thought:
		I have wronged Lestat, I have hated
		him for the wrong reasons.

	Suddenly a light comes on. They see they are in the
	empty theatre. Santiago stands on the stage, under a
	candle.

				SANTIAGO
		How did you wrong him?

	Louis is stunned.

				LOUIS
		You read my thoughts?

				SANTIAGO
		You said a name -

				LOUIS
		A name I don't want to say again.

				SANTIAGO
		I seemed to recognize it...

	Other vampires appear behind him.

				SANTIAGO
		There is but one crime among us
		vampires here.

	He looks at Claudia.

				SANTIAGO
		You should know, who are so
		secretive about the vampire who
		made you.

	Claudia laughs.

				CLAUDIA
		Boredom!

				SANTIAGO
		It is the crime that means death to
		any vampire. To kill your own kind!

				CLAUDIA
		Aaaah! I was so afraid it was to be
		born like Venus out of the foam, as
		we were! Come Louis, let's go!


	EXT. HOTEL SAINT GABRIEL - NIGHT

	Claudia and Louis enter the Lobby.

				CLAUDIA
		I loathe them! I can't stand the
		sight of them! Stupid bourgeois
		Parisians, all dressed in black
		like some private club! I've
		searched for them the world over
		and I despise them!

				LOUIS
		What danger?

				CLAUDIA
		I can feel it from them! They want
		to know who made us, what became of
		him. They have their rules, their
		idiotic rules!

	They come to their room, enter.


	INT. HOTEL ROOMS - NIGHT

	Louis closes the door behind him. Claudia paces.

				LOUIS
		Do you think I would let them harm
		you?

				CLAUDIA
		No, you would not, Louis. Danger
		hold you to me.

				LOUIS
		Love holds you to me. And we are in
		danger, not you.

				CLAUDIA
		Love?

	She smiles at him. A strange, sad, adult smile.

				CLAUDIA
		You would leave me for Armand if he
		beckoned you.

				LOUIS
		Never.

				CLAUDIA
		He wants you as you want him. He's
		been waiting for you. He wants you
		for a companion. He bides his time
		that place. he finds them as dull
		and lifeless as we do.

				LOUIS
		That's not so.

				CLAUDIA
		Do you know what his soul said to
		me without saying a word? When he
		put me in that trance...

				LOUIS
		So you felt it too!

				CLAUDIA
		Let him go, he said. Let him go.

	She touches his face.

				CLAUDIA
		Is that what I should do Louis? Let
		you go? My father? My lover? My
		Louis, who made me?

	There are tears in her eyes. Louis lifts her up in his
	arms.

				LOUIS
		He can protect us, Claudia.

				CLAUDIA
		You really believe that?


	EXT. DOLL-SHIP - NIGHT

	Claudia, staring at the dolls. We see Madeleine inside,
	painting a doll. She sees Claudia and smiles and waves.


	INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

	Louis, sitting alone in the box, as the curtains draw
	back, to show Santiago as death, as before. Louis takes
	advantage of the darkness to slip away.


	INT. ARMAND'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Armand opens the door to Louis' knock.

				ARMAND
		I was waiting for you...

				LOUIS
		Listen to me.

	He follows Armand into the room.

				LOUIS
		Claudia is dear to me. My...
		daughter.

				ARMAND
		Your lover.

				LOUIS
		No, my beloved, my child.

				ARMAND
		If you say so. You are innocent.

				LOUIS
		I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid.
		She feels she's in danger from the
		others.

				ARMAND
		She is.

				LOUIS
		But why?

				ARMAND
		I could give you reasons. Her
		silence. Her youth. It's forbidden
		to make so young, so helpless, that
		cannot survive on its own.

				LOUIS
		Then blame the one who made her...

				ARMAND
		Did you kill this vampire who made
		you both? Is that why you won't say
		his name? Santiago thinks you did.

				LOUIS
		We want no quarrel with him.

				ARMAND
		It's already begun. If you want to
		save her, send her away.

				LOUIS
		Then I leave too.

	Armand smiles.

				ARMAND
		So soon? Without any of those
		answers you so longed for?

				LOUIS
		You said there were none.

				ARMAND
		But you asked the wrong questions.
		Do you know how few vampires have
		the stamina for immortality? How
		quickly they perish of their own
		will.

				LOUIS
		We can do that?

				ARMAND
		You would never give up life. If
		the world were reduced to one empty
		cell, on fragile candle, you stay
		alive and study it. You see too
		clearly. You see too much.

				LOUIS
		That's what the one who made me
		said.

				ARMAND
		How he must have loved you.

	Armand suddenly grips Louis close to him.

				ARMAND
		Louis, I need you more than he ever
		did. I need a link with this
		century. The world changes. We do
		not. Therein lies the irony that
		ultimately kills us. I need you to
		make contact with this age.

	Louis laughs bitterly.

				LOUIS
		He? Don't you see? I'm not the
		spirit of any age! I'm at odds with
		everything and always have been!
		I'm not even sure what I am!

	Armand smiles.

				ARMAND
		But Louis, that is the very spirit
		of your age. The heart of it. You
		fall from grace has been the fall
		of a century.

	Louis is stunned.

				LOUIS
		And the vampires of the Theatre?

				ARMAND
		Like moths around the candle of the
		age. Decadent, useless. They can't
		reflect anything. But you do. You
		reflect its broken heart.

	Louis is speechless.

				ARMAND
		Are these not the answers you came
		for?

				LOUIS
			(softly)
		Yes... My God...

				ARMAND
		A vampire with a human soul. An
		immortal with a mortal's passion.
		You are beautiful, my friend.
		Lestat must have wept when he made
		you -

				LOUIS
		Lestat! You knew Lestat!

				ARMAND
		Yes I knew him. Knew him well
		enough not to mourn his passing.

	Armand stands. He takes Louis by the arm, leads him
	towards the back wall.

				ARMAND
		But you must go now. You must get
		her safely out of Paris.

	He opens a hidden door in the wall.

				ARMAND
		No-one else knows of this door.
		When you knock you will find me
		waiting...


	EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - NIGHT

	Louis, in the street outside, as the door closes behind
	him.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I felt a kind of peace at last. I
		had found the teacher which Lestat
		could never, I knew now, have been.
		I knew knowledge would never be
		withheld by Armand. It would pass
		through him as through a pane of
		glass. And I knew Claudia must
		leave me...


	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

	Louis enters. There is unfamiliar scent in the air, a
	doll sitting by the mirror. Louis looks in the mirror
	and sees...


	MADELEINE

	The doll-maker, resplendent in green taffeta, sitting
	like a Madonna with Claudia on her lap. Claudia's arms
	are wound round her neck. The contrast between mortal
	woman and immortal child is plain.

				CLAUDIA
		Madeleine... Louis is shy.

	Madeleine rises and comes towards Louis. She draws back
	the lace fringes round her throat, so he can see the
	two marks there. She says softly, dreamily.

				MADELEINE
		Drink.

	Louis turns away. Claudia speaks, icy, from the bed.

				CLAUDIA
		Do it Louis. Because I cannot do
		it. I haven't the strength. You saw
		to that when you made me.

	Louis turns to Madeleine.

				LOUIS
		You haven't the vaguest conception
		under God of what you ask!

				MADELEINE
		Au contraire, monsieur, I have.

	Louis pushes her away. Claudia screams.

				CLAUDIA
		You have found your new companion,
		Louis! You will make me mine!

	Louis grips Madeleine and shakes her.

				LOUIS
		How do we seem to you? Do you think
		us beautiful, magical, our white
		skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you
		ask me! Have you any idea of the
		thing you will become?

				CLAUDIA
		Your evil is that you cannot be
		evil! And I will suffer for it no
		longer!

				LOUIS
		Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do
		it!

				CLAUDIA
		Yet you could do it to me!
		Snatching me from my mother's hands
		like two monsters in a fairy-tale!
		Couldn't you have waited? Six more
		years and I would have had that
		shape! And now you weep! You
		haven't tears enough for what
		you've done to me.

	She points to Madeleine

				CLAUDIA
		You give her to me! Do this before
		you leave me!

	She begins to weep, sobbing like a child.

				CLAUDIA
		Oh God! I love you still, that's
		the torment of it. But you know I
		must leave you Louis...

				LOUIS
		Yes...

				CLAUDIA
		And who will care for me my love,
		my dark angel, when you are gone?

	Louis looks at Madeleine

				LOUIS
		You promise to care for her then?

				MADELEINE
		Yes...

				LOUIS
		And you know what you ask for?

	She wraps her arms around Claudia.

				MADELEINE
		Yes.

				LOUIS
		What do you think she is,
		Madeleine? A doll?

				MADELEINE
		A child who can't die...

	Her finger clutches a locket around her neck, Louis
	touches it, opens it.


	THE LOCKET

	A picture of a young girl, Claudia's age, wistful,
	beautiful.

				LOUIS
			(softly)
		And the child who did die?

				MADELEINE
		My daughter...

	Louis takes her chin in his hand, gently.

				LOUIS
		Look at the gaslight. Don't take
		your eyes off it. You will be
		drained to the point of death, but
		you must stay alive. Do you hear
		me?

				MADELEINE
		Yes!

	Louis pulls her to him and starts to drink her blood.


	EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - LATER

	Louis on the balcony, weakened terribly. A breeze blows
	on the gauze curtains behind him, through which we
	see...

	SILHOUETTES of Madeleine and Claudia. Madeleine her
	arms outstretched, now a vampire, a long moan of pain
	coming from her. Claudia comes through the curtains,
	alarmed.

				CLAUDIA
			(whispers)
		Louis!

	Louis speaks without turning.

				LOUIS
		She is dying. It happened to you
		too, but your child's mind can't
		remember.

				CLAUDIA
		But if she dies...

				LOUIS
		It's only mortal death.

	He turns to look at Claudia.

				LOUIS
		Bear me no ill will, my love. We
		are now even.

				CLAUDIA
		What do you mean?

				LOUIS
		What died tonight inside that room
		was not that woman. It will take
		her many nights to die, perhaps
		years. What has died in that room
		tonight is the last vestige in me
		of what was human.

	She takes his hand.

				CLAUDIA
		Yes father. At last. We are een.

	He bends down and kisses her. He looks up, at the
	wafting curtains. He sees -


	MANY VAMPIRE SHADOWS

	Silhouetted, coming closer.


	CLAUDIA

	Looks up and screams.


	THE CURTAINS

	Are ripped aside. The vampires of the Theatre surge
	through.

				ESTELLE
		Time for justice, little one.

	The vampires close on them as Louis struggles,
	Claudia's scream pierces the night air.


	INT. CORRIDOR OF THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - NIGHT

	In a press of vampires, Louis, Claudia and Madeleine
	are forced down the dark corridor. Into -


	THE BALLROOM

	Vampire chaos, as they are dragged through. Louis
	struggling like a demon.

				LOUIS
		Armand! Get me Armand! he wouldn't
		countenance this -

				SANTIAGO
		You can make no demands here!
		Buffoon! Bastard -

	Santiago strikes Louis to the ground. As he struggles
	to his feet, he sees the vampires part around a figure
	coming through. He gasps at the sight of -


	LESTAT

	Dressed beautifully, but horribly scarred now, from the
	fire as well as the earlier stabbing. Lestat is
	confused, ancient, teetering, reaching for Santiago's
	shoulder to steady himself.

				LESTAT
		Louis...

				SANTIAGO
		Is he the one?

	Lestat shakes his head.

				LESTAT
		No, the child. The child was the
		one...

				SANTIAGO
		All the murderers!!!

				LOUIS
		You are alive, Lestat! It can't be
		murder! Tell them how you treated
		us...

	Lestat reaches out to Louis.

				LESTAT
		No... You come back to me Louis...

				LOUIS
		Are you mad???

				ESTELLE
		The sentence is death! To all of
		them!!!

				LESTAT
		Only the girl - it was the girl -

	The sound of something being dragged through the crowd.
	Horrible echoing, scraping -

	Lestat grips Santiago.

				LESTAT
		You promised me - I could take him
		back to New Orleans - Louis -
		there's something I must tell you -
		about that night - that night I met
		you -

	He stares around him, confused. The scraping gets
	louder.

				LOUIS
		You let her go, Lestat - you let
		her free - and I'll come back with
		you -

	Santiago grabs Louis by the neck.

				SANTIAGO
		Death for the others. For you
		eternity in a box -

	We see now what caused the scraping. A huge metal
	coffin being dragged through the vampires. Claudia
	screams.

				SANTIAGO
		Walled in a dungeon. Your only
		company will be your screams...
		Perhaps it will take centuries...

	The vampires grab Louis. They force him towards the
	coffin. Lestat struggles with them.

				LESTAT
		He's coming home with me - you
		promised -

				SANTIAGO
			(laughing)
		We promised nothing!

	Louis struggles fiercely as he is forced into the
	coffin. Claudia weeps.

				LOUIS
		They've fooled you, Lestat! You
		must reach Armand! Armand has the
		power!

	Louis, struggling in the coffin. Then the lid is forced
	down, huge locks closed over it.


	INT. COFFIN

	Louis, in the smallest imaginable space. Beating his
	forehead against the metal.


	EXT. COFFIN

	Claudia, throwing herself on the coffin, crying. She is
	dragged away. Vampire hands drag the coffin across the
	stone floor.


	INT. COFFIN

	Louis, forehead pouring with blood, being thrown this
	way and that. The coffin is lifted, upside down, Louis'
	head crashes off the floor.


	EXT. COFFIN

	Is thrust into a niche in the wall. Bricks being placed
	over, mortar trowelled on.


	INT. COFFIN

	Louis upside down. Sounds of bricks and mortar. Then
	terrifying, unearthly scream pierces the coffin,
	striking to his very soul.

				LOUIS
		Claudia!!!

	He loses consciousness.


	BLACKNESS

	INT. COFFIN

	Louis sleeps, upside down. Sound of bricks being
	broken, thrown aside. Then of locks breaking.

	Louis opens his eyes. The lid opens. He sees -

				ARMAND
		Above him, reaching down to take
		his hand.

				ARMAND
		Hurry. Don't make a sound.

	Louis gets out, into a vast long catacomb. Louis runs
	to the end of it, steps through a broken brick wall.

				LOUIS
		Where is she? Where's Claudia?

				ARMAND
		Follow me - that way - through my
		cell -

	He points to his cell at the end of the passage, the
	foot of the steps. Sound of rain beyond the door.

				LOUIS
		Not without Claudia. Where is she?

				ARMAND
		I can't save her.

				LOUIS
		You can't believe I'd leave without
		her. Armand! You must save her! You
		have no choice.

				ARMAND
		Louis, I can't save her. I will
		only risk losing you -

	Louis runs up the stone stairs. It leads to the
	ballroom. He enters.

	Estelle stands far off, looking at him coolly. She
	lifts the stage skull mask and laughs softly behind it.
	A male vampire slumps in a chair staring softly at
	Louis.

	Silence. Indifference.

	Louis sees Lestat sitting in a far corner. he rushes up
	to Lestat, who looks up at him, confused. He's holding
	something crumpled, made of cloth.

				LESTAT
		You'll come home with me Louis? For
		a little while... until I am myself
		again.

				LOUIS
		CLAUDIA!!!

	Louis turns round and round in rage. Passive still
	faces. A door bangs open and shut.

	Louis looks again at Lestat. He snatches the cloth from
	Lestat's hand. We see it is a small torn bloodstained
	dress. Claudia's dress.

	The door bangs again. Estelle laughs. Rain gusts into
	the ballroom.

	Louis goes to the door, holding the dress. Armand
	approaches, trying to pull him away, but Louis shrugs
	him off. He draws nearer and nearer and stairs at -


	INT. BRICK AIRWELL

	On the stones lie Claudia and Madeleine, burn to ashes,
	in each other's arms, like the corpses of his wife and
	daughter in the New Orleans graveyard, embracing each
	other.

	Only Claudia's blond hair and Madeleine's red hair
	remain unburnt.

	Louis looks up at the walls of this airwell, many
	stories to the sky. He cries out in agony.

	Santiago appears behind him, staring. Louis roars in
	horror and attacks Santiago, scattering the ashes into
	the rainy wind. Claudia's golden locks fly up into the
	wind, they whirl around the warring figure.

	Armand appears, drags Louis free, pulls him screaming
	from the airwell, into the ballroom, towards the exit.

	Claudia's hair is sucked up by the wind through the
	airwell, towards the night sky.


	EXT. NOTRE DAME DOOR - NIGHT

	Louis is slumped against the stone wall. Armand stands
	beside him like a guardian angel.

				ARMAND
		I couldn't prevent it.

				LOUIS
		I don't believe you. I do not have
		to read your soul to know that you
		lie.

				ARMAND
		Louis, they cannot be brought back.
		There are some things that are
		impossible, even for me.

				LOUIS
		You let them do it.

	Louis climbs to his feet.

				LOUIS
		You held sway over them. They
		feared you. You wanted it to
		happen.

				ARMAND
		Louis, I swear I did not.

				LOUIS
		I understand you only too well. You
		let them do it, as I let Lestat
		turn a child into a demon. As I let
		her rip Lestat's heart to pieces!
		Well I am no longer that passive
		fool that has spun evil from evil
		till the web traps the one who made
		it. Your melancholy spirit of this
		century! I know what I must do. And
		I warn you - you saved me tonight,
		so I return the favor - do not go
		near your cell in the Theatre Des
		Vampires again.


	EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - DAWN

	Wet and deserted, the streets around the theatre are
	quiet.


	CLOSEUP - CLOCK

	Chiming five a.m.


	CLOSE ON LOUIS

	Looking at the paling sky. He is in an alleyway,
	outside of Armand's cell. He has a huge keg with him.
	he finds the door unlocked. He enters.


	INT. CELL

	Empty. The hearth is cold. The old coffin is gone.
	Louis silently closes the door to the passage and
	blocks it with an immense bar. He goes in the other
	door.


	INT. THEATRE

	Louis hurls kerosene all over the stage, the curtain,
	the sets, the seats below. He grabs the scythe from the
	playlet. He walks out. Dribbling a trail of kerosene
	behind him.


	INT. STAIRS

	Louis walking rapidly down, leaving the trail of
	kerosene. He creeps quietly into the -


	BALLROOM

	Leaking kerosene from the cask. He splashes over the
	coffins that gleam in the dimness.

	Then he strikes a match and heaves it into the
	kerosene. Everything bursts into flame. The trail of
	kerosene roars into fire through the ballroom over the
	coffins and up the stairs. We hear EXPLOSIONS of fire
	from above.


	LOUIS

	Shudders all over, fighting the morning weakness. He
	readies the scythe, like the grim reaper.


	ESTELLE

	Rises from her burning coffin, screams and tries to run
	through the fire but Louis slashes her down with the
	scythe and she goes down screaming, her dress in
	flames.

				ESTELLE
		Stop him. It's morning. The
		sunlight. Stop him.

	Others rise, choking in the smoke. Screams from
	everywhere. They are burning.

	Louis backs up the stairs to the -


	DUNGEON

	He can see there a thin pale light under Armand's
	bolted door. Suddenly -


	SANTIAGO

	Comes at him from behind. Louis turns. Santiago rushes
	him in a blur. Louis swings the scythe, too fast to see
	what he himself is doing. Santiago's head streaming
	blood flies through the air.

	The body drops, flapping its arms.

	SCREAMS come from everywhere.

	Another vampire rushes burning towards Louis. He
	decapitates him in turn. Then he staggers into Armand's
	cell, and bars the door the connects it to the ballroom
	behind him. He staggers to the outer door. There is a
	thin strip of daylight, beneath the door, blinding him.
	He throws it open, and staggers into the daylight.


	EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - DAWN

	Louis staggers out of the burning theatre, into the
	thin daylight. Great gusts of smoke cover the street.
	He staggers through the daylight, weakening, about to
	fall, when through the clouds of smoke comes -


	A MAGNIFICENT HEARSE

	As in a dream, driven by Armand's human boy. The door
	of the hearse opens. Through the curtains enclosing the
	interior, we see Armand. He reaches a hand out to Louis
	and pulls him inside.

	The hearse vanishes through the smoke, leaving the
	spectacle of the burning theatre.


	EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - TWILIGHT

	The gutted Theatre and ballroom, the roof collapsed,
	exposed to the evening sky. The life of Paris goes on
	around it, oblivious.


	INT. LOUVRE - NIGHTS LATER

	It is already a museum by this time and Louis and
	Armand, fancily dressed and composed, walk through it.
	They stop by a Gericault - The Wreck of the Medusa.

				LOUIS
		You didn't even warm them, did you?

				ARMAND
		No.

				LOUIS
		And yet you knew what I would do.

				ARMAND
		I knew. I rescued you, didn't I?
		From the terrible dawn.

				LOUIS
		You were their leader. They trusted
		you.

				ARMAND
		You made me see their failings,
		Louis. You made me look at them
		with your eyes.

	He looks at Louis affectionately.

				ARMAND
		Your melancholy eyes...

				LOUIS
		What a pair we are. We deserve each
		other, don't we?

				ARMAND
		We are a pair, and that's what
		counts.

	Armand and Louis walk slowly through the Louvre
	together. Camera follows them for a while, then comes
	to rest on a sunrise by Turner.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		We left Paris shortly after. For
		years we wandered. Greece, Egypt,
		all the ancient lands. Then, out of
		curiosity, perhaps, boredom, who
		knows what, I took him home, to my
		America...


	INT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

	A deco cinema of the twenties. Louis and Armand,
	dressed in the style of the period walk down the aisle
	through the crowded seats.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		And there, a technological wonder
		allowed me see sunrise, for the
		first time in two hundred years...

	On the screen, Murnau's "Sunrise", in black and white.
	We see a montage of sunrises, from a whole range of
	movies, in black and white.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		And what sunrises! Seen as the
		human eye could never see them. We
		would sit in the dark, night after
		night among nameless humans,
		entranced with the miracle of
		light. Silver at first, then as the
		years progressed in tones of
		purple, red and my long-lost
		blue...

	The SUNRISES continue, in color now, and the
	backgrounds in them change to the fifties.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		And in time parted. We had become
		so alike, we both wanted the
		certainties of loneliness once
		more.

	The lights come up in a different theatre. Louis
	sitting there, alone, in a half empty theatre, dressed
	in the clothes of the fifties. He rises, exits with the
	others.


	EXT. NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT

	Cars rushing by, twentieth-century madness. Louis
	emerges from the theatre, walks through the streets.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		I had returned to new Orleans. As
		soon as I smelt the air, I knew I
		was home. There was sadness there,
		rich, almost sweet, like the
		fragrance of jasmine. I walked the
		streets, savoring it like a long
		lost perfume...


	EXT. GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT

	Louis walks past the many Greek Revival Mansions.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		And then on Prytania Street, only
		blocks from the Lafayette cemetery
		I caught the scent of death and it
		wasn't coming from the graves...

	CAMERA PANS OVER white-walled Lafayette cemetery and
	its surrounding mansions.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		The scent grew stronger as I
		walked. Old death. A scent too
		faint for mortals to detect.

	Louis sees rats darting across the street. They rush
	into a great overgrown garden surrounding a ruined
	mansion. No lights.

	Louis stops at a rusted gate. He forces it open and
	enters -


	A VERITABLE JUNGLE

	Of overgrown rose and oak tree and wisteria. he sees a
	faint glimmer of light coming from a distant glass
	window of a huge Greek Revival house. He approaches
	then he sees -


	OLD SHRIVELLED CORPSE

	Of a man, long dead and dried up, snagged in the thorny
	rosevines.


	LOUIS

	Looks around. Walks on. Sees another corpse, almost
	nothing but bones, sinking into the wet earth, the
	roots of an oak overgrowing it.

	He looks up at the distant light.

	He passes a third corpse, caught in wisteria and rose
	vine, only bones and clothes.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		They were like the doomed princess
		caught in the thorny vines of
		Sleeping Beauty's castle. I knew
		what it meant. A vampire had lured
		them here, but had been to weak to
		get rid of them.

	Louis sees dead rats lying near the steps.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		It spelt weakness, madness, the
		behavior of a dying animal that
		pollutes its own lair.

	Louis treads carefully on the rotted steps. he moves
	along the porch. More dead rats. He sees through the
	floor-length window into rooms lined with stacked
	books. Virtually walled with them. Water seeps down
	from the ceiling, gleaming as it streaks over the
	books. The floors of the splendid rooms are bare,
	except for a rotten French chair by a dead fireplace. A
	single mirror reflecting the moon.

	Dead rats.

	He moves along the porch to the parlor windows. The
	candle flickers inside. He sees -


	HIS POV

	Lestat lying on the floor. He is gaunt to near
	starvation. All his scars are gone, but he is almost a
	skeleton and his eyes are enormous in their sockets.
	His clothes are rags. Blond hair beautiful, as always.


	MALLOY'S ENTRANCES FACE SUPERIMPOSED OVER

				MALLOY (V.O.)
		Lestat escaped the fire!

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		He hadn't even been there. And all
		those years I thought he was dead.


	BACK TO LESTAT

	One tiny candle stands beside him. He reads an early
	comic, from the turn of the century. Without turning
	his head, he speaks.

				LESTAT
		I'm so glad you're here Louis...
		I've dreamed of your coming...

				LOUIS
		Don't try to speak... it's
		alright...

				LESTAT
		I didn't mean to let them do it...
		that Santiago, he tricked me...

				LOUIS
		That's all past, Lestat.

				LESTAT
		Yes. Past... she should never have
		been one of us...

	He turns and looks at Louis. Old, fearful, broken.

				LESTAT
		Still beautiful Louis. You always
		were the strong one.

				LOUIS
		Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you
		no harm.

				LESTAT
		You've come back to me, Louis?
		You've come again to me?

	Louis shakes his head. A series of police sirens go by,
	piercing the night sky. A helicopter goes overhead. Red
	flashes illuminate his face. Lestat shivers, covers his
	ears. He's terrified. Louis touches him, calming him,
	until the lights pass over.

				LOUIS
		It's only a siren...

				LESTAT
		I can't bear it Louis! The machines
		out there, that fly and that roar!
		And such lights! They make the
		night brighter than the day!

				LOUIS
		And they frighten you?

				LESTAT
		You know I love the dark. But
		there's no dark anymore.

				LOUIS
		It's false light, Lestat. It can't
		harm you...

				LESTAT
		If you stayed with me Louis, I
		could venture out... little by
		little... become the old Lestat.

	Louis shivers. He releases him.

				LOUIS
		I have to go now Lestat...

				LESTAT
		You remember how I was, Louis.. the
		vampire Lestat...

				LOUIS
		Yes. I remember...

	Lestat shivers.

				LESTAT
		I tried to tell you Louis... that
		night in Paris... when I first came
		to you... no-one can refuse the
		dark gift, Louis... not even you.

				LOUIS
		I tried...

				LESTAT
		And the more you tried, the more I
		wanted you... a vampire with your
		beautiful, suffering human heart.
		And how you suffered... I need your
		forgiveness, Louis.

				LOUIS
		You have it...

	Louis walks slowly away from him. Lestat turns back to
	his candle, his magazine.

				LESTAT
		You'll come back, Louis... take me
		out... little by little... and
		maybe I'll be myself again...

	A bluebottle buzzes by him. His hand shoots out and
	grabs it, squeezes the blood.

				LOUIS
			(whispering)
		Yes, Lestat...


	ON LOUIS

	As he walks through the decayed house. His eyes are
	expressionless.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
		And my story ends there. But in
		fact it ended a long time ago, with
		Claudia's ashes in that theatre. My
		love died with her. I never really
		changed after that. What became of
		Lestat I have no idea. I go on,
		night after night. I feed on those
		who cross my path. But all my
		passion went with her yellow hair.
		I ma a spirit with preternatural
		flesh. Detached. unchangeable.
		Empty.


	INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT (PRESENT)

	Malloy, staring at Louis.

				MALLOY
		No... it can't end like that...

				LOUIS
		But it has. There is no more to
		tell.

				MALLOY
		But you talk about passion, about
		longing, about things I'll never
		know in my life! It's still inside
		you, in every syllable you speak!
		And then you tell me it ends like
		that? Just empty?

				LOUIS
		It's over, I'm telling you...

				MALLOY
		You need a new passion, Louis, a
		new reason to feel... what a story
		you've told, you don't understand
		yourself.

	Louis looks at the cassettes on the table.

				LOUIS
		Do what you want with it. Learn
		what you can. Give the story to
		others.

	Malloy rises.

				MALLOY
		You have another chance, Louis.
		Take me! Give me your gift, your
		power...

	Louis is slowly horrified, then outraged and angry.

				LOUIS
		Is this what you want? You ask me
		for this after all I've told you?

				MALLOY
		If I could see what you've seen,
		feel what you've felt I wouldn't
		let it end like this! You need a
		like to the world out there, a
		connection... then it won't end
		like this...

	He stares at Louis.

				MALLOY
		You need me.

	Louis turns away.

				LOUIS
		Dear God. I've failed again,
		haven't I?

				MALLOY
		No...

				LOUIS
		Don't say anymore. The reels are
		still turning. I have but one
		chance to show you the meaning of
		what I've said.

	He looks at the boy. Then suddenly grabs him, lifts him
	off the floor, bares his terrifying fangs and brings
	them to his throat. Malloy screams, in involuntary
	terror.

				LOUIS
		You like it? You like being food
		for the immortals? You like dying?
		Is it beautiful? Is it intense?

	Malloy, now terrified, whispers

				MALLOY
		No... please...

	Louis drops him.

				LOUIS
		Thank God.

	Malloy, falls on the floor, terrified. When he looks
	up, Louis has vanished.

				MALLOY
		Louis... Louis...

	He looks up at the tape. It is still turning.

				MALLOY
		Holy shit...

	He shakes his head. He gets up, and with shaking
	fingers gathers his tapes. He runs out of the room.


	EXT. STREET OUTSIDE - NIGHT

	Malloy running for his car, a convertible. He leaps in
	and screeches off through the night.


	EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

	Malloy whips the car through the tiny streets, in
	sheer, unfocused terror.

				MALLOY
		Jesus...


	EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT

	Malloy driving with streams of traffic over the bridge.
	He breathes deeply, to calm himself. He takes a tape
	from his pocket, and with still shaking hands, sticks
	it in the deck.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
			(tape)
		1791. That's when it happened. I
		was twenty-four. Younger then you
		are now.

	Suddenly a bony hand shoots out from the back seat,
	pulls his neck backwards -


	LESTAT

	Sinks his teeth in his neck.


	MALLOY'S HANDS

	On the wheel, shaking, shuddering, losing their grip.


	MALLOY'S EYES

	Bulging, as the life drains out of him. Lestat sucking
	him like a rat.


	THE WHEEL

	Swinging free of Malloy's dying hands.


	THE CAR

	Veers wildly into oncoming traffic.


	LESTAT

	Drinks regardless.


	A TRUCK

	Coming towards them, about to crush the car.


	LESTAT'S BONY HAND

	Grabs the wheel, jerks it as he drinks.


	THE CAR

	Misses the truck by inches.


	LESTAT

	Throws Malloy to one side, climbs into the front seat.

	The tape is playing.

				LOUIS (V.O.)
			(tape)
		My invitation was open to anyone.
		Sailors, whores, thieves. But it
		was a vampire that accepted...


	ON LESTAT

	At the wheel, the corpse of Malloy in the passenger
	seat. He smiles. We can see the blood renewing him.

				LESTAT
		Dear Louis... will I ever forget?


	EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT

	Lestat drives on, the car a tiny speck against the
	bridge, the sea, the sky beyond, with the first fingers
	of light spreading through it.

									 FADE OUT



	THE END
JASON X - Revised Rough Draft

 
	JASON-X
	BY TOD FARMER
	REVISED ROUGH DRAFT
	MAY 24, 1999

	FADE IN:

	DARKNESS.

	A scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we SHOCK CUT INTO -

	MONTAGE of fast moving clips.  Death, destruction, fear.  All images 
	taken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths.  

	AGAIN, DARKNESS.

								OPEN ON:

	The year is 2455. The place is Old Earth. Barren, void of life, a 
	hazardous and violent planet. The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of 
	dark gray.  It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign.

	BLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM 
	below. 

	Small groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work 
	nearby. Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings 
	with strange devices.

	This is an archeological expedition.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  DARK PLACE

	The dust storm rages outside. Two figures are looking closely at a small 
	object buried in the dirt. One of them pulls a device out of their pouch 
	and slowly, gently picks up the object. The other uses a magnetic tool 
	to remove the dirt.

				FEMALE VOICE
		Careful . . .

				MALE VOICE
		I know.

	They take off their masks and goggles. They are both young. ADRIENNE 
	female (17) watches as STONEY male (18) studies the object closely.

				STONEY
			(reading)
		Not guaranteed, if used After 2198.

	CLOSE UP of the object. It's an unopened condom.

				ADRIENNE
			(smiles)
		You thinking what I'm thinking?

	Stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open 
	the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	They are in a half buried mini-van.  It rocks violently from the raging 
	storm outside and from the raging lust inside.

	BACK INSIDE THE VAN.

				ADRIENNE
			(breathless)
		What about Kkinsa?

	STONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra.

				STONEY
		It's over between us. You're the
		only one for me!

	METAL SCREECHES! THE FLOOR COLLAPSES!

	They fall some ten feet, RUBBLE RAINING down on top of them.

	INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

	A rusty metal ladder. Debris everywhere. Half inch layers of dust cover 
	everything. Dead. Lifeless.

				STONEY
		You okay?

	Adrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. She 
	turns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder.

	SHE SCREAMS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM.

	We PULL BACK, out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the 
	storm drown out ADRIENNE'S SCREAM.

								CUT TO:
	EXT.  BASE CAMP

	The digging and readings have stopped. A group approaches a time scarred 
	shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly.

	FAT LOU (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of 
	the shuttle ramp.

				FAT LOU
			(yelling over the wind)
		Let's go! Time to load up!

	YLLO(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil. 

				YLLO
			(yelling)
		I'm missing two!

				FAT LOU
		Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have
		left this rock an hour ago!

				BOEMAN
			(eyes a device)
		North three clicks.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MINI-VAN - DAY

	YLLO and the rest of the group run into view. BOEMAN (18), husky, 
	physical; holds out a device and checks the reading.

	He points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly.

				BOEMAN
			(yelling)
		There!

	KICKER(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic 
	military garb -

				KICKER
		Yo, Teach, what the fuck?

				YLLO
		We're missing two of the kids!

				KICKER
		Get your ass back to the shuttle.
		I'll check it out.

	KICKER moves past the group and into the Van.

				YLLO
		Not without me!

	The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van.

	INT. ANCIENT CORRIDOR

	YLLO and the others climb down a rusted ladder. Metallic walls, 
	graffiti, cluttered floors. No Stoney or Adrienne. A sign from the 
	ceiling states -

	CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY.

	They all take off the goggles and masks. The rest of the group consists 
	of DELONGPRE(18) good looking, smart ass; JANESSA(17) sexual, scheming 
	AZRAEL(17) SMALL, COCKY; KKINSA(16), insecure, problematic; 
	THORGAN(17), a nerd but doesn't know it.

				YLLO
		Amazing! But, how . . I've been coming
		here for ten years. We never picked this up on
		our . . . KAY-EM?

	KAY-EM 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil. She's 
	gorgeous, but there's something off about her look. Something synthetic.

				KAY-EM 14
		The air's laced with type two ozone,
		it reads as a solid.

				THORGAN
		Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.

				KAY-EM 14
		In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved
		their facilities underground to escape . . .

				KICKER
		All right, all right, enough with the history
		lesson. Lets find these two quick . . so I can kick
		some little punk ass.

	Kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.

				KKINSA
		I have an idea, why don't you go find
		them and we'll get the hell out of here!

	KKINSA turns and finds herself face to face with - -

	A CORPSE! Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled 
	through the forehead by an iron spike. 

	KKINSA SCREAMS!

	Kicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as 

	JANESSA falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. She screams! 

	KAY-EM 14 SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Everyone looks at the droid.

				KAY-EM 14
		Was that out loud?

				DELONGPREE
		Thorgan, have you been screwing with . . .

	THORGAN grabs the head off the CORPSE, with the spike through it's head.

				THORGAN
		Cool! This is an automatic "A".

	Azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some 
	cds, and an ancient box of PLAYTEX . . . starts shoving the corpse into 
	his pack.
				AZRAEL
		I've got my project. What are you losers
		gonna do?

				KICKER
		Back to the shuttle! All of you!
		I'll find them.

				YLLO
		Relax, Soldier boy, this is amazing.
		These remains are two hundred years old.

	Yllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling. DANGER. STAY OUT.

				BOEMAN
		Creepy.

				THORGAN
		Cool.

				KKINSA
		Okay, I'm outta here.

				YYLO
		Kay-Em, any thoughts?

				KAY-EM 14
		Girth is better than length and
		women prefer a shaved scrotum during
		oral sex.

	Yllo glares a Thorgan.

				THORGAN
		I'm trying to give her some personality.

				YLLO
		Well stop messing with her. I don't want
		a science droid with a personality. Now
		let's find them and get back. I want to
		get clearance to stay back and study this . . .

				KKINSA
		No way! I'm not staying here any longer . . .
		I have a life you know.

	A radio crackles.

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze!
		Get your ass back hre!

				YLLO
			(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it.
		You won't believe what we found.
			(calls out)
		Adrienne! Stoney!

	Yllo rushes past the corpse. The others reluctantly follow. They pass 
	another hanging sign - Danger - THEY PASS ANOTHER CORPSE LYING ON THE 
	FLOOR, it's torso separated from it's legs. And this is just the 
	beginning. As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.

				BOEMAN
		There was a hall of a battle down here.

	S they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. A WARNING 
	VOICE sounds.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Dan-danger. Do not enter-er.

	But the group keeps moving. 

				KKINSA
		I feel compelled to ask why we are
		ignoring that.

	A corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a 
	warning written in ancient blood . . .

	HELP ME . . .

	Suddenly another CORPSE LEAPS at them, screaming like a banshee! 
	Everyone SCREAMS - It lands on Kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get 
	the corpse off her. 

	DELONGPREE and YLLO help Kkinsa fight the rotting corpse. They hear 
	hysterical laughter and look up to see -

	ADRIENNE and STONEY . . . emerge from the shadows laughing 
	uncontrollably.

				DELONGPREE
		Damnit!

				YLLO
		What the hell are you two doing?!

	Kkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney.

				KKINSA
		You're toast, mister.

				YLLO
		You're both toast!

				ADRIENNE
		You gotta see this!

	They turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of 
	a jumbled mess of jagged metal.

				THORGAN
			(re: ceiling)
		That's a strange design, don't you think?

				KICKER
		We don't have time for this shit.

	As they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and 
	squeeze together. That can't be a good thing . . .

	STONEY and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door. Above the door . . . 
	CRYOGENICS LAB.

	Adrienne points to a small window in the door.

				DELONGPREE
		Yeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year.

				ADRIENNE
		Check it out.

	With a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in 
	the door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning -

	A SKULL AND CROSSBONES 

				KKINSA
		So don't open the door.

				ADRIENNE
		Look beyond it, yesterday's news.

	Yllo pushes his way to the window.

	Shocked faces.

	INSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's 
	massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled 
	up into a ball, is a body - female, young.

				YLLO
		Is that?

				KAY-EM 14
		The room's still operational.
		She's perfectly preserved.

	Yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio.

				YLLO
			(into radio)
		Fat Lou, bring the ship to the
		following coordinates. Call Grendel,
		have them power up the labs, we're bringing
		in the find of the century!

				KICKER
		Now wait a minute! I don't think you
		should open that door.

				YLLO
		This is a science excursion corporal.
		Just stay out of the way.

	Yllo turns to the kids. He's very excited.

				YLLO
		Okay, no screwing around. This is the real
		thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, 
		open it up.

	Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.

				KKINSA
		You're opening the door?
		What about the . . . ?

	She points to the skull and crossbones. 

				DELONGPREE
		I'm thinking we should call in some
		experts.

				YLLO
		This is your find people. You want to
		give your credit away?

				DELONGPREE
		I was just saying . . .

				THORGAN
		The cryo unit leaked. The computers
		sealed the room. No airborne viruses
		no hazardous materials. I've shut down the
		until. Alright, stand back. 

				KAY-EM 14
		Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses
		will render you unconcious.

				DELONGPREE
		Knock you on your ass pal. 

	They don their face masks as  . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door 
	cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes 
	with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice 
	crystals crack and fall to the floor.

	EXT.  CRYO CELL

				YLLO
		Kay-Em!

	Kay moves into the room ahead of the others.

	INT.  CRYO CELL

	CLOSE ON KAY-EM'S EYES

	They are not human. Mechanical, digital, but alluring. They dilate, open 
	up. Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the 
	body.

	--which itself is slumped over. An icicle of frozen blood from, the 
	wound in her shoulder, props the body up.

	The other enter the icy chamber.

				DELONGPREE
		I speak on behalf of the group
		when I say . . . that's fucked.

				KAY-EM 14
		Female, nineteen years old, eight months . . .
		34-26-34 . . . bitch is built like a brick
		shit house.

				YLLO
		Thorgan?!!!

				THORGAN
		Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back.

				KAY-EM 14
		Time of hibernation 2049.
		Crystallization at seventeen percent.
		Suggest extensive Nanotech. Chances of
		rejuvenation eight-one percent.

				KKINSA
		What's going on?

				DELONGPREE
		She's dying.

				JANESSA
		Bitch looks dead to me.

	The RADIO CRACKLES . . .

				SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Yllo, Sergeant Brodski. Get your ass
		back to the shuttle!!

				YLLO
		Janessa, stretcher.
			(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on, sergeant. We have
		a medical emergency here not tot mention the
		discovery of a lifetime.

				SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Kicker! Get them the hell out of there!

	Janessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a 
	flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground.

	Kicker grabs Yllo.

				KICKER
		We're outta here!

	Yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of 
	blood and -CRACK-breaks it off.

				YLLO
		Fine, grab that end.


	Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled 
	body on the stretcher.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit -

				THORGAN
		Hey check this out!

	Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete.

				THORGAN
		This caused the leak and there's an
		occupant. 

	Thorgan yanks the door open.

				KICKER
		Don't touch that!

	Gas rolls out. Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE.

				KKINSA
		This is bad, no?

				THORGAN
		Relax, it's only a  glitch in the
		system. 

				JANESSA
		First field trip and you think
		you're a Scientist. Move out of the
		way geek. 

	JANESSA moves to look inside the chamber. 

	As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE, see a 
	jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. A chunk 
	of ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES 
	looms forward!

	JANESSA screams as JASON'S BODY, stiff as a board, CRASHES to the ground 
	sending ice shrapnel everywhere!

				DELONGPREE
		Jesus, used to make the suckers big
		didn't they?

	Again, Kay-Em's eyes scan the frozen body.

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject was dead prior to incubation.

	Yllo moves to get a good look at Jason.

				YLLO
		My God, look at him. Why would they freeze
		a dead body?
			(a beat)
		Alright, load him up, and let's get out
		of here!

	OVER HIS SHOULDER - HALL

	A pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor.

	BACK INSIDE 

	One of Boeman's gadgets starts to BEEP.

				BOEMAN
		Er, guy? I'm picking up some movement.

	FZZZZT . . . Azrael screams as a laser slices into the room. His left 
	arm falls to the ground!

	Kay-Em rushes to him. Her finger pops open. A needle appears. She 
	injects him. The drugs take immediate effect.

				AZRAEL
		Cool . . . check out my arm.

	CLINK - CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

	HALL

	The metallic spiders, lasers attached to their bodies, CLANK towards our 
	heroes. 

				YLLO
		Kicker!

				KICKER
		Defense droids. I'm on it.

	Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.


				KKINSA
		There goes prom night.

	Kicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm.

				KICKER
		They're only class two. I can
		handle this. No problem.

				AZRAEL
		Not a problem?!

	Kay-Em injects him again.

				AZRAEL
		I'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr-
			(re:shot)
		Oh, that's dreamy.

	The lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges.

				JANESSA
		Okay rent-a-cop, do your shit.
		I gotta date tonight.

				KICKER
		Stand back!

	He pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons.

				YLLO
		We have to get these two back in one piece!

	Kay-Em turns to the frozen girl.

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject is critical. Needs nano stabilization
		immediately.

				YLLO
		Kicker! Do something!

				ADRIENNE
		Oh Gawd! I wish it would stop doing that.

	At her feet, Azrael's arm twitches spastically.

				AZRAEL
			(drugged up)
				That is soooo cool!

	Kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget.

	KAFOOM!

				KICKER
				Come on!

	Kicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids 
	follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear 
	around the bend - towards the exit.

	A beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view. Behind them - -

	CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

	A dozen laser wielding spiders make chase! Some are old and rusty, other 
	slump over and short out, but those that work . . . work well.

	INT.  LONG CORIDOOR

	Kicker is running backwards, BLASTING with his weapon. Lasers FLASHING 
	all around our group. 


				KKINSA
		Have I told you guys how much I hate this class?

				KICKER
		We need another exit! I'll hold 'em off!
		Teach, find a way out!

				BOEMAN
		I'm on it!

				KICKER
		Sorry kid, leave this to the pros.

				BOEMAN
			(re: gadget)
		Left at the end of the hall!

	A laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice.

				THORGAN
			(reading from device)
		They're not after us. Their sensors are
		locked in on . . . him!

	Thorgan points to JASON'S STRETCHER.

				KICKER
		Leave him behind!

				YLLO
		No! He's coming with us!

	They round a corner . . .

				BOEMAN
		Here. We're one meter from the surface!

				KICKER
		Then duck.

	CHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling.

	KABLOOM!! Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above.

				DELONGPREE
		It's too high!

	Kicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting!

				KICKER
		Make it happen!

				JANESSA
		They're just subclass B droids.
		I'm so not impressed.

				BOEMAN
		Stoney, you catch.

	Stonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very 
	acrobatic move.

	Boeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step. He begins tossing his 
	friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall!

	Soon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left.

				BOEMAN
		We're clear! Let's go!

	Boeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety. 
	He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker.

	Kicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand. Boeman strains to pull him up as 
	spider's cover the floor below them, then -

	A spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's 
	thigh. He screams.

				KICKER
		They've got me! Let go!

				BOEMAN
		No!

	Boeman ROARS and pulls harder. Kicker's pack RIPS from his body - the 
	spiders falling with the pack.

	EXT. SURFACE - DAY

	The sand storm is raging on the surface. Kicker lands on top of Boeman.

				BOEMAN
		That wasn't so bad.

	Kicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole.

				KICKER
			(yells)
		This will be!

	The others dive for the ground as -  - 

	KAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole!

				THORGAN
		Nice touch.

				BOEMAN
		And you said high school was boring.

	Our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle.

	FAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers.

				FAT LOU
		Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .

				YLLO
		Just get us to the ship!

	Azrael stops in a panic!

				AZRAEL
		Oh shit I forgot my arm!

				ADRIENNE
		Here. Dumbass.

	She hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp.

	The door closed, the SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and soars into the 
	sky.

								CUT TO:

	EXT.  ORBIT AROUND OLD EARTH - LATE

	THE SHUTTLE maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit. Old 
	satellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Navigating through the debris, FAT LOU grabs a radio mike.

				FAT LOU
		This is Beowulf approaching from
		sector fifteen.

	Through the front windshield we see - - 

	GRENDEL, a class IV Catamaran Transport. It looks like two huge 
	torpedoes attached by three thin walkways. Not new, but by no means old.

				BERNIE(V.O.)
		I've got you, Beowulf. Proceed with docking.
		And by the way, Brodski's pissed.

	INT.  DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle doors open revealing SERGEANT BRODSKI and six E-X GRUNTS 
	standing with weapons at the ready.

	As the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two 
	stretchers, Brodski stepsi n front of YLLO.

				BRODSKI
		What the hell were you thinking?

	YLLO ignores him, turns to his team.

				YLLO
		Get them in the lab!

				BRODSKI
		Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.

	The E-X Grunts step in front of kids.

				YLLO
			(to the grunts)
		Back off!

				YLLO
			(back to the kids)
		Get them to the labs . . . Now!

	The team moves through the Grunts.

				YLLO
		What the hell are you doing?

	Brodski looks down at the stretcher with the young woman's body on it.

				BRODSKI
		My god! This is way over your head, pal.
		We need to call some experts and . . .

				YLLO
		I am an expert!

				BRODSKI
		You're a teacher.

				YLLO
		Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me.
		She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab,
		she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking
		head!

				BRODSKI
		What if they're carrying? Did you even check?

				KAY-EM 14
		Subjects scan virus clean . . .

	Brodski attempts to shove Kay-Em out of his way . . . BUT she stands her 
	ground . . . grabs his crotch.

				KAY-EM 14
		Mmm, you like the rough stuff don't you, big boy?

	Brodski and Yllo look at Thorgan.

				BRODSKI AND YLLO
		Thorgan!!

				THORGAN
		Sorry . . . I'll fix her . . . I promise.

				BRODSKI
		How do you know that piece of cursed rock down
		there doesn't carry something metal tits can't
		detect?

				YLLO
		Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.

				BRODSKI
		Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.

				YLLO
		I don't give a shit. This one's prime for
		decryonization. We're brining her back.

				BRODSKI
		I still think we should send for a team of
		real scientists.

				YLLO
		I am a scientist you asshole! This could be
		the most important discovery in 400 years. Do
		you have any idea what a find like this could
		mean?

				BRODSKI
		Right now, I care only for the safety of this
		crew. You don't know anything about these two -

	The stretcher with JASON moves by them. Brodski looks down.

				BRODSKI
		Jesus what the hell is that?

				YLLO
		That's exactly what we need to find out.
		Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you
		where discovery is concerned. Now step aside.
		I have a medical emergency to deal with.

	Reluctantly, Brodski steps aside. As the kids follow, Azrael bumps into 
	DALLAS, one of the E-X GRUNTS. Azrael glares at him, brandishing the 
	severed limb.

				AZRAEL
		Watch it punk, I'm armed.

				DALLAS
		Punk?

	Dallas slaps Azrael across the back of the head as he passes.

				AZRAEL
		You'll pay for that.

	Dallas and the grunts laugh.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

	FAT LOU and BERNIE, a synthetic pilot existing only from the waist up in 
	his pilot's chair, set course for home.

				BERNIE
		Gravitation nominal. Thrusters engaged.

		Copy that, Grendel. Computer ovverides deployed.
		See you in two days.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LABS

	Dark, quiet, until the lights glare on.

	LAB ONE doubles as a Medical Research center and Sick Bay. GLASS JARS 
	filled with some of the strangest creatures ever seen cover the back 
	wall.

	Yllo and the students bring the girl in. Their movements are hurried and 
	economical . . .but they're excited.

				YLLO
		Get her prepped for the soup.
			(to Adrienne)
		Take the other one to lab two.

				ADRIENNE
		Yllo, this is my find. My project.
		I want to be in here.

				YLLO
		I know, dear, but this is too big a 
		discovery. I need you to prep the second
		body.

				ADRIENNE
		But, I want . . .

				YLLO
		This is a discovery that we will all share.
		We have to work as  a team. Now go. Stoney
		go with her.

	Thorgan and Delongpre lift the Girl onto the rejuvenation table.

	Stoney whispers something to Kkinsa before he exits with Adrienne.

	Kkkinsa nods and wheels a huge SCANNING MACHING over to the Girl. She 
	starts the scan as Delongpree and Thorgan cut the clothes off their 
	"find".

				THORGAN
		Have I told you guys how much I love this class?

	Delongpree brushes some of the melting crystals from her face.

				DELONGPREE
		She's beautiful . . .

	Thorgan cuts her shirt off.

				THORGAN
		Damn! Talk about your hard nipples.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne and Stoney push Jason into the lab.

	LAB TWO is smaller and less high-tech than LAB one. They shove JASON'S 
	body onto the EXAM TABLE. 

				ADRIENNE
		Fucking Yllo! Thinks he can push me aside.
		This is my find!

	She removes chucks of ice from JASON'S FACE.

				STONEY
		You know even though we both found this guy ,
		I'll let you take the credits. You can take it 
		from here.

				ADRIENNE
		Oh thanks . . . fine go. It's just another
		dissection. You'll only get in my way.

				STONEY
		Cool. Besides, you're into this shit.

	Stoney leaves Adrienne alone with Jason . . . and he is THAWING.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo walks around the room, overseeing all the action. He's excited and 
	cocky.

				YLLO
		Hands on training is rare. You should consider
		yourself lucky.

				AZRAEL
		Lucky?!

	Azrael sits in a large machine. This is . . .

	The NANO-TECH 2000. It can repair non-fatal injuries with the use of 
	Nano-Technology. 

	Azrael is scanned by the NT-2000 and so is his injury. It goes into 
	action as articulated mechanics begin to re-attach his arm.

				AZRAEL
		Another hour and I'd have lost
		the arm.

				JANESSA
		Oh, was that the hand you beat off with?

				AZRAEL
		I better get extra credit for this shit.

				YLLO
		Delongpree, Status. How you doing?

	Delongpree cuts her underpants from her body and tosses them over his 
	shoulder.

				DELONGPREE
			(swallows hard)
		I'm Okay.

				STONEY
		Well she's definitely a blond.

				JANESSA
		Oh that's scientific.

				DELONGPREE
		You think all girls from the past
		looked this good?

				JANESSA
		She's not that great.

				THORGAN
		400 years . . . I bet she'll be horny.

				YLLO
		Okay, people, we need to Learn everything
		there is to learn about our two guests. And
		if all goes well, I'll mention each one of
		you when I make my nobel prize speech.

				DELONGPREE
			(underbreath)
		Yeah, right.

	Delongpre presses a button on the table. The edges of the table RISE UP 
	to create a clear dome around the table. A hot gel-like substance shoots 
	out of small tubes. The FROZEN BODY is covered in the NANO-GEL.

	Thorgan checks a monitor.

				THORGAN
		Everything looks good.

	Yllo smiles - gushing self-satisfaction.

				YLLO
		Turn up the heat.

	Adrienne is wearing a metal eyepiece while staring at a computer screen. 
	No hands. 

				ADRIENNE
		Done. Crystallization remains
		seventeen percent.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne scans Jason with a machine identical to the one Kkinsa was 
	using in LAB ONE.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Crystallization at sixty percent
		Subject classification . . . deformity.

				ADRIENNE
		Put it on the screen.

	A monitor lights up with a scan of Jason's body. The internal organs are 
	distorted and bloated. She keys into the next lab. 

	Back to lab one.

				ADRIENNE(V.O.)
			(over speaker)
		Guys, check out beef-cakes scan.

	Jason's 3-D scan appears on one of the big monitors.

				ADRIENNE(V.O.)
		Look at the brain.

	Within Jason's skull is a brain the size of a golf-ball.

				JANESSA
		It's just like Thorgan's.
		What do you think this means?

	Thorgan grabs his crotch.

				THORGAN
		This is what it means right here.

				JANESSA
		Small brains make your balls itch?

				DELONGPRE
		And what's with the headgear?

				KAY-EM 14
		The mask is an artifact from a
		sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.

				BOEMAN
		Hockey.

				KAY-EM 14
		A medieval sport where two teams
		club one another with elongated
		sticks. Very sexy.

				YLLO
		What do you expect from a culture that
		sucked its planet dry of resources.

	She eyes Stoney. He smiles knowingly.

				KKINSA
		This bores me.

				DELONGPRE
		She's red. Body temp 98.6. This
		is so cool.

				YLLO
		Prep defib and start the cell 
		reconstruction.

	KAY-EM 14 presses a series of buttons. A long needle punctures the 
	GIRL'S NECK. Jason's scan is replaced by the girl's. We see 
	Nanotechnology going to work replacing her wounds and damaged cells.

				THORGAN
		Cool!

	Kkinsa and Stoney back out of the room unnoticed.

				YLLO
		Is she stable?

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject is stable and cell
		reconstruction has begun.

				DELONGPRE
		Now what?

				YLLO
		We wait. I need about fifteen.
		Call me if there are any changes.
		If she farts I want a full report.

				AZRAEL
		Don't I deserve a sick day or some
		shit like that?

	Yllo exits.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	The door swishes open. Stoney enters with Kkinsa close behind. Kkinsa 
	raises her hand.

				KKINSA
		Adrienne?! Of all people!

				STONEY
		You're jealous.

	Stoney moves back. Kkinsa moves close hand raises above her head.

				KKINSA
		Adrienne?!

				STONEY
		It's over between us. You're the
		one I want.

	Kkinsa grabs the back of her shirt and pulls it over her head.

				KKINSA
		Bed!

	A bed slides out from the wall, hitting Stoney in the back of the legs, 
	causing him to fall on the bed. Kkinsa straddles him. Stoney grabs her. 
	The two fall into a feverish kiss.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne is prepping various medical tools. JASON'S BODY is laying on an 
	autopsy table. Steam rises from his body as thick ooze drips from his 
	thawing flesh.

	She turns on a computer monitor.

				ADRIENNE 
		Prepare organ vats.

	Two metal sinks hiss as liquid nitrogen flows.

				ADRIENNE
		Okay big boy . . . 

	She picks up a long, sharp chrome tool and walks over to Jason's body.

				ADRIENNE
			(continuing)
		. . . let's see what you're made of.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

	Yllo enters and approaches a computer console. The door behind him 
	opens. Janessa enters.

				JANESSA
		All this science shit, makes me horny.
			(removes her shirt)
		Take off your cloths, we don't have much
		time.

	She drops her shirt to the floor. Yllo retrieves it, hands it back.

				JANESSA
		You're quicker than usual.

				YLLO
		Later.

				JANESSA
		You prefer an apple?

	He forces her into the hall, closes the door, locks it. He returns to 
	the console.

				YLLO

	A huge cylindrical ship, floats quietly. We hear a BEEPING sound.

	INT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - PEREZ QUARTERS

	Joshua Perez rolls over, clicks on a light. He fumbles for a button, 
	presses it. A wall monitor lights up revealing Yllo's face.

	INTERCUT AS NEEDED

				PEREZ
		You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?

				YLLO
		We just left old Earth. You'll never believe
		what we found.

	Yllo inserts a disk into the console.

				YLLO
		I'm sending you the files.

				PEREZ

		Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient

	She is inches away from his steaming mask. She taps it with her tool.

	She begins working at the straps of the mask, cutting the overgrown 
	flesh away.

	INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

	Yllo studies a monitor. On screen: a document entitled, EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS 
	OF DISCOVERY. He talks on the secure line.

				YLLO
		Hypothetically, how much are we talking?

				PEREZ(V.O.)
		If you're for real, you're looking at a million
		credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include
		touring and guest lectures. When can you get them
		here?

				YLLO
		I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?

				PEREZ(V.O.)
		See you then . . . doctor.

	Yllo's face glows with thoughts of fame and fortune.

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  HALL OUTSIDE YLLO'S QUARTERS

	Janessa has hooked up a small device to the door. She's heard every 
	word.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa rips off Stoney's shirt. Stoney grab her and rolls on top of her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	CLOSE ON JASON'S HAND - it curls, the frozen joints CRACKLE.

	Adrienne turns from Jason's mask. A large wad of goo hits the floor. She 
	turns back to her work. Slicing flesh away from the mask.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Stoney and Kkinsa kiss passionately as they wrestle to get each other's 
	pants off.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne tries to pry the Mask off . . . but it holds firm.

	She stick s a long sharp tool into an eye hole. We hear disgusting 
	noises as she probes JASON'S EYE SOCKET.

	She removes the tool, and on the end is Jason's eye!

	Holding it close she looks at it. It is bloated and distorted. She drops 
	it in a specimen jar and takes it over to her work station.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa rolls on top of Stoney. She holds his arms down as she whispers 
	in his ear.

				KKINSA
		How bad do you want it?

	Stoney gets his arms free and rolls on top of her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	JASON'S LEG JERKS!

	Adrienne turns again, then approaches.

				ADRIENNE
		Interesting. Record. Thawing has
		caused possible muscle spasms.

	She frowns at the disgusting ooze. A mixture of swamp waters, blood, and 
	other thawing bodily fluids, puddle around Jason's body.

	She moves back to her work station and picks up JASON'S BLOATED EYE. She 
	takes out an autopsy laser and cuts through the center of the eye.

	The laser slices through the fatty tissue as thick black goop drips out 
	of the eye. Adrienne stares into a microscope. This is all very 
	interesting.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Stoney lies on top of Kkinsa.

				KKINSA
		Yes . . . yes . . . that's it!

	. . . a moment, then both GASP as he enters her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	JASON sits up!

	CLOSE on ADRIENNE as she studies the dripping eye. She puts the laser 
	down and turns to the slab and freezes.

	JASON IS GONE!

	She spins around only to find Jason standing behind her. He grabs her by 
	the throat! She can't scream. She kicks wildly as he studies her.

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Delongpre, Boemen, Kay-Em 14 and Thorgan wait and watch girl in the 
	NANO-GEL. Thorgan is getting impatient. He can't find something.

				THORGAN
		Anybody seen the reticulator?

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne is thrown into a work light. The room goes dark. 

	INT.  LAB ONE

				DELONGPRE
		Try next door, there was one there
		yesterday.

	Thorgan exits.

	INT.  LAB TWO'S OBSERVATION ROOM

	The lights go. Thorgan looks around. Through the thick glass, where 
	JASON is killing Adrienne, is blackness.

				THORGAN
		Wakey wakey love birds . . . Yllo's
		gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling
		around instead of working.

	Thorgan roots through a drawer, his back to the glass.

	ANTE ROOM

	Through the glass beside him we see Adrienne screaming. But NO SOUND. 
	All rooms are air tight. Her head is smashed on the glass!

	Still screaming, her face recedes back into the darkness as Thorgan 
	looks over his shoulder.

				THORGAN
		Bye, lovebirds . . . Stoney, you dog.

	He exits.

	BACK TO JASON

	As he - -

	DUNKS Adrienne's head INTO ONE OF THE METAL SINKS. Her body goes limp. He 
	pulls her head up and stares at her frozen head, eyes open, mouth locked 
	in a scream.

	He thumps the head against a wall. IT SHATTERS! Jason drops the body 
	with a thud then turns to the - -

	DISSECTION TOOLS. He chooses a long silver cleaver.

	JASON'S BACK!

	EXT.  LAB ONE CORRIDOR

	Jason walks into the corridor from LAB TWO, steam still rising from his 
	cold body. He heads away from LAB ONE as soon as he's out of sight, YLLO 
	appears.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Delongpre wakes as Yllo enters.

				YLLO
		All right, lets do this. Thorgan
		begin the Defib program, Delongpre,
		ready the drainage units. Boerman get the
		others in here.

	Boeman grabs a wall mike.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa straddles Stoney.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		We've got a heartbeat!

	Her back arches in ecstasy.

				KKINSA
		No shit, we've got a heart beat!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Stoney, you copy? She's awake.
		You coming?

				STONEY
		Hell yeah I'm coming!

				KKINSA
		No . . . not yet!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Yes, right now!

				STONEY
		YES !!!

				KKINSA
		NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! YES!!!

				STONEY
		YES!!!!!!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Stoney, put your pants on and get
		your ass down here!

	They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door. Stoney hits the 
	door release and the door SWISHES open revealing - -

	JASON VOORHEES!

	Standing in the hall. He swings the silver cleaver.

	Stoney sidesteps as Kkinsa SCREAMS. Stoney SLAMS his palm into the door 
	panel. The door SWISHES to close but Jason's hand reaches out and stops 
	it.

	ENGINES WINE as JASON STRUGGLES to force the door open.

	Stoney keeps POUNDING the panel, trying to make the door close but 
	Jason's too strong!

	Jason grabs Stoney by the arm, jerks him into the doorway and releases 
	the door.

	The door closes! Splitting Stoney from forehead to crotch!

	Splashed with blood, Kkinsa falls to the floor cowering . . .
	mumbling nonsensically. 

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo, Janessa, Thorgan, Boemen and Delongpre anxiously huddle around the 
	Frozen Girl's body. Probes dangle in the gel.

				YLLO
		It's time.

				DELONGPRE
		What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?

				YLLO
		I've waited long enough.
		Kay . . . you know what to do.

	Kay presses buttons. We hear the whine of something powering up . . .

	Brodski enters the lab.

				YLLO
		What the hell are you doing?

				BRODSKI
		My job.

				YLLO
		Fine, just stay out of my way.
			(turns to Kay)
		Hit it. 

	An electrical noise flares THE SCREEN TO WHITE:

								SMASH CUT TO:

	INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

	OUR VIEW FROM A JERKY POV

	Running, freshly killed bodies at our feet. HEAVY BREATHING.

	Small fists beat against a door.

				GIRL'S VOICE
		Mom! Dad! It's loose! He's loose!

	The door swishes open revealing the dead bodies of a couple in their 
	forties.

	CLOSE ON THE GIRL

	We recognize her as the frozen girl. Her name, RIZZO (18), pretty.
	She screams. Turns.

	HER POV

	Standing at the end of the corridor, back lit and ominous is JASON 
	VOORHEES! He marches towards her.

	She runs. Snatches a headset from a wall mount.

				RIZZO
		Help me! Anyone! Somebody help me!

	STATIC from the radio. Jason closing.

	She reaches down and grabs a shot gun from a dead Security Guard. Chick-
	chick. KABLAM!

	Jason keeps coming.

	She runs.

	As she rounds a corner, we  see - -

	CRYOGENICS LAB

	She opens the door and enters the cold room. Slips on the wet frozen 
	ground, nearly falls.

	ON JASON as he rounds the corner, sees the open door.

	INT.   CRYO LAB

	Jason enters, his machete held ready. He stares at the Huge Cryo unit. 
	Door open. Otherwise the room is empty.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Hey!

	Jason turns. Rizzo is standing in the hall, the shotgun ready.

				RIZZO
		You son of a bitch!

	KABLAM! Jason slides backwards on the slick floor.

	KABLAM! Further, he nearly falls. 

	KABLAM! He stumbles, falls backwards into the cryo-unit.

	Rizzo slams her palm onto a console, the Cryo-unit door closes, JASON 
	INSIDE.

	RIZZO tosses the gun to the floor and types on a keypad.

	Steam HISSES, engines hum to life. The Cryo-Unit, Bucks violently.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Cryo-Unit activated.

	Slowly the unit goes silent, still. Rizzo stares at it, approaches 
	slowly, staring at the fogging glass -


	KA-CHING!

	The MACHETE BURSTS THROUGH THE GLASS, slicing into Rizzo's shoulder!

	ALARMS SOUND. The cryo lab's main door SLAMS shut.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Cryo-Unit leak. Lock down in progress.
		Security measures on line.

				RIZZO
		Nooooooo!

	She rushes toward the door. It won't budge.

				RIZZO
		Somebody! No!

	CHSHSHSHSHSH!

	Gas filters into the room from the leak in the Cryo-Unit.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Subject in computer unit has reached
		full incubation.

	Rizzo begins to fade. She stumbles.

				RIZZO
		No . . . 

	Cryo gas rolls along the floor . . .

	As blood pours from her wound, she reaches her bloody hand to the glass 
	window and draws -

	A SKULL AND CROSSBONES.

	-then passes out.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	RIZZO'S EYES pop open. She gasps for breath. Coughing and splitting the 
	Gel-like substance. She's sitting in a foot of gel, naked; Yllo, Brodski 
	and the kids around her.

				THORGAN
		That one did it!

	Yllo moves close to Rizzo.

				YLLO
		We should expect a moment of
		disorientation.

	WHAM! Rizzo punches Yllo in the nose.

				DELONGPRE
		Spunky . . .

				YLLO
		She broke my fucking nose!

				KAY-EM 14
		Again proving that your ancestors were savages.

				BRODSKI
		I like her already.

				KAY-EM 14
		Live signs full strength. Heart rate above normal - 

	Rizzo's disoriented, confused. Gel slops all around her.

				RIZZO
		Where..? Who . . .?
			(shock)
		I'm alive. You brought me back.

				YLLO
			(rubbing his nose)
		Obviously so.

	Rizzo looks down at her body, gel dripping off her naked flesh.

				RIZZO
		What the hell is this shit?

	Delongpre gives her a blanket. She covers herself.

				RIZZO
		How did I get here, how did you bring me back?

				YLLO
		Nanotechnology.

				RIZZO
		Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.

				YLLO
		We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.

				RIZZO
		30? How long was I out?

	Rizzo finally takes a good look at where she is. Something is very wrong 
	in her world.

				YLLO
		The year is 2455. You've been frozen
		for the past four hundred years.

	Rizzo gasps -- a shocking revelation.

				YLLO
		Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some 
		questions...

				RIZZO
		JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!

				THORGAN
		The hockey player? He a friend of yours?

				RIZZO
		Hockey player? He's not a ...

				THORGAN
		He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!

				RIZZO
		Old Earth?

				YLLO
		We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a
		few questions.

				RIZZO
		But...I...400 years?

				YLLO
		That's right, now if you could...

	Delongpre frowns at Yllo and moves to Rizzo.

				DELONGPRE
		It can wait. Let's get you cleaned up.

	Delongpre helps Rizzo off the table.

				YLLO
		Wait a minute...I need...

				BRODSKI
		Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.

				DELONGPRE
		Come on.

	INT.  LAB FOUR

	Rizzo stands at a small window looking out into space. Cleaned up she is 
	quite beautiful.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo?

	Rizzo is startled. She looks around.

				RIZZO
		Yeah?

	Delongpre comes through the door with a plate of food. 

				DELONGPRE
		I thought that after 400 hundred years,
		you just might have a little bit of an appetite.

	He puts the food on a small table and moves to the window.

				DELONGPRE
		You're on Grendel, a class IV Catamaran 
		transport.
		It's basically a school bus. We're on our way 
		back to Earth II.
		It's finals week.

	She turns back to the window.

				RIZZO
		You're telling me I'm a friggen class project?

	Delongpre flinches, expecting to be hit.

				DELONGPRE
			(a beat)
		Sort of. I mean, no, not really ...

	She collapses onto the bed.

				DELONGPRE
		I'll give you a moment alone. Do you
		want me to come get you when we start
		the dissection?

	Rizzo shrugs. She's lost everyone and everything. She's lot 400 years.

	Delongpre backs out of the room, closing the door behind him.

	Rizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes. She reaches into the pocket 
	of her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys. The key chain holds a 
	picture...a picture of her parents. She sits on the bed and starts to cry.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	As Delongpre enters all eyes turn to him.

				YLLO
		Well?

				DELONGPRE
		She needs a little time.

				YLLO
		More time...shit, she's had 400 years...

	Yllo laughs at his own joke.

				DELONGPRE
		That's really funny.

				YLLO
		I'd want her statements before we reach porch.
		Jesus, women.

				DELONGPRE
		Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything
		she went through?

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Dissection?

	Theyturn. Rizzo approaches Delongpre and Yllo.

				RIZZO
		Jason? He's on this ship?!

				YLLO
		Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in
		400 years...except for you, of course. Look if 
		you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking
		and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the
		publicity.

				RIZZO
			(glares)
		Are you finished?

	Yllo nods then --

	WHAM!

	Rizzo punches him again.

				YLLO
		God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!

				DELONGPRE
		Oh I like her a lot.

				BRODSKI
		I'm with you kid.

				RIZZO
		Where is he?

				BRODSKI
			(points)
		Lab two, relax. What's the matter?
		He's dead.

				RIZZO
		No, you're dead! You're all dead!

	She shoves Delongpre out of the way and out the door.

	INT.  LAB TWO - MOMENTS LATER

	The others enter to find Rizzo leaning over Adrienne's headless body.

				YLLO
		Jesus!

				JANESSA
		Oh my God! Adrienne?

				THORGAN
		What have you done?

				RIZZO
		What have I done?! Idiots.

	Thorgan throws up.

		BOEMAN
			(into a mike)
		Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an
		emergency!

				DELONGPRE
		Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?

				RIZZO
		I'll tell you where he is. He's walking
		around this ship, killing anything that
		moves.

				JANESSA
		Maybe she tripped.

	Brodski and Kicker burst into Lab Two, they react to the carnage.

				BRODSKI
		Jesus, God!

				KICKER
		Oh man, what the hell happened?

				RIZZO
		Jason! Can't you see? He did this.

				YLLO
		Impossible! He was dead before he entered
		Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could
		be alive.

				RIZZO
		I didn't say he was alive.

								CUT TO:

	INT.   GRID 52

	Azrael moves through a maze of walls and pipes. Stea, HISSES lights 
	STROBE. 

	He's dressed in full military garb, a huge gun strapped to his hsoulder.

	STALKING POV

	Something watching Azrael, his back to us. Azrael moves. The stalker
	closes in.

	Suddenly Azrael hits, rolls and comes up Blasting right at us.

	HIS POV

	A HUGE ALIEN CREATURE, fangs, claws and so on, leaps at him. THe big
	blaster hits home. The alien DISINTERGRATES.

	Sitting on the floor, Azrael sighs and wipes his brow.

	SUddenly, another alien rises up behind him with a hideos Screech. 
	There's nothing Azrael can do. He's a goner. Then --

	FZZT! A blast from elsewhere DISINTERGRATES THE CREATURE. MOVE TO 
	REVEAL--

	DALLAS, the grunt Azreael had words with earlier.

				DALLAS
		That's nine to four, geek-boy.

				AZRAEL
		You got lucky.

				DALLAS
		You got lucky. I could have waited until he
		ate your head.

				AZRAEL
		Speaking of which, duck!

	Dallas hits the deck as Azrael FIRES, disintegrating another. Beyond it 
	lunge a half dozen more.  Dallas and Azrael scramble to their feet,
	take aim, when --

	ONE OF THE ALIENS IS CUT IN HALF!

	GREEN GOO squirts from its body.

				AZRAEL
		What the?!

	JASON VOORHEES 

	SLASHES THROUGH another alien, splitting it down the middle.
	Then another.

				DALLAS
		He's good.

	Azrael smiles knowingly. He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason. 
	Aliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on. Dallas joins in
	unloading on the hulinking terror.

	THeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever.

				DALLAS
		That sucks. Why won't he go down?

				AZRAEL
		Pause play.

	Suddenly the aliens freeze in place. Jason stares at them, then turns to 
	Dallas and Azrael.

				DALLAS
		He's not part of the program.

				AZRAEL
		Hey cool. They brought ancient
		hockey guy back to life.

	Jason walks up to them. Titls his head like a dog hearing a high-pitched 
	whistle.

	Why aren't they running.

				AZRAEL
		Hey! We're playing a game here.
		Get off the court!

	Jason raises his silver blade high.

				DALLAS
		No, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts...

	SLASH! The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his 
	rib cage. Blood spurts
	as his right side pulls away from his body. Azrael does not seem hurt, 
	only pissed.

				AZRAEL
		Asshole that does not count as a kill.

				DALLAS
		Yes it does.

				AZRAEL
		Oh, come on!

	JASON is confused. He spins and slashed taking Dallas' head clean off. 
	The head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks.

				DALLAS
		Okay, enough of this shit.

				AZRAEL
		Alright, asshole.

	The sound of an ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN.

	Jason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court, all white, 
	sterile.

	No creatures, no Dallas or Azrael. A both ends of the white garganuan 
	room we see a small tinted glass.

	Azrael's voice booms over a loud speaker.

				AZRAEL(V.O.)
		Clear off the court, asshole.

	INT.  BOOTH ONE

	Azrael sits before a huge console wearing a virtual reality suit.

	INT.  BOOTH TWO

	Dallas is in his own suit from the opposite booth.

				DALLAS
		I don't have all day, kid.

				AZRAEL
		Yeah yeah I better call the labs,
		see what the hell is going on.

	Jason stares at the tinted glass of Azrael's booth.

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		Lab...this is AZ in the game grid.
		Your guy got out and runined our game.

	INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

	INT   LAB TWO

	The reaction to the broadcast.

				YLLO
		Azrael can you repeat that?

				RIZZO
		Get him out of there!

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		I said the guy in the mask is in here
		ruining our game.

	Jason starts to close in on Azrael's pod.

				AZRAEL
			(continuing)
		Send someone to the grid to pick
		him up. He looks lost.

				YLLO
		That's impossible.

				RIZZO
		I told you! Get them out of there!
			(grabs mike)
		Get out of there! Get out of there now!

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		All right fine, we'll head back--

	Suddenly, JASON shoves his fist through the glass.

				DALLAS
		Jesus!

	The sounds of Azrael's DEATH broadcast over the lab.

	When Jason retrieves his hand, he holds a bloody mass of Azrael's 
	insides.

	IN THE LAB, Brodski takes charge.

				BRODSKI
		Dallas! That you? Come back!

				DALLAS
			(into mike)
		Sarge! Get the fuck down here!
		We got a real shitstorm in the --

	DALLAS fights to get out of his virtual reality suit and get himself 
	into combat mode...BUT...

	JASON hears the movement. Turns, flings his silver blade.

	It flies across the room, throught the glass and impales Dallas' throat 
	to his chair.

	The blade shrots out the electronics in the grid and plunges the room to 
	black.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	As the connection goes to static.

				BRODSKI
			(into mike)
		Dallas?! Dallas?! Do you copy?

	Nothing. Finally...

				RIZZO
		He's dead. They're both dead. You
		don't understand what is on this ship.
		This is a being that kills. That's what
		he does. That's all he does. And he is very
		good at it.

				BRODSKI
		Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell
		me what the hell is going on!

	She gets up and heads for the door.

				DELONGPRE
		Where are you going?

				RIZZO
		We have to get off this ship.

	Yllo who has been losing control takes on the lead again.

				YLLO
		That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.

				RIZZO
		Why don't you get it? He's going to kill
		us all!

				BRODSKI
		I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever
		your ancient hockey player can throw at us.

				RIZZO
		Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship...
		and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the
		only way you're going to live.

				DELONGPRE
		You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future.
		We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of
		the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more
		advanced than what you're used to.

				RIZZO
		I hope so.

	EXT.  GAME GRID CORRIDOR

	Sven and Kicker approach the door. Casually, weapons slung low. The 
	doors hiss open, the black maw of the game grid on the other side.

				KICKER
		Damn. Are they playing?

				SVEN
		Dallas?! Azrael!

	Their combat sense perks up a bit. Something's not right. They turn on 
	their lights and ready their weapons.

	INT.  GAME GRID

	WIDE:  Hard beams of light search for anything.

	Sven, as his beam hits Azrael's pod.

				SVEN
		Oh shit.

	From inside pod as Sven and Kicker approach. THe blood splattered inside
	 the glass glows in the throws of their lights.

	Kicker breaks off to inspect the other POD Sven tries to hold down his 
	lunch.

				SVEN
		Sarge, this is bad. The kid's
		His guts are ripped out.

				BRODSKI
			(over radio)
		Dead?

				SVEN
		Oh yeah.

	Kicker reaches the other POD. the darkness looms behind him as he finds
	his friend.
				KICKER
			(into radio)
		Sarge, this is Kicker. Dallas got

		should we do?

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Everyone is in shock except Brodski...he's a pro.

		Report to weapons. We're going

	KICKER IN THE GRID

				KICKER
		Roger that.
			(to himself)
		Time to kick some ass!

	From behind him a shape materializes. A hand reaches out of the 
	darkness.

	KICKER JUMPS! Spins around with his weapon at the ready!

	IT'S SVEN!

				SVEN
		Sorry!

				KICKER
		Don't friggen do that!

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Brodski is in assault mode.

				BRODSKI
		Yllo, what's your head count?

				YLLO
		Looks like we're missing two.
		Stone and Kkinsa.

				JANESSA
		You know, Stoney's done everyone
		on this trip but me..what's up with that?

	Brodski scans the room - a tactical assessment.

				BRODSKI
		This place should be safe. Get them
		back here. I don't want to be hunting
		around and kill one of your kids by accident.
		As much as I've dreamed of doing that.

	Brodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin.

				BRODSKI
		I need to know what you know about this guy.

				RIZZO
		Don't go out there. You can't win.
		We need to get off this ship. That's
		all there is to it.

				BRODSKI
		Not an option. I'm going to hunt this
		son of a bitch down.

	Rizzo shakes her head. She can't get through to this guy.

				BRODSKI
		I've been a grunt for fifteen years.
		There's not a problem I can't fix with
		enough ammunition.

	Yllo is getting no response.

				YLLO
		Stoney! Stoney if you can hear me,
		get your ass down to the lab immediately!

		I'm going to see if I can find them.

	Yllo opens the door and Kkinsa is there! Half-naked, covered in blood. 
	Janessa SCREAMS and the others gasp.

	Kkinsa falls to the floor..whimpering, in shock. Boeman rushes over
	to her with a blanket.

				KKINSA
		Sstoney's dead!

	They all look to each other, searching for what to say or do...Rizzo 
	puts her head in her hands...not again.

	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Brodski double-checks his sidearm as Yllo follows him down the hall.

				YLLO
		ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab,
		couple of hours no more. Let them take a
		look at our friends.

				BRODSKI
		Not a chance.

				YLLO
		JUst don't go in there half cocked.
		You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and
		ask questions later.

				BRODSKI
		You got that right.

	They arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM.

				YLLO
		This thing could be worth a great deal....
		scientifically...not to mention what the fat cats
		on Earth II would pay for it! Look, I'll split it with
		you 50/50...

	The door opens. The E-X Grunts are all there. Weapons in a rack on one 
	wall. They are in various states of battle dresss. Yllo follows Brodski in. 
	Brodski turns and faces him, his men behind.

				BRODSKI
		You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch!
		If that...that thing is out there, it's
		dead! You got it!!!

				KICKER
		Fuckin A...

				BRODSKI
		Now get out of our way...get back to the
		lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats...
		we've got a job to do!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo enters pissed off. The others are standing around not sure what to 
	do.

				YLLO
		That bastard! Boemen turn on the
		tracking monitors.

	Rizzo walks over to Kay-em 14. Thorgon is working on her.

				RIZZO
		Robot huh?

				KAY-EM 14
		Kay-em 14.

				RIZZO
		Barbie from hell...

				KAY-EM 14
		Cybernetics science droid,
		fluent in over six...

				RIZZO
		Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS,
		now how about you help me get
		out of this coffin, Barbie...

				KAY-EM 14
		I'm afraid I cannot assist.

	Rizzo is very frustrated.

				RIZZO
		I'm surrounded by idiots.

				KAY-EM 14
		You need to get laid!

	Thorgon looks up from his work.

				THORGON
		Sorry, I'm working on it.

				DELONGPRE
		Are all twenty-first century girls like you?

				RIZZO
		He'll kill us all. You know that, don't you?

	AN ALARM SOUNDS.

				THORGON
			(re:monitor)
		There's been an unauthorized entrance to the
		Cargo Bay.

				BRODSKI
		Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to
		Lab two and cover out backs.

				YLLO
			(into the mic)
		At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?

				BRODSKI (v.o.)
		I'll try.

								CUT TO:
	INT. CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

	kicker, sven, CONDOR, BRIGGS, and GEKO are locked and loaded. Dressed in 
	full armor,
	packing massive high tech weaponry, they are a sight to see. Jason may 
	have met his
	match.

				BRODSKI
		Alright, the teach requests we take this guy
		out at the knees. I say shoot to kill.

	The boys fidget with excitment. Bout time they see some action.

				BRODSKI
		So after you've killed him, put one in his knee
		so we can say we tried.

	The men LAUGH and high five.

				BRODSKI
		Go to infrared, stay in radio contact.
			(into headset)
		Teach you there?

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo walks in and sits at a bank of monitors. Through one, we see the 
	team standing at the cargo doors.

				YLLO
		Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		You just keep an eye out.

				YLLO
		Yeah yeah. Got it.

	Yllo removes his head set and quickly turns to a separate console. He 
	has his own agenda.

	INT.  CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

				BRODSKI
		Let's move out.

	The doors HISS open.

	INT. CARGO BAY

	A massive room. Boxes stacked hihg, some to the ceilin,g creating a 
	maze.

				BRODSKI
		Two teams, Port, starboard.

	They split up.

	INT. LAB ONE

	The kids are standing at a schematic of the ship. Several small blips 
	are entering the cargo area.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Kicker, anything?

				KICKER(V.O.)
		Negative.

	Rizzo stands over Thorgan to see the monitor.

				THORGAN
		Each blip represents a trained killer.
		It's men like that fought off the pirates
		on Earth II, battled Jauntuns on the solar 
		moons...

	For the moment, Rizzo looks distantly hopeful.

				RIZZO
		So, you're saying thse guys have like,
		lasers and stuff? They could hack him
		to pieces?

				THORGAN
		Exactly.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	Briggs and Geko move side by side. Condor brings up the rear. Suddenly 
	he is jerked out
	of view. 

	CLOSE ON CONDOR'S FACE, jason's hand around his throat. SNAP. The eyes 
	go dead, the neck broken.

	INT. LAB ONE

	Rizzo sees something. Her hopes fade.

				RIZZO
		WHAT'S IT MEAN WHEN ONE OF YOUR BLIPS 
	DISAPPEARS?

	All eyes turn to the schematic as one of the blips FLICKERS and FADES.

				KAY-EM 14
		E-x Grunt Condor has flatlined.

				BOEMAN
			(into mic)
		Sergeant, this is Boemen...

	INT.  CARGO BAY - STARBOARD

	Sergeant Brodski stops.

				BOEMAN(v.o.)
		You've lost Condor.

				BRODSKI
		Briggs, Geko, talk to me!

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	Briggs and Geko stare at each other.

				BRIGGS
		He was...he was right here!

	BACK TO BRODSKI

				BRODSKI
		DAMNIT to hell! We're coming to you!

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	A BLIP flashes for a second on the screen.

				THORGAN
		You see that?

				BOEMAN
		Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed
		fuselage.

	INT. CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

				BRIGGS
		Got it.

	BRIGGS and GEKO split up, moving around a large metallic tank.

	BRIGGS INFARED POV

	Gun ready, he moves around the crated fuselage slowly.

				BRIGGS
		I don't see anything.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	The blip flashes again.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		He's right there! In front of you!

	INFARRED POV reveal GEKO moving toward him.

				BRIGGS
		That's GEKO. mAYBE you kids should
		stay out of this.

	Briggs removes his gogles only to find Jason standing before him, 
	holding Geko's body...impaled
	onto his silver blade.

	BRIGGS fires...screams.

	INT.  LAB ONE

				BRIGGS(V.O.)
		He doesn't show up on...

	PAINFUL GURGLES then two more blips disappear.

				THORGAN
			(turns)
		Jesus, is this what it was like on your...

	Rizzo is cowering on the floor, her hands over her ears. She's sweating, 
	convulsing.

				BOEMAN
		Sergeant, you've lost two more men!

	INT. CARGO BAy - PORTSIDE

	Brodski and his remaining men double-time-it to the slaughter. Briggs 
	and Geko lie dEAD
	AT THEIR FEET.

				KICKER
		Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?

				BRODSKI
		Teach! Where the hell are you?!
		Where's our visuals?!!

	INT. LAB TWO

	Yllo is talking on  aseparate mike. Unwaakre of the slaughteri n the 
	next room.

				YLLO
		Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the
		Solaras Space Lab.

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.

				YLLO
		We've got a situation here! Just do
		as  you're told!

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon
		as we've passed Tara's rings we'll
		make the course correction.

	BACK TO YLLO.

				YLLO
		Thank you.

	Yllo disconnects, and turns to the other console.

				YLLO
			(into mic)
		Ok Sarge, what's your status?

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three
		men and your worthless fuck! After I 
		kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!

				YLLO
		But I didn't see...

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	GUNFIRE ERUPTS!

				SVEN(V.O.)
		I got him! I got him!

	INT. LAB ONE

	CHEERS from everyone except Rizzo who knows better. She shakes her head.

				THORGAN
		Yes!

				RIZZO
		Listen up duck fuckers, you can't
		kill this thing.

				BOEMAN
		Duck fuckers?

				RIZZO
		He's either unconcious or playing dead,
		whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay,
		you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.

				DELONGPRE
		Outta here?

				RIZZO
		Isn't there an escape POD on this ship?
		Something?

				THORGON
		There's a shuttle.

				RIZZO
		Alright, been nice knowing you.
		Who's with me?

				KKINSA
		I'll go.

				BOEMEN
		Yllo said stay here.

				KKINSA
		Fuck Yllo!

				BOEMEN
		They got him! You're not leaving!

	INT. CARGO BAY - MIDSHIP

	Sven is kneeling over Jason's body. 

				SVEN
		Big sucker too.

	Suddenly, Jason reaches up, grabs the back of Sven's head and SLAMS it 
	into his mask.
	Sven's forehead shatters.

	ON BRODSKI

	As he races around a crate. Sven's body is within sight. His killer 
	nowhere to be seen.

				BRODSKI
		Kicker? Where are you?

	Elsewhere we hear GUNFIRE followed closely by a SCREAM!

	ELSEWHERE

	Kicker crawls across the floor, blood spews from his mouth.

	PULL BACK TO RVEAL

	He's been split in half at the wait...his entrails dragging behind him..
	SHUNK! A machete throught the back of the neck puts him out of his 
	misery.

	INT. LAB ONE

				RIZZO
		Do something!!!

				THORGON
		Don't look at me! I'm in high school!

	INT. CARGO BAY

	Brodski runs. He's spooked. Twisting and turning in every direction.

				BRODSKI
		Find Crutch! Set up an ion field
		around the cargo bay. We'll torch
		the sucker! Yllo...you're a dead man!

	Brodski races toward the Cargo exit.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	ON MONITOR

	We see Brodski racing towards us. We also see Jason, lying in wait, 
	hidden by one 
	of the crates.

				YLLO
		Sergeant!

				BRODSKI
			(stops)
		What?

	Yllo considers then.
				YLLO
		Nothing.

	On the monitor we see Brodski move forward. He never saw Jason coming.
	BRODSKI SCREAMS.  Yllo turns his head.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	The kids stand in shock, silently staring at one another, listening to 
	the
	static of the dead communications. Boeman reaches over and clicks off 
	the radio.
	Silence.  Rizzo leaps to her feet.

				RIZZO
		Lesson number one, kiddies. You wanna
		get home safely then we get off this boat.

	Kkinsa starts t cry.

				KKINSA
		I don't understand...what does he want?

				RIZZO
		He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone
		on this ship.

	Rizzo looks at everyone.

				RIZZO
		Any questions?

	A side door HISSES OPEN. Yllo enters.

				YLLO
		You're not going anywhere.

				RIZZO
		You wanna die?

				YLLO
			(ignores her)
		Are we locked down?

				BOEMAN
		That door's the only way in or out and it
		won't open without the code.

				YLLO
		Then we wait. We're docking with Space Lab
		in less than an hour.

				RIZZO
		What good will that do?

				YLLO
		They can deal with this sort of thing.

				RIZZO
		More soldiers?

				YLLO
		Scientists. Very intellegent men.

				RIZZO
		That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's
		ass at a spelling bee!

				JANESSA
		Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out
		and let us handle this?

				YLLO
		Try to calm down. Just think, you're going
		to be famous!

				RIZZO
			(to kids)
		Guys, please come with me!

				YLLO
		4You're not going anywhere.

	Rizzo starts for the door but Yllo grabs her arms, holds them behind 
	her.

				DELONGPRE
		Now hold on! We should hear her out!

				THORGAN
		She's obviously dealt with this guy before.

				YLLO
		Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!

				DELONGPRE
		No shit. I got no problem with that.

	Janessa readies a hypo.

				THORGAN
		Maybe if we knew a little bit more about
		what we're delaing with here...

	Janessa moves behind Rizzo with the sedative.  Suddenly Rizzo throws her 
	head back, Salmming it into Yllo's nose. He CRIES OUT in pain.

	Janessa lunges with the syringe but Rizzo snatches her wrist, grabbing 
	the hypo, burying it into Janessa's left breast.

				RIZZO
		tNighty-night.

	Janessa collapses.  Yllo rushes Rizzo again, but this time Boeman 
	stands, blocks his path.

				CRUTCH
		Leave her be.

				RIZZO
		Ok, who do I gotta fuck to get off this boat?

	Thorgan timidly raises his hand.

				RIZZO
		Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship.
		Come with me.

				THORGAN
		Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space?
		We'll die oout there.

	Rizzo rushes the door. There's a code box on the wall.

				RIZZO
		How do you open the damn door?

				YLLO
		You're crazy!

	Kkinsa punches in the code. The door HISSES open.

				DELONGPRE
		Rizzo, he's out there.

				RIZZO
		Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.
			(looks at Delongpre)
		Last chance.

	The others stare at her. She's crazy.

				RIZZO
		Fine. Bye.

	She and Kkinsa exit, the door SWISHES CLOSED behind them.

				YLLO
			(favoring his nose)
		Pack your shit. We'll disembark in an hour.
		The guys at Space Lab have the necessary
		equipment to contain this thing and then we
		can study it.

	But the kids aren't so sure.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Yllo enters, makes sure he wasn't followed then approaches a console.

				YLLO
		Computer on line.

	A series of beeps.

				JANESSA(O.S.)
		What are you doing?

				YLLO
			(jumps)
		Jesus! Can't you knock?
			(back to console)
		Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Power to Beowulf disengaged.

				YLLO
			(to Janessa)
		She's too valuable. She's not leaving this ship.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GRENDEL BRIDGE

	Fat Lou and Bernie prepare for course corrections.

				FAT LOU
		Disengage auto-pilot.

				BERNIE
		Disengaged.

				FAT LOU
		New COURSE, seven-eighty-one.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	She banks slowly to the right.

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				BERNIE
		On course. ETA 36 minutes, 34 seconds.

				FAT LOU
		Engage auto pilot.

	Suddenly, Bernie is ripped from his chair! Electricity SHOOTS through  
	the console
	as Bernie's DIALOG becomes jibberish.

				BERNIE
		En-en-en-en...Eta-Eta...

	Fat Lou stares up in shock just before JASON SLAMS Bernie's torso ontop 
	of her.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	FAT LOU'S upper body has disappeared. In other words, Bernie now has 
	legs.
	Little good they'll do him.

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD.

	Far in the distance we see a tiny space station -- SPACE LAB.
	A monitor reads ...

	SPACE LAB ETA 00:35:59 and counting.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Rizzon and Kkinsa enter.

				RIZZO
		Which way?

	Kkinsa points. They head in that direction. Then Rizzo suddenly stops.

				KKINSA
		What?

				RIZZO
		Ssh.

	Rizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates.

				RIZZO
		He's in here.

	Kkinsa opens her mouth to scream. Rizzo slaps her hand over Kkinsa's 
	mouth.

				RIZZO
		You scream I'll snap your neck.
		Got it?

	Kkinsa nods. Rizzo releases her.

				KKINSA
			(whispers)
		How do you know?

				RIZZO
			(dread)
		I just know.

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	The crew has packed their essentials and now wait to dock with Space 
	Lab. Yll is standing
	before the others holding Jason's machete.

				YLLO
		We must assume the machete was an
		intricate part of the game of hockey.

				DELONGPRE
		I'm thinking Rizzo was right.

				YLLO
		Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?

				DELONGPRE
		Maybe we should go with them. Like you said,
		your Space Lab connections can deal with this 
	thing.
		At least we'll be safe.

				YLLO
		They are not going anywhere. I cut power to
		the  shuttle.

	The kids and Crutch stare at him. Cold hearted.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Rizzo and Kkinsa approach. 

				RIZZO
		Open the doors.

	Kkinsa punches in a series of buttons. Nothing.

				KKINSA
		Something's wrong.

				RIZZO
		Keep trying!

	INT.  LAB ONE

				YLLO
		Everyone ready?

	Yllo grabs a mike from a console.

				YLLO
		Fat Lou, what's the ETA?

	STATIC.

				YLLO
		Lou, goddamjnit! Bernie, where's Lou?!

	STATIC.

	Boeman moves to one of the consoles, clicks a few buttons.

	ON MONITOR

	We see the view from the bridge security camera. Lots of blood and the 
	mangled combination of Lou and Bernie.

				THORGAN
		Yuck.

				DELONGPRE
		We're screwed.

				YLLO
		The ship doesn't need pilots to dock.
		We'll disembark and you'll see.
		Everything will be fine.

				BOEMAN
		Uh...that's gonna be a problem.
		The ship's not on auto-pilot.
		We're flying blind.
			(a beat)
		Thirty minutes till impact.

	All eyes turn to Yllo, for guidance, his back to the outer door.

				YLLO
		I guess...we'll have to go to the bridge.

				THORGAN
		But...

	Jason is out there. Then --

	WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

	The outer door bucks and dents! Everyone jumps!

	WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

								QUICK-CUT TO:

	INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Over the headsets, Rizzo and Kkinsa hear the SCREAMS.

				RIZZO
		Damnit, he's got them.

	Kkinsa keeps trying the code box. Nothing.

				KKINSA
		Rizzo, I think Yllo must have done
		something. The door won't open.

	INT.  LAB ONE

				YLLO
		It's alright. He can't get in here!

	WHAM! WHAM!!! But the door is starting to give.

	Through the confusion, Crutch moves to one of the consoles. Clicks
	away at the keyboard.

	INT.   SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle hums to life.

				KKINSA
		The power's back up!

				RIZZO
		Then open the doors!

				KKINSA
		Thirty seconds.

	INT.   LAB ONE

	WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!

				JANESSA
		What do we do?!!

				YLLO
		Crutch?

				CRUTCH
		Help me up.

	Boeman helps Crutch to the top of a table. Crutch goes to work on a  
	ceiling
	vent, removing screws.

				JANESSA
		Okay, I'm guessing you should hurry.

	The top corner of the door bends...Jason peers through.

				THORGAN
		Jesus, tell this asshole I don't
		play hockey!

				CRUTCH
		Okay!

	Our group starts climbing the table and into the ceiling space.

				YLLO
		Will that take us to the bridge?

				CRUTCH
		It's a maze up there, but yes.

				YLLO
		We'll engage auto-pilot!
		Everything'll be fine!

	With that, the door gives!

	Boeman heaves Crutch into the crawl space then follows himself.  Jason 
	pauses,
	staring at Kay-Em --

				KAY-EM 14
		Heart beat irregular...no blood flow...
		impossible...this....this... does not
		make sense.

	Jason's heard enough. He swings his cleaver, but Kay-Em ducks. Turns and 
	leaps
	through the hole in the celing.

	INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

	Yllo grips the ledge.

				YLLO
		Move it people!

	Then Yllo screams. Jason has him from below. Boeman grabs his arms.

				BOEMAN
		Help me!

	DeLongpre grabs hold and pulls. Suddenly Yllo is jerked out of their
	grasp. They fall onto their backs breathing heavily.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo leaps to his feet. Jason looms over him.

				YLLO
		Now hold on! Have you considered
		how valuable you are? Credit, fame,
		you can have it all. And ladies. I 
		mean, how long has it been?

	Jason stands there, but his attention isn't on Yllo. It's on the machete 
	sticking through
	Yllo's belt. Jason reaches for it. Yllo backs into a wall.

	Jason slowly removes the machete from Yllo's belt and stares at it. He 
	drops
	the cleaver to the ground.

				YLLO
			(chuckles)
		That's all you wanted?

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle doors slide open as we hear over the headset --

				YLLO(V.O.)
		It's okay, he just wanted his machete.

				RIZZO
			(knowingly)
		Three...two...one...

	Yllo screams.

	INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

	Yllo's SCREAMS turn to GURGLES. All eyes stare at the opening in the 
	walkway, then --

	YLLO'S HEAD LANDS IN BOEMAN'S LAP!

				KAY-EM 14
		Now that's just gross.

	JASON STICKS HIS HEAD THROUGH.  EVERYONE JUMPS, SCREAMS.

				DELONGPRE
		GO, GO, GO!

	They race down the walkway, over huge pipes and through electrical 
	wires, Crutch 
	in the lead.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Kkinsa enters the shuttle, turns to Rizzo.

				KKINSA
		Rizzo, come on!

	But, Rizzo hesitates. We can still hear the PANICKED SCREAMS over the 
	headset.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Go-go-go-go-go!!!!

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		He's right behind us!

				RIZZO
		Damn!
			(to Kkinsa)
		Close the door! I'll be right back.

				KKINSA
			(panicked)
		What?!!

				RIZZO
		I gotta go back.

				KKINSA
		But?!!

	Rizzo turns and races through the maze of boxes and crates leaving 
	Kkinsa nearly
	insane.

	INT.  CELING WALK SPACE

				KAY-EM 14
		I'm quite sure I wasn't designed for this.

	Crutch comes to a fork in the walkway.

				CRUTCH
		Okay, we need to ...

				BOEMAN
		You forgot didn't you, you old
		fart?

	At the back of the line, Delongpre turns as Jason rounds the bend behind 
	him.

				DELONGPRE
		Shit! Move it! He's coming!

	Delongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan

				DELONGPRE
		Go!

	Racing forward the group stays just out of Jason's grasp. Leaping
	over and under and through whatever blocks the path.

				DELONGPRE
		Faster!

	Jason swings his machete at DeLongpre! It just misses him.

				DELONGPRE
		FASTER!!!

	Crutch comes to ascreened panel. Boeman kicks it open.
	They leap down onto a catwalk crossing the --

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	They are twenty feet off the ground as --

	Rizzo stops, stares straight up.

	HER POV

	the group races across the catwalk as Json leaps down behind them.

				DELONGPRE
		He's right on my ass!

	Then Jason grabs Delongpre, who screams.

	RIZZO,

	spots a gun left by one of the marines. She snatches it, points it 
	towards
	Jason and Delongpre then aims a little high.

	FZZZT!

	It slices through a metal cord holding the catwalk to the ceiling.

	The catwalk jerks. Everyone tumbles. Jason loses his grip on Delongpre.

	Suddenly, METAL SCREECHES, as the catwalk gives under the weight. It 
	RIPS in half,dumping both
	heroes and Jason.

	RIZZO dives out of the way as a pile of metal and bodies crash to the 
	ground!

	Janessa sits up rubbing her head.

				JANESSA
		That was fun.

	Kay-Em 14 sits up, sings.

				KAY-EM 14
		I got a brand new pair of
		roller-skates, you got a brand new key...

				JANESSA
		Thorgan?!

				THORGAN
		I didn't do it. The fall scattered her
		programming..wait. Where's? Shit!

	He's lying on top of Jason. He scrambles to his feet. But Jason doesn't 
	move.

				THORGAN
		Hey, I think the fall killed him.

	The group slowly gathers around. Jason sits up and swings at Thorgan. 
	Boeman pulls him out of
	the way just in time.

	Jason starts to stand when RIZZO comes up behind him.

	KA-FWAM! She brings the barrel of a high tech gun down on the top of 
	Jason's head.
	He collapses. The surrounded faces look happily suprised.

				RIZZO
		Trust me, it's temporary.

	Boeman takes the gun from Rizzo.

				BOEMAN
		Better let me.

				THORGAN
		Where'd you get the gun?

	Rizzo gestures at what's left of Geko's body.

				CRUTCH
		The bridge is this way!

	They take off running.

				RIZZO
		Wait!

	Everyone stops, turns --

				KAY-EM 14
		There's not enough time.

	Rizzo catches up.

				RIZZO
		Forget the bridge, the shuttle's
		waiting!

				BOEMAN
			(to Kay-Em)
		What do you mean, not enough time?

				KAY-EM 14
			(switches voice)
		You know what you get if you shove
		two bananas up your ass? Two shit covered
		bananas.

				JANESSA
		I think your metal lover's losing it.

				KAY-EM 14
			(normal voice)
		Impact in ten minutes. It will take 
		fifteen to reach the bridge.
			(switches voices, sings)
		Mamma's little baby love shortnin,
		shortnin, mamma's little baby love 
		shotnin bread...

				DELONGPRE
		Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.

				RIZZO
		Guys!!! The shuttle?

	The kids look at one another as if this were a stroke of genius.

				RIZZO
		Idiots.

				CRUTCH
		This way!

	Crutch again leads them through the maze. Delongpre stops at
	another Grunt body, removes a chain gun. THorgan takes a high
	tech laser from another.

				THORGAN
		I feel better. Now how do you
		fire this damn thing?

				DELONGPRE
		Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!

				CRUTCH
			(jokingly)
		Just around this bend...

	Jason steps out in front of Crutch, his machete held poised in front of 
	him.
	Crutch runs right up onto the blade.

				BOEMAN
		Nooooo!

	Alrhoguh he's meat on a stick, Crutch doesn't give up. He SLAMS his 
	fists into
	Jason's torso.

	Thorgan turns to fire --Boeman KNOCKS the barrel high.

				BOEMAN
		You'll hit crutch!

	Boeman tosses his weapon to Janessa and leaps on Jason's back, locking 
	his arms 
	around his neck.

				RIZZO
		What are you doing? You can't save him!

	Delongpre smashes the back of Jason's knee with the chaingun.
	Jason topples on top of Boeman. Crutch is thrown free.

	Janessa and Thorgan help Crutch to his feet as Jason sees Rizzo for the
	first time in 400 hundred years.

	It's either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge. He leaps to his
	feet and races towards her.

				RIZZO
		Don't just stand there! Shoot him!

				DELONGPRE
			(to Jason)
		No you don't!

	BRAAAAAAATTTT!

	The chaingun dances Jason backwards. He CRASHES through the side of one 
	of the 
	cargo boxes. EVERYONE STOPS.

				RIZZO
		Don't stop!

	She jerks the gun from Delongpre and races to the crate.

				RIZZO
		You never stop when he's down!

	But the crate is empty.

				RIZZO
		Shit!!!!

	They spin around, searching.

				CRUTCH
			(weak)
		Forget him. Come on.

	Carrying Crutch, they move toward the shuttle bay.

	INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	panel, clicks some buttons, then --

				BOEMAN
		Uh-oh.

				JANESSA
		What?!

				BOEMAN
		Kkinsa! Open the doors!

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT


	Kkinsa sits in the pilot's seat. She's terrified.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Kkinsa! He's coming! Open the doors!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	DeLongpre shoves Boeman out of the way.

				DELONGPRE
		Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!

				RIZZO
		Yeah, that's it, scare the hell
		out of here, that'll work.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(calming)
		Kkinsa, it's me, Rizzo. He's not
		out here right now, so please let us in.

	Kkinsa doesn't move.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to
		the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

				DELONGPRE
		Med-kit?

				RIZZO
		I guessed.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kkinsa considers. She reaches for a button marked SHUTTLE 
	DOORS...hesitates.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		We're going to be okay, Kkinsa.
		Just relax.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Kay-Em 14 steps forward.

				KAY-EM 14
		Allow me. I'm trained in all aspects
		of the human psyche.

	Rizzo backs away -- as Kay-Em nears the mike ...

				KAY-EM 14
		Kkinsa, dear, it is I, KAY-EM 14...
		open the fucking door you silly bitch!

	Rizzo shoves Kay-Em out of the way.

				KAY-EM 14
		I didn't say I was good at it.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Oh shit! There he is!

	INT.  CARGO BAY SHUTTLE

	Jason is standing at the entrance to the Cargo Shuttle Bay.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kkinsa leans forward and presses --

	LAUNCH.

	INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	The Shuttle ROARS to life and begins pulling away from the ship.

				BOEMAN
		Kkinsa! No!!!

	EXT.   GRENDEL CLASS IV

	The shuttle moves slowly away from the docking position.

	INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	Rizzo opens fire! Thorgan and Delongpre join in.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As boxes and cargo shatter under the heaby fire. Smoke rises. It's 
	impossible
	to see where Jason is. RIZZO stops FIRING.

				RIZZO
		DON'T WASTE YOUR AMMO!

	But, they don't let up. Boxes explode, crates collapse until -- 
	Thorgan's gun clicks empty.
	Then Delongpre's.

	SILENCE.

	The smoke slowly clears revealing the rubble.

				THORGAN
		Did we get him?

	Suddenly, Jason again steps into the Cargo entrance.

				DELONGPRE
		We're screwed!

				RIZZO
		400 years in the future and these
		pea-shooters are the best you can do?!

	They are trapped. Jason blocks the only exit. He slowly moves towards 
	them.

				RIZZO
		Just make a break for the door.
		He'll get some of us, but that's the
		breaks.

				BOEMAN
		We're not leaving Crutch!

				RIZZO
		We don't have time to argue!

	But Jason has locked in on Rizzo. He moves towards her.

				JANESSA
		Okay, tell you what. You die, we'll run.

	Rizzo and the others back into a corner. Jason has them. There's nothing 
	they
	can do.

	Rizzo holds the gun steady, waiting for point blank range. 

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	SPACE LAB, which was only a dot the last time we saw it, suddenly looms 
	toward us.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Collision eminent.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	The left side of Grendel SMASHES into the side of Space Lab!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	Suddenly everything shifts toward the bridge. Boxes, cargo, kids, and 
	Jason!

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	Grendel SLIDES along SPACE LAB, ripping huge chunks of metal from both.
	SPARK fly. There are interior EXPLOSIONS on Space Lab, then --

	KA-FOOM!

	Space Lab EXPLODES!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	The entire ship shifts upwards. Cargo, crew, and Jason fly into the air.

	ELECTRICAL fires sprout up all over. Cargo boxes SHATTER, contents 
	SPILLING.

	RIZZO loses her gun.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	Debris from Space Lab TEARS into the side of the ship and beyond.

	EXT.  SHUTTLE

	One huge chunk heads right towards the Shuttle.

	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Kkinsa stares out the window as the huge chunk flies toward her.

	EXT.  SHUTTLE 

	IMPACT! THE SHUTTLE IMPLODES! ONE BRIGHT RED FIREBALL.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Everything piled and in tatters. Our heroes slowly regain their 
	bearings.

				BOEMAN
		Everyone okay?

				THORGAN
		I think I broke my arm.

				KAY-EM 14
		I seem to have misplaced mine.

	Kay-Em 14's right arm is missing, wires sticking out of the stump.

				JANESSA
		You geeks wanna gimmie a hand?

	Janessa is buried beneath a pile of rubble. Boeman helps her to her 
	feet.

				DELONGPRE
			(quiet)
		We lost crutch.

	Rizzo stands and watches as the other sgather around Crutch's body.
	It's battered and twisted all out of place. Boeman falls next to the 
	body.

				BOEMAN
		Goodbye old friend.

				RIZZO
		Okay, he was a great guy, now
		let's move out.

				BOEMAN
			(snaps)
		Could you show a little compassion?!

	Rizzo stares at Boeman.

				RIZZO
		Look, I'm sorry. I really am, but aren't you
		forgetting about ...

	SUDDENLY a pile of rubble EXPLODES.

	Jason rises, his back to them.

				DELONGPRE
		Back to the labs!

	But Jason has other plans. Seemingly unfazed by the past events he 
	rushes after them.

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Dam-damage port side 59 percent.
		Decompression 40 percent. Gravity-y rotors
		failing.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Our kids race toward the door, Jason right behind them --

	Thorgan slams the door panel with his good arm. SPARKS fly.
	The door won't open.

				THORGAN
		Oh shit.

	They turn as Jason looms toward them, then --

	EVERYTHING STARTS TO FLOAT

	Cargo and debris. Our heroes. Jason.

	The loss of gravity and Jason's steamrollering momentum SLAMS him into 
	the 
	cargo doors, BREAKING them open and sending him tumbling backwards.

				JANESSA
		This is just great.

				KAY-EM 14
		Engage magnetics.

	Kay-Em 14's left hand magnetically locks to the Cargo frame a

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason grabs Rizzo's ankle. Boeman, floating close, punches Jason in the 
	back of the head.

	Still holding Rizzo's ankle, Jason topples, spinning the two out of 
	frame.

	The force of the punch sends Boeman in the opposite direction.

				THORGAN
		This is crazy, we can't do anything like this!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo KICKS Jason in the top of the head, sending him SLAMMING into the 
	ceiling.

	A SEVERED ARM

	floats past DeLongpre. There's a chain gun still clutched by the  hand.
	Delongpre grabs both and turns the gun on Jason.

	BRAAATTTT...

	Jason is sent further back, but the force of the chaingun SLAMS 
	Delongpre into a back wall.
	He's knocked unconcious.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Thorgan manages to grab Kay-Em 14 around the neck.

				THORGAN
		Grab my hand!

	Janessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious 
	dELONGPRE'S FOOT.

				JANESSA
		Boeman, can you reach DeLongpre?
		We'll push you in.

	CARGO - MIDSHIP

	Jason is floating toward the other end of the Cargo Bay,
	unable to stop himself.

	BOEMAN

	reaches for DeLongpre. Inches away. Finally he grabs Delongpre by the 
	locks of his
	hair, pulls himself closer.

				DELONGPRE
		Hey! That hurts.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling. She manages to grab hold of a 
	hanging piece of
	busted catwalk.

				DELONGPRE
			(to Rizzo)
		Push off toward us.

				JANESSA
		Forget her, she's a pain in the ass.
		Let her hang there.

	Crutch's body floats into our heroes, his intestines spilling from his 
	open gut,
	tangling around our heroes.

				THORGAN
		I'm gonna spew.

				JANESSA
		That ought'a help the situation.

				DELONGPRE
		Do it Rizzo! We'll catch you.

	RIZZO'S POV

	Rizzo stares at the human rope that consists of Thorgan, Janessa, 
	Boeman, and Delongpre.

				RIZZO
		What if you miss?

				DELONGPRE
		What if we don't?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	AS JASON steadies himself against a wall, focuses in one Rizzo, then 
	pushes off with his feet.

	HE ROCKETS toward her!

				DELONGPRE
		He's coming right at you!

	Rizzo spots Jason and pushes off! But her aim was HURRIED...
	and bad. She's gonna miss them.

	Boeman flips in the air!

				BOEMAN
			(to Delongpre)
		Grab my feet!

	Delongpre does and Boeman reaches out and snags Rizzo. The momentum 
	spins the human
	chain into a near wall --KAFWAM-- nearly breaking it apart.

				JANESSA
		Okay that hurt.

				BOEMAN
		Thorgan, pull us in.

	Jason SLAMS into the ceiling, then careens off of the wall --

	As Thorgan pulls the group out of the Cargo bay.

				THORGAN
		What now?

	They watch as Jason grabs a hold of the walkway.

				JANESSA
		Shit. He's gonna send himself right at us.

	Jason takes aim.

								QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				COMPUTER VOICE
		System repair activated. Back up power on line.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Jason again ROCKETS THROUGH THE AIR -- when

	GRAVITY IS RESTORED.

	He drops to the cargo floor like a rock! Falling cargo -- huge crates, 
	gargantuan machines,
	a forklift -- buries him.

	Our heroes tumble to the ground.

				JANESSA
			(to Rizzo)
		Get off of me!

	They stand slowly, eyeing the rubble.

				THORGAN
			(rubbing his arm)
		You think it killed . . .
			(off Rizzo's stare)
		Yeah, I guess not.

				JANESSA
		Let's just get out of here.

				BOEMAN
		The ship's in bad shape. Back to
		the labs. Let's check out status.

	INT. SHIP CORRIDORS

	Our group makes their way back toward the labs.

	ELECTRICAL fires are everywhere. Systems are shorting out all over the 
	ship.

	INT. LAB ONE

	Rizzo, in the lead, enters the lab, when the ship BUCKS and QUAKES! A 
	portion of the hall
	collapses behind her.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Boeman and the others dive back out of the way.

				BOEMAN
		Shit!

				THORGAN
		The hull's imploding!

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo! Can you hear me?!

	INT.  LAB ONE

				RIZZO
		Yeah. Are you guys okay?

	Boeman peers through a crack in the collapsed hull.

				BOEMAN
		There's a red lever on the wall
		beside you. Pull it!

	Rizzo turns, spots the red lever. EMERGENCY PRESSURIZATION STABILIZER.
	It's bolted.

				RIZZO
		It's locked!

				BOEMAN
		Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's
		going to depressurize!

	Rizzo kicsk the metal leg from a table. BASHES the bolt with it, until 
	it breaks.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry Rizzo! You have to reverse
		the pressurization.

	She grabs the lever...then hesitates. Backs away.

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing?!!

				RIZZO
		If the ship goes, so does Jaso.

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo pull the fucking lever!

				RIZZO
		No.

				DELONGPRE
		Rizzo?!

				RIZZO
		It's better this way. If we were rescued
		Jason would just get off the ship. You want
		him on your precious Earth II?

	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Boeman and the other start tearing the debris out of the way!

				THORGAN
		Hurry! She's lost it!

				JANESSA
		So what else is new?

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Boeman climbs through a hole in the rubble. He grabs the lever.

				RIZZO
		Boeman don't. You know I'm right.

				JANESSA
		Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!

	Boeman yanks the lever.

	As the others climb into the lab --

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Depressurization inconclusive.

				KAY-EM 14
		We've lost too much pressure. An hour, tops.

				JANESSA
			(to Rizzo)
		You happy? You've killed us all!

	Thorgan rushes over to the big Nano-tech machine. Places his broken arm 
	on the slab.
	The machine quickly goes to work.

	A schematic of his arm appears on the wall.

	Janessa stares at him.

				JANESSA
		What's the point?

	Delongpre shrugs.

				DELONGPRE
		So that's it then.

	It seems it is.

	Janessa stands over Yllo's decapitated body. It's obvious their 
	relationship
	went beyond just teacher/student. There is a loud METALLIC WHINE from 
	the ship's
	hull.

				RIZZO
		What's that?

				BOEMAN
		THat's the sound of deep space attacking the
		integrity of the ship.

				KAY-EM 14
		No...
			(signing)
		That's the sound of the men working
		on the chain gang.

				RIZZO
		Are there any other shuttles?

				JANESSA
		No.

				RIZZO
		Teleportation? Some way to beam us the
		hell out of dodge?

				THORGAN
		You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?

				JANESSA
		A little late to be thinking about
		escape, isn't it?

				KAY-EM 14
		I'll never experience my fantasy of
		three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod.
		Damn.

				THORGAN
		Am I in there?

				KAY-EM 14
		Sory...

				RIZZO
		Hey.

				DELONGPRE
		That's a good fantasy, though.
		Kinky, but good.

				RIZZO
		Hey!!

	All heads turn to Rizzo. She's staring at a schematic of the ship. The 
	left hull
	of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the 
	various 
	system failures. Rizzo points to the right hull.

				RIZZO
		What's this?

				DELONGPRE
		It's the engine, reactors, audiometers,
		it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.

	Rizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls.

				RIZZO
		Can we get through these?

				THORGAN
		Sure but what good will that do?

				BOEMAN
		When the left hull goes, so will the
		right.

				RIZZO
		What if we blow the walkways first?
		Leave Jason over here to go up with
		the ship?

	They stare at her.

				JANESSA
		You know, Yllo seemed to think we could
		catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth
		millions.

	The others stare at her as if she were crazy.

				RIZZO
		Any connection between your reality and mine
		is purely coincidental.

				JANESSA
		I'm just saying.

				RIZZO
			(to others)
		Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit.
		Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up
		the doors and blow the walkways?

				DELONGPRE
		We'd need charges.

				BOEMAN
		We could convert fission transistors.

				THORGAN
		We're not supposed to do that.

				BOEMAN
		What are you gonna do, tell me?

		DELONGPRE
		The engine room will have molecular welders.
		We could seal up the hull.

	A moment of consideration. Could this actually work?

				JANESSA
		YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big
		guy distracted with a blow job.

				THORGAN
		Would you?

				KAY-EM 14
		Now this is getting exciting.

				DELONGPRE
		Remember to roll his balls around a bit.

				RIZZO
		You got a better plan?

	Obviously they don't. They got to work. Boeman grabs a number of devices 
	from under
	a cabinet.

				BOEMAN
		I'll need system four converters.

				THORGAN
		They're back here.

				DELONGPRE
		How many?

				BOEMAN
		Bring 'em all. Let's move!

	Thorgan's still hooked up to the Nano-Tech machine.

				THORGAN
		Hey! I'm not ready.

				BOEMAN
		Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley
		one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there.
		Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.

				JANESSA
		You're so bossy.

				THORGAN
		You're leaving me here alone?

	Delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him.

				DELONGPRE
		Don't blow your foot off.

	They climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear.

				KAY-EM 14
		It's just you and me, then.

				THORGAN
		Come here, might as well fix that arm.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Boeman, Janessa, Delongpre, and Rizzo slowly move through the piles of 
	debris.
	Still burning cargo creates a ghastly image of flickering shadows.

				DELONGPRE
		See anything?

	They move toward the rubble that had buried Jason before.

	CLOSE on the rubble.

	There is an obvious hole dug out from the middle.

				DELONGPRE
		I think I speak on behalf of the group
		when I say this is bad news.

				BOEMAN
			(into headset)
		Thorgan? You coming?!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Thorgan is fooling around in the back of Kay-Em 14's head. The nano-tech 
	maching is 
	doing a full diagnostics.

				THORGAN
			(into headset)
		Almost done.

				KAY-EM 14
		Ow!

				THORGAN
		Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.

				KAY-EM 14
		Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.

	INT. WALKWAY ONE

	Boeman enters, throws his pack to the ground and goes to work ttaching a 
	device to
	the wall of the huge glass connector.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Janessa enters and goes through the same motions.

	INT. WALKWAY THREE

	Delongpre and Rizzo attach a device to the wall.

				DELONGPRE
		Put your finger here.

	SHe does so. Delongpre connects several wires. Rizzo looks nervous. 
	Delongpre notices.

				DELONGPRE
		My father wanted me to be a businessman.

	Silence.

				DELONGPRE
		That's why I'm here.

				RIZZO
		So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against
		your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.

	Delongpre looks at her like she's crazy.

				DELONGPRE
		My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology 
		is part of the business. We happen to get along just 
	fine,
		smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's 
	balls
		for a change.

				RIZZO
		I thought you meant...

				DELONGPRE
		You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh?
		You must have been a very lonely girl.

	Silence. Neither speaks.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Thorgan rips a metallic sink from the wall. It CRASHES to the floor.

				THORGAN
		Sorry, sorry.

				KAY-EM 14(O.S.)
		Who are you apologizing to?

				THORGAN
		Good point.

	INT.  WALKWAY ONE

	Boeman attaches another charge. He's sweating. Nervous. Keeps looking
	over his shoulder. Standing alone on this long walkway is a creepy 
	sight.

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Janessa stops working, listens.

	KA-THUMP -- There's anoise in the Cargo Bay.

	She covers the mike on her headset and calls out.

				JANESSA
		Thorgan, you little shit, is that you?

	No answer. She quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of 
	tranquillizer
	and a monster syring.e She fills this rhino syringe with a massive 
	dosage. Enough to
	bring down a Rhino...or Jason maybe?

	She starts moving down the walkway toward the Cargo Bay.
	Surely she's not that stupid.

	INT.  WALKWAY THREE

	Rizzo is staring at Delongpre as he works on another device.
	Then --

				RIZZO
		When I was four, the ocean quit producing
		life. Too many pollutants. Nuclear testing,
		the occasional terrorist bombing...the
		atmosphere was shit by the time I was eight.
		We moved underground when I was twelve.

	Delongpre stares at her. He doesn't want to speak and screw up this
	rare moment of sharing.

	INT.   CARGO BAY

	Janessa enters. Looks around.

	The cargo bay is dark and looming. Lights flicker. Emergency lights
	strobe. It's hard to make anything out.

	We hear Rizzo speaking Off Screen.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		My father was an army Scientist.
		Genetics. The army thought they could
		develop humans able to survive the Earth
		we had created

	Janessa moves through the debris.

	ANOTHER POV

	We see Janessa come into view.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Jason seemed to have the right stuff.
		Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell
		damage, didn't matter. He just kept
		going.

	INT.  WALKWAY THREE

				DELONGPRE
		Were you close to your father?

	Thorgan interrupts over the headset.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Delongpre? What did you do with the
		chain gun?

	Delongpre frowns.

				DELONGPRE
			(into mike)
		It's on the table where I left it!
		What the hell are you doing?!
		Hurry up!

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I'm on my way.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thorgan, quit screwing around and
		come on!

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I'm coming, I'm coming.

				DELONGPRE
		Sorry, you were saying?

	INT. CARGO BAY

	WATCHER'S POV

	JANESSA approaches the pile of debris where Jason was buried.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		I got along great with my father,
		my mother too. Dad and the others thought
		they could learn a great deal from this 
		thing the army had been keeping on ice for
		over a hundred years.

	Janessa moves the debris around with her foot.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		They were all wrong. They couldn't control
		him.

	INT. WALKWAY THREE

				DELONGPRE
		And what happend to ...?

	Rizzo begins to tear up.

				RIZZO
		I couldn't save them.

				DELONGPRE
		Well, we'd be dead without you.
		You know that, don't you?

	She stares at him.

				DELONGPRE
		It's true.
			(chuckles)
		You caused enough stink that we
		were at least a little cautious.
		Of course this is the first field
		trip I went on that had a body count.

	She gives him a  half smile.

				DELONGPRE
		I'm not much, but I promise, I won't
		let this guy get you.

	Another half smile. It's a sweet gesture, but what can this guy really 
	do?

	INT. CARGO BAY

	JASON'S POV

	He watches Janessa from a  distance. Moving slowly and silently toward 
	her.

	She stands and turns as --

	SERGEANT BRODSKI grabs her!

	She SCREAMS.

	He's covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut.

				BRODSKI
		Where is everybody? What happened?

				JANESSA
		Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!

				BRODSKI
		Give me a break! What happened?

				JANESSA
		Jason. He's what happened. Then 
		Grendel hit Space Lab.

				BRODSKI
		Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands
		on Yllo.

				JANESSA
		Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.

				BRODSKI
		Takes more than a steelbalde to take
		this old dog down.

	KA-THUNK! 

	JASON"S MACHETE THRUSTS though Brodski's gut. Jason spins Brodski around 
	and tosses him to the floor!

				BRODSKI
		Yup, that ought'a do it.

	Jason turns on Janessa.

	She stands frozen in fear.

	Jason raises his machete and --

	JANESSA

	Lights a flare, blinding Jason for the moment. Then she sinks the Rhino 
	syringe 
	into his chest! Jason stumbles...falls hard on his ass and sits there 
	staring
	at her.

				JANESSA
		Well go on! Pass out!

	Jason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside.

				JANESSA
		Shit.

	Jason starts to climb to his feet. Janessa turns to run.

				BRODSKI
			(weak)
		He-help me...

	He holds his hand out to her. Then--

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		I'm blowing Walkway One. Hold on.

	KA-FOOM! The SHIP BUCKS!

	Janessa runs, leaving the sergeant behind.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - OUTSIDE WALKWAY THREE

	Delongpre closes the door, then --

				DELONGPRE
		We're blowing three. Hang on.

	He throws a switch!

	INT. CARGO BAY - BRIDGE SIDE

	Boeman vaults over a pile of rubble.

				BOEMAN
		Janessa, we're on our way to you!

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Holding hands, Delongpre and Rizzo enter. They stop...stand...stare.

	The walkway is empty. Janessa is gone.

	Boeman rushes up behind them.

				BOEMAN
		Where is...?

				DELONGPRE
		You tell me! She's only set one
		charge. And it's not finished!

	With that Janessa tears into the walkway. She's out of breath. She can 
	barely speak.

				BOEMAN
		Where have you been?!!

				JANESSA
		He....He...

				DELONGPRE
		He's coming!!!

	THEIR POV

	JASON moves through the debris. He's coming straight for them.

				BOEMAN
		Run!!

	They race down the length of the walkway. Jason right behind them.

				RIZZO
		We can't lead him into the other hull!

				BOEMAN
		We don't have a choice!

	Boeman slams the door panel. The door slowly rises.

	Jason approaches, stops, stares at his future victims. If he could smile
	with anticipation...he would. He raises his Machete --

	Then stops. Lowers it.

	CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG.

	He turns his back on our heroes. They crane their necks to see what has 
	pulled
	his attention.

	THORGAN marches down the walkway with KAY-EM 14. The new and imporved 
	KAY-EM 14.

	Where her severed arm had once been, a chain gun is now attached. A 
	laser cannon is
	mounted over her shoulder. Her body has been reinforced with steel from 
	around the lab.
	Sinks, trays, you name it. She's the junk yard man's terminator. Then --

				KAY-EM 14
		Do I have to?

				THORGAN
		Yes, I've reprogrammed you.
		You are very brave. Bad ass.

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh, alright.

	KAY-EM 14 INTERNAL SCAN POV

	We see a somewhat computerized image of Jason through Kay-Em's personal 
	scan.
	One the display we see:

	SUBJECT: DEAD
	CHANCES OF FUNCTION: 100 PERCENT
	DOES NOT COMPUTE . . . DESTROY SUBJECT

				KAY-EM 14
		Come on, boy. Let's see if we can
		open up  can'a whoop ass!

	BRAAAATTTT! The chain gun rings! Jason is SLAMMED into the HULL DOORS.

				DELONGPRE
		Holy shit!

	JASON jumps up and rushes at Kay-Em who catches him and tosses him down 
	the walkway --

	BRAAAATTT! Kay-Em opens up again. Kay-Em's weaponry shoves Jason out 
	into the cargo
	bay witha  blur of bullets.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				BOEMAN
		What are we waiting for?!!
		Come on!!

	Our heroes rush down the walkway toward the cargo bay. Boeman and 
	Delongpre go to
	work setting the charges.

				BOEMAN
			(to Janessa)
		Where the hell were you?!!

				JANESSA
		He came for me, I had to run!

				THORGAN
			(into mike)
		Kay-Em, you okay?

	INT. CARGO BAY

				KAY-EM 14
		Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.

	And with that, Kay-Em BLOWS the now standing Jason into another wall 
	with the laser 
	cannon.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

				BOEMAN
		Toss me a chip.

	Delongpre pulls a trinket from his pack and pitches it to Boeman.

				BOEMAN
		Thorgan, you're brilliant.
		Have I told you that lately?

	Thorgan is standing at the end of the walkway staring into the cargo 
	bay.
	He looks sad.

				THORGAN
			(quietly)
		See you around.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Kay-Em 14 marches toward the downed Jason, and starts singing an old Sea 
	Shanty.

				KAY-EM 14
		She's the Yellow Rose of Taegu,
		the girl that I adore. Her cunt
		it smells like cock juice; she's
		a good two-dollar whore. You may
		talk to me of Seoul girls or whores
		from Tokyo, but the yellow rose of 
		Taegu beats them all, I'd you know.

	BRATTTT!!!

	Kay-Em blows Jason into --

	INT. HALL BETWEEN LABS AND CARGO

	She kicks him down the long corridor.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO 

	The hull SCREAMS from the exterior pressure. The ship RUMBLES.

				BOEMAN
		I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.

				DELONGPRE
		Then stop talking and work faster!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Jason BURSTS through the debris that had been blocking the Lab!
	Kay-Em enters behind him.

				KAY-EM 14
			(still singing)
		She was a young and charming girl;
		her age was scarce sixteen.

	JASON rushes KAY-EM 14!

				KAY-EM 14
		She took me in and she kicked out
		a sailor and marine.

	KA-CHING!!!!

	His machete bounces off of Kay-Em's new armor.

				KAY-EM 14
		She had no titties on her chest;
		that didn't bother me,

	WHAM!

	Kay-Em 14 back hands Jason across the room. He crashes into the glass
	speciments. Goo and formaldehyde covering him.

				KAY-EM 14
		For what she had between her legs
		was big enough for three.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Boeman and Delongpre are finishing up.

				BOEMAN
		Okay, Janessa, give me your last charge.

	Janessa looks around, then --

				JANESSA
		I...I don't know what I did...

				DELONGPRE
		You lost the charge?

				JANESSA
		He was chasing me!

				RIZZO
		Can we blow it with just two?

				BOEMAN
		If we don't sever the hull completely
		she'll drag us down with her.

				DELONGPRE
		Then what do we do?!

				BOEMAN
		I don't know!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Kay-Em stands over Jason. And for the first time in ten films Jason is 
	in bad shape.
	But still climbs to his feet...slowly.

				KAY-EM 14
		Why you low life, scum sucking,
		rat dick blowing, sum bitch.
		Your mamma must'a had some huge balls.

	Of course, as anyone knows, you don't diss Jason's mother.

	Jason leaps, tacking Kay-Em 14! They roll into another glass case. 
	Glass, formaldehyde and specimens
	rain down on top of them.

	Having lost his machete, Jason BASHES at Kay-Em with his fists. OVER and 
	OVER. He
	catches a rhythm. Kay-Em is trapped below.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

				DELONGPRE
		Well, it was a good plan.

	They look at one another -- hopless. Then --

				BRODSKI(O.S.)
		You stupid bitch!

	Everyone jumps as Sergeant Brodski leans against the walkway door frame.
	He's bound his wounds with a make-shift tourniquet wrapped around his 
	mid-section.

				BRODSKI
		Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!

				BOEMAN
		Sergeant? We thought you were...

				BRODSKI
		Yeah, yeah.
			(to Janessa)
		Well, what have you got to say for yourself?

				JANESSA
		I don't know...sorry?

				RIZZO
		Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.

				BRODSKI
		Bomb?

				BOEMAN
		Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.

	The sergeant tosses his pack to the ground.

				BRODSKI
		How much you need?

	INT. LAB ONE

	WHAM...WHAM...WHAM... A RAIN of firststaking on this droid from the 
	future.

	Finally, Jason stops. Straddling KAy-Em 14 he stares at his kill...until 
	--

				KAY-EM 14
			(condescending)
		That was very good. You should
		feel very good about yourself
		right now. Good effort.
			(tough voice)
		How could you hit a girl you sumbitch?!

	Kay-Em 14 places the chaingun over Jason's chest.

	BRAAAATTTT!!!!

	Jason is blown across the room!

				KAY-EM 14
		Okay, dip shit. Time to finish
		you off so I can go home and boink
		your momma with a corndog. The kinky
		bitch.

	Chaingun and laser cannon UNLEASH A MASSIVE DISPLAY on the fleshly body 
	of
	JASON VOORHEES.

	The top portion of Jason's mask shatters!

	hIS RIGHT LEG IS TURNED INTO A PILE OF MEAT, then blown clean off for 
	good measure!
	Jason falls on his ass!

	He raises his machete arm. A last ditch effort. Could he be that lucky?
	To throw a machete and stop this onslaught?

	CHA-CHING!

	NOPE.

				KAY-EM 14
			(singing)
		Bang, bang Maxewells silver hammer
		came down upon his head. Doo-pee-
		do-do. Bang, bang Maxewell's silver
		hammer made sure that he was dead...

	Jason climbs to his one good leg but i t only serves as a better aim
	for Kay-Em 14.

	KA-FOOM! The laser cannon blows Jason's left arm to hell.

	KA-FOOM! KA-FOOM!

	Two more blasts send Jason flying through the back wall and sliding 
	across the floor.

	KAY-EM 14'S INTERNAL SCAN POV

	This time, Jason's body doesn't move.

	SUBJECT: DEAD
	CHANCE OF FUNCTION: ZERO PERCENT
	MISSION OF OBJECTIVES: COMPLERED

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh...my...god. What have I done?
			(crying)
		Thorgan!

	Kay-Em turns and races down the hall.

				KAY-EM 14
		Thorgan I'm a murderer!

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Boeman and Delongpre hustle to set the final charge.

				BRODSKI
		Blowing the walkway? You come up
		with that yourself?

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo did.

	CHA-CHUNG...CHA-CHUNG. Kay-Em steps into the walkway. She's covered in
	blood.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em!

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing back?!!

				KAY-EM 14
			(sad)
		Sumbitch won't be giving us
		anymore trouble.

				RIZZO
		You killed him?

				KAY-EM 14
			(regret)
		Blew half his skull away, one leg,
		one arm and left his entrails
		stretched across the lab. And look
		at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!

				THORGAN
		You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.

				KAY-EM 14
		A real mamma's boy that one.
		Dissed his mamma and he nearly
		threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.

				RIZZO
		His mother?

				BOEMAN
		What?

				RIZZO
		I don't know. Nothing.

	Suddenly the ship's hull SCREAMS. The ship BUCKS. Everyone tumbles.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry up people! We're running out
		of time.

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	Jason's body is propped up against a machine in the same position we saw 
	it before. This
	mass of torn flesh doesn't move.

	The ship BUCKS again.

	The machine HUMS to life. BUZZING and BEEPING. Suddenly a laser scans 
	Jason's
	body.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	Jason is leaned up against the Nano-Tech machine.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Thorgan runs wire to each device.

				THORGAN
		As long as they're connected we can 
		blow them all simultaneously from
		a safe distance.

				BOEMAN
		Two more charges to go.

	INT. LABE ONE - NANO-TECH MACHINE

	We see a schematic of Jason's battered body on the monitor. Nano-
	technology
	is already at work.

	Hoses and wires now encircle Jason's body. We follow one of the hoses 
	until it ends
	over --

	A WASTE BEND

	nside we see pile of bullets. Stuff falls from the hose. Bullets from 
	the chaingun,
	bullets from  every previous Jason movie. A broken machete blade drops 
	to the pile.
	The tip of an arrow. A couple of knives. A pair of pliers. An ink pen. 
	The skeleton
	of a fish.

	The scanning lasers move to the stump at Jason's shoulder. We see the 
	image as a new arm, fuzzy
	adn distorted, is being constructed.

	On the schematic, we see Jason's internal organs being repaired.

	By now  we've figured out ...nothing good can come of this.

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Kay-Em 14 hits a button. The door begins to slide down slowly.

				THORGAN
		Done!

				BOEMAN
		Let's move out!

				BRODSKI
		Kid, you ever thought about the marine corp?

	Delongpre calls fromthe far end of the walkway, welder in his hand.

				DELONGPRE
		I need another minute. Come on!

	ON OUR HEROES

	Suddenly there is a GRINDING SOUND. Engines WHINE from behind them.

	The group stops and turns.

	The cargo door is starting to smoke. It SQUEALS as it slowly opens.

				BRODSKI
		Well fuck me.

				KAY-EM 14
		No, fuck me.

	The door opens and Jason steps into the walkway.

	But he's no Jason we've ever seen before. His leg and arm are now
	SHINY METAL. His clothes are BLACK, no longer tattered. His mask is 
	CHROME.
	We can't see them, but we know...his insides are in better shape than 
	ever.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em? Re-engage killer instinct.

				KAY-EM 14
		Yeeee-haw!!!!

	BRAAAATTTTT!

	Kay-em firs. But, this time it doesn't seem to faze Jason. SPARKS fly as
	bullets vounce off of his metal limbs.

	Jason swings his new improved machete. It CLANGS off of Kay-Em's armor, 
	removing a hunk of metal.

	Jason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway. Glass CRACKS.
	One of the wires, connecting two charges severs.

				BOEMAN
		Shit!

	Kay-em does a back flip, kicking Jason in the chest. He's shoved 
	backwards.

	Boeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues.

	IT'S MASSIVE! Intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic 
	killer.
	SPARKS FLY. GUNFIRE SOUNDS. Then Kay-Em does a round house kick, but 
	Jason uses 
	his machete as a shield. Kay-Em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee.

	She stumbles...falls to the ground.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em!!!

	Boeman splices the wires together.

				BOEMAN
		Done!!

	Then turns to see Jason approaching.

				BOEMAN
		RUN!!

	But Jason's too close. He grabs Boeman.

	ON KAY-EM

	As her body separates from her legs mid-thigh. CHCHHHHH!
	THRUSTERS IGNITE from her lower thighs.

	As Jason raises his machete to do Boeman in --

	KA-FWAM! Kay-Em slams into him! Knocking Boeman free.

	Jason and the now hovering Kay-Em go at it again.

	CHANG! CLANG! CLUNK! Metal against metal. Kay-Em hovers up the walls, 
	over Jason's 
	head...but Jason has come into his own with these new body parts. She's 
	no match. Finally --

	JASON EMBEDS HIS MACHETE IN KAY-EM'S THROAT

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason rears back and shoves his fist though Kay-Em's chestplate! his 
	fist from Kay-Em's
	chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em! Get away!

	Thorgan moves toward his robotic love but Boeman grabs him and pulls him 
	down
	the hall.

				KAY-EM 14
		That's the best you can do?

	Jason yanks his machete from the side of Kay-Em's neck. Severing her 
	head
	from her body. It flies down the hallway behind the kids.

				KAY-EM 14
		Is that it? Come back and fight like a man!

	JASON 

	Turns his glare on our heroes racing toward Delongpre at the other end.

	DELONGPRE

				DELONGPRE
		Done!

	Delongpre lifts his welder's mask to call to the others when he sees 
	JASON.

				DELONGPRE
		Shit, hurry!

	OUR HEROES

	Run toward the door. But, Thorgan stops.

				BOEMAN
		What...?

	Thorgan turns, runs back toward Jason.

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing?!!

	Thorgan is running to retrieve Kay-Em 14's head. It lies between he and 
	Jason.
	He'll never make it!  Thorgan hits the floor, slides and scoops up the 
	head.

				KAY-EM 14
		I think I'm going to throw up...

	BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

	Jason raises his machete from his belt and --

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Hey, dickhead!

	JASON TURNS AS --

	KA-CHUNG!!!! Rizzo nails him with a metal ar.

				RIZZO
			(to Thorgan)
		Go!

	Jason stumbles backwards then whirls on Rizzo.

				RIZZO
		Oh, yeah, you remember me.

	He sure does.

	She turnsa dn runs.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As the others race into the engien room they turn to watch.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry!

				DELONGPRE
		Faster! Don't we have another gun?

	Rizzo catches up to Thorgan but they have a long way to go
	and Jason is gaining.

				JANESSA
		They're not gonna make it. Close the door
		before he gets us all.

				DELONGPRE
		They'll make it.

				JANESSA
		Close the fucking door!

				DELONGPRE
		NO!

	JANESSA leaps forward and hits the switch. The door begins sliding 
	slowly shut.

				DELONGPRE
		Damnit!

	Boeman hits the button again.

				DELONGPRE
			(glares at Janessa)
		Forget it. I had to rewire it.
		Once it's started it won't stop.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	JASON

	TWENTY PACES BEHIND

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

				DELONGPRE
		Get ready to blow it.

	Rizzo dives, slides under the closing door.

	Thorgan follows her lead, but his slide doesn't have the same force. He 
	stops with the door
	coming down on his lower back.

	Luckily, Delongpre snatches his arms and yanks him through.

	The door closes!

				DELONGPRE
		Now!

	Boeman turns the switch.

	INT.  MIDSHIP WALK WAY

	The charges BLOW! A FIREBALL rushes toward the running JASON!

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

	CLOSE ON DOOR

	AS KA-FWAM!!!

	JASON'S BODY IMPRINTS IN THE NOW SEALED DOOR.

	EXT. GRENDEL

	The walkway explodes, severing Grendel into two separate hulls. 
	The left damaged hull, sinks out of view as the engine side begins
	to pull away. Then --

	KA-FOOM!!

	Grendel's LEFT HULL finallay EXPLODES!! They barely amde it.

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

	The right hull BUCKS from the force of the blast. Our heroes are 
	aireborne for a moment 
	then crash to the floor.

				BRODSKI
		Damage?

	Boeman climbs to a console.

				BOEMAN
		Minimal.

				RIZZO
		We made it?

				DELONGPRE
		I think...I think maybe we did.

	CHEERS

	Thorgan looks into Kay-Em 14's severed head.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em we made it!

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh, goody. I'm so pleased.
		I'd clap if I could.

	Boeman CLICKS on a console keyboard.

				BOEMAN
		I've changed the course for Earth II.
		And I sent a distress signal.

				VOICE(V.O.)
		Roger, Grendel. What's the problem?

				BOEMAN
			(into mike)
		Our ship has been damaged, most of
		the crew dead. We need evac.

				VOICE
		Copy that Grendel. Rescue enroute.
		You should hit EARTH II orbit in fifteen
		minutes. Rescue ETA twenty minutes.

	CHEERS!

				BOEMAN
		We're going home people.

	More CHEERS.

	Rizzo turns to find Delonpre staring at her.

				DELONGPRE
			(big smile)
		See? We're not so bad.

				RIZZO
		Not so bad.

	There's that moment when we think the two might kiss. She takes a step
	toward him. Yes, they are going to kiss --

	BOOM!

	WARNING LIGHTS. WARNING ALARMS. The sound of SUCKING WIND. AS JASON,
	still very alive shoves his fist through the imprinted door with his
	metal hand!

	As he rips a bigger hole to gain entrance our heroes are fighting to 
	hold
	on to anything.

	The Hole is sucking everything not tied down out into space.

	Boeman is the first to reach the reactor room door.

				BOEMAN
		This way!

	He pulls Sergeant Brodski through the door as -- 

	JASON

	Fights his way through the opening in the hull.

	The engines BUCK and begin to SMOKE.

				BOEMAN
		The pressures cause the engines to overheat!
		Hurry!

	Delongpre helps Rizzo and Thorgan to safety.

	Janessa crawls across the floor digging her fingers into the steel mesh.

	SERGEANT BRODKSI

	Lying in the door's threshold reaches out and snags her hand.

				JANESSA
		Pull me in!

				BRODSKI
		I'm pulling, damnit!

	But Jason grabs Janessa's ankle and jerks. She's pulled from the 
	Sergeant's
	grasp.

	She flops around in the sucking wind as Jason watches. He lets go.

	She flies toward the hole, slams into it.

	Everything goes quiet for a moment. As he body has sealed the hole then 
	--

	SHHHHHHHHOOOOOK!

	She's sucked into space in a most grotesque manner.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				BRODSKI
		Well, that's a shame.

	INT. REACTOR CORE

	Hug cylindrical machines run the length of this enormous room.
	They HUM quietly as our group enters.

				BRODSKI
		We need weapons.

				RIZZO
		Weapons? All this technology and
		what good has it done?!

				DELONGPRE
		It bought us some time.

				BOEMAN
		And now we're all out of it.

	Everyone stares at Boeman. He's standing at another console.

				BOEMAN
		The ship's depressurizing, the engines
		overheating. When it  reaches the core,
		we're done.

				RIZZO
		Done?

				THORGAN
		Kaboom.

				DELONGPRE
		Again?! Jesus!

				RIZZO
		Why am I not surprised?

	Thorgan still clutches Kay-Em 14's severed head.

				KAY-EM 14
		You must shut down the engines.

				DELONGPRE
		Then do it. The rescue ship can
		find us here right?

				BRODSKI
		Can't shut em' down from here.

				BOEMAN
		Somebody's gonna have to go back
		to the engine room.

				DELONGPRE
		You ain't catching my ass in there again.

	Brodski, still bleeding, pale, struggling to stand --

				BRODSKI
		I'll go.

	The kids give him the "are you crazy?" stare.

				BOEMAN
		You're too weak. I'll go.

	KA-FWAM! Everyone jumps but this time it's only Rizzo. She broke a metal 
	stand and has
	yanked one of the legs free.

				RIZZO
		You know, this future shit sucks.
		I'll fucking do it.

				DELONGPRE
		You?

				RIZZO
			(mumbling)
		Wait around on your asses all day.
			(turns to Thorgan)
		I'll need a distraction.

				THORGAN
		What kind of a distraction?

	INT. ENGINE ROOM

	JASON is pounding on the reactor room door. A difficult act with the 
	continued pressure 
	trying to suck him into space.

	THEN
				RIZZO
		HEY!

	Jason turns to find Rizzo standing in the doorway behind him. 

				RIZZO
		You want some of me?

	Jason whirls around and lurches toward her clinging to machinery as he 
	goes.


	INT.  ENGINE ROOM CORRIDOR

	Rizzo backs slowly as Jason closes in.

	As he reaches the corridor, she turns and runs.

	RIZZO

				RIZZO
		Come on, keep up.

	Jason barrels toward her.

				RIZZO
		You want some of me or not?

	She stops at a door, but doesn't attmept ot open it.

	Jason comes closer..and closeer...but Rizzo doesn't move --

	Jason moves in for the kill, raises his machete, and --

				RIZZO
		Take your best shot --

	SLASH!

	RIZZO'S CHEST IS SPLIT OPEN!

				RIZZO
			(laughs)
		I'm melting! I'm melting!

	SLASH! Her arm falls to the ground!

				RIZZO
		See now that was stupid.
		Persistent, yes, but stupid.

	Jason shoves his fist, through her chest and into the wall.

				RIZZO
		Not this time, asshole. This time
		I'm gonna watch you burn in hell.

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

	The real RIZZO rips off her virtual reality helmet.

				RIZZO
		Make it fast. He's coming.

	Delongpre is punching numbers into the keypad. Both are wearing 
	headsets.

				DELONGPRE
		Almost got it.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Jason returns to the engine room, none too pleased at being tricked.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue
		ship on radar.

				RIZZO
		Delongpre! Out of time!

				DELONPRE
		Got it!

	Rizzo jersk Delonpre and both spill into the reactor
	corridor. Rizzo slaps the panel. the door closes!
	Shutting out Jason's image.

				DELONGPRE
		Damn that was close!

	WHAM!

	THE ENGINE ROOM door RIPS in half. JASON CLIMBS through.

	RIZZO AND DELONGPRE RUN!

				RIZZO
			(into radio)
		Guys, he's right behind us!

		THORGAN(V.O.)
		It's okay.

		DELONGPRE
		Okay?!!

		THORGAN(V.O.)
		Just come on, I've got an idea.

	They race down the long corridor toward the reactor room.
	JASON IN PURSUIT.

	INT. DOCKING BAY

	Thorgan is typing like mad at small portable keyboard.
	Boeman stares out the docking bay window.

	HIS POV 

	There's damage, lots of it.

				BOEMAN
			(into radio)
		The docking bay was damaged after the
		explosion. Meet us at the airlock.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM corridor.

				DELONGPRE
		Got it.
			(to Rizzo)
		You ever space walked?

				RIZZO
		Oh sure, all the time.

	They leap through a door, closing it behind them, then keep running.

	BEHIND THEM

	KA-FWAM! Jason barrels right through the door.

				RIZZO
			(into headset)
		Damit, Thorgan, whatever you're doing...
		you'd better hurry!
			(growls)
		I hate the future!

	INT.  REACTOR CORE

	Rizzo and Delongpre enter in a  mad rush. Delongpre closes the door.
	Little good it'll do.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM CORRIDOR

	JASON kicks the door with his metallic leg!

	KA-FWAM! The door shatters and he stumlbes into --

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Forest, cabins, the lake. Everything as we and Jason remember.
	But somehow distroted. A strange hue covers everything.

	No, on second look, it's not exactly the way we remember. The trees are
	strange looking. Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut, but something 
	foreign.
	The cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a 
	camp.
	But the image will do.
					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Thorgan stands at a keyboard clicking away. Boeman is wearing a space 
	suit.
	He's helping sergeatn Brodski into his.

	At the other end of the huge room, Jason wanders ... with confusion.

				THORGAN
		Don't worry. He can't see us.

	Rizzo glances out the docking bay window.

				RIZZO
		Is that...?

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	We see a planet much the same color as Earth, but the continents are 
	wrong.

				DELONGPRE
		Earth II.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Suit up.

	Delongpre leads Rizzo to a suit.

				DELONGPRE
		I'll help you in.

				THORGAN
			(into headset)
		Kay-Em, you've saved our lives,
		you know that don't you?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kay-Em 14's head sits on the floor in the center of room.

				KAY-EM 14
		It was my pleasure, my love.
		Perhaps if all works for the best
		you can rebuild me and we can try that
		doggie style thing again.

	DOCKING BAY

	The others stare at Thorgan...he looks embarrassed to say the least.

				DELONGPRE
		I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.

	ON KAY-EM

				KAY-EM 14
			(singing happily)
		I get no kick from champaign, mere
		alcohol doesn't faze me at all,
		but I get a kick out of you.

				THORGAN
			(under his breath)
		Goodbye, my love.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thorgan, suit up.

				THORGAN
			(to Rizzo)
		This is gonna work. If he sticks to the
		program. Will he? Stick to the program?

				RIZZO
		His mother was killed before his eyes.
		That's what drove him insane. It'll work.

				DELONGPRE
		That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of
		that future shit.

				RIZZO
		Eat me.

	She smiles as she jersk the helmet out of his hand.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason slowly walks beside Kay-Em 14.

					QUICK-CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Jason is walking along the lake when he sees --

	A CAMPFIRE off in the distance. LAUGHTER, SINGING.
	CAMPERS!!!

	He takes off toward the campfire, then hears --

	SPLASHING. 

	He turns.

	HIS POV

	Within the distorted lake, someone is drowning. Could it be a little 
	boy?
	A little Jason from many years ago?

				WOMAN
		Help me!
			(gurgles)
		Jason help me!

	JASON

	Moves toward the beach. Steps partly into the water.

	HIS POV

	THE WOMAN, THE VOICE. IT'S JASON'S MOTHER!

	He turns toward the campfire, back to his mother...what to do?! Then --

	JASON TEARS INTO THE WATER, TRYING TO REACH HER.

				MRS. VOORHEES
		Help me, Jason, please! Help your mother!

	Jason moves closer.

				MRS. VOORHEES
		Don't let me die again!

	As he draws near, she reaches out her hands to him.

	JASON

	Pauses staring at the please for help.

	He stares into her pleading face. HIS MOTHER! After all these years!

	He places his hand over her face, gently, then --

	PUSHES HER UNDER!

	He holds her there.

								QUICK-CUT TO:

	INT. REACTOR ROOM

				KAY-EM 14
		Uh-oh. That's not a part of the program.
		Thorgan, we've got a problem!

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE 

	Camp Cyrstal lake begins to jerk and fade.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Everyone is suited up. Delongpre, the last, is adjusting his helmet.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Oh, shit. He's going to see us.

				DELONGPRE
		Well, do something!

	Thorgan grabs the portable keyboard and starts typing away!

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Suddenly the image solidifies then a number of the aliens from the game
	grid appear. But Jason's seen these guys before. He tears through them.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

				THORGAN
		Shit!

	Boeman hits the door panel to the docking bay. It begins to slowly rise.

				BOEMAN
		Just a little more time.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Jason stands atop a pile of dead alien like some strange Conan in space.
	The image flickers...he  catches a glimpse of our heroes at the end fo 
	the 
	room. He starts toward them.

	Then a huge white fluffy bunny with huge breasts appears before him.

				WHITE FLUFFY BUNNY
			(sings; deep african american voice)
		I'm'a big fluffy bunny...a big white fluffy bunny...

	SWISH! The bunny's head is severed. The image distortss. Again we see 
	our 
	heroes. Jason is closer.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	The door is halway open. Our heroes start ducking under.

	Jason is almost on them.

				RIZZO
		Thorgan!!!!

	He's clicking away like a mad man.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	A ROCK BAND appears playing some futuristic metal. Then CHEERLEADERS in 
	scantily clad outfits. Then a MIDGIT in a cowboy hat riding by on a 
	tricycle. We have now entered Thorgan's twisted streams of conciousness.

	Jason tears through the aboe. His goal now clear. The distractions no
	longer fool him.

	A volley ball court appears with naked girls bouncing around.
	A fat man wearing only a spiked leather Speedo. A huge turtle.
	A couple of goats.

	Nothing is stopping Jason.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Boeman reaches out and jerks Thorgan into the inner air lock.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	The image finally disintergrates.

	Jason finds himself staring at our heroes. He lunges for the air lock, 
	but --

	Sergeant Brodski dives, hitting Jason in the chest and knocking him to 
	the
	floor.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Sergeant!

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Get out of here!

	SERGEANT BRODSKI, still in Jason's clutches, kicks at the door panel.

	The door starts to close as Jason begins hacking with his machete.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		That all you got?!!

	Jason hacks and hack, stabbing through the space suit, until finally, 
	the tough
	old leather neck is silent for good.

	INT.  AIR LOCK

	The door is sealed.

				RIZZO
		He saved our lives.

	Boemen hits another button, and the outer door begins to open.

				DELONGPRE
		Boeman, the ships not here.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Use the thrusters and you'll
		be fine. We'll huddle together
		out there.

	EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF THE GRENDEL

	AS THE OUTER DOOR OPENS, RIZZO UNCOMFORTABLY FIDGETS WITH HER SUIT.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Hey, easy now.

	He points to where her hand hovers over some buttons on her sleeve.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You wanna release your air tanks?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(nervous)
		Okay, good tip.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You'll be fine.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters.
		We'll be fine.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around.
		So far so good.

	WHAM!

	Jason starts pounding from the other side.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Don't worry. He can't get through that door.

	Delongpre's right. This isn't some thin interior door or some
	walkway door reinforced by a high school kid. This is an air lock
	door. Built to withstand laser cannons and meteors.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thrusters.

	CHSHSHSHSH. CHSHSH.

	Our group enters deep space.

	EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF GRENDEL

	Rizzo, Thorgan, Boeman and Delongpre look tiny next to the massive
	right hull. They thrust slowly into space.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, you okay?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		No I'm not okay! I don't
		know what the hell I'm doing!

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You're doing fine. I won't let
		anything happen to you, remember?

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT. DOCKING BAY

	Jason finally gives up with the massive pounding. He steps back.
	Turns, stares at the sergeants' dead body, then looks at --

	THE DOOR PANEL

	He preses the button

	the ari lock door begins to open. Air is suddenly sucked out of the 
	room!

	Sergeant Brodski's body flies out into space. Everything not tied down 
	races out 
	along with him.

	ON KAY-EM 14'S HEAD

	AS it skitters across the floor --

				KAY-EM 14
		Ahhhhh!

	-- and right out the air lock

	JASON 

	holds onto a machine until the door is open, then lets go!
	He shoots out into space.

	EXT. GRENDEL

	Jason flies out of the air lock.

	HIS POV

	He's rocketing right toward one of the space suits!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I think I had some when I was eight.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Did you like it?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I think so, why?

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		He's trying to ask you out on a date.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Shut up, Thorgan!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Delongpre, you don't even know me.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		I know you.

	Suddenly Rizzo is SLAMMED from behind. She and Jason go spinning away 
	from
	the others.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Nooooooo!!

	RIZZO

	grapples with Jason, but JASON IS JUST TOO STRONG.

	Jason holds HER with his good hand and REARS his metallic hand back. 
	He's
	going to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her 
	head,
	when --

	WHAM!

	Delongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms
	sticking through one of Rizzo's harnesses. THe three go tumbling.

	Delongpre clings to Jason's back.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, pull away!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I'm stuck!

	Jason reaches back, grabs Delongpre and jersk him over his head until 
	he's holding Delongpre
	around the thoat. He'll pop his helmet like a cork!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	AS Thorgan and Boeman thrust towards the tumbling mass...

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		We're too far away!

	BACK TO JASON

	AS he tightens his grip around Delongpre's neck. He can't fight back.

	RIZZO is fighting to untangle her harness. We can hear
	Delongpre CHOKING over the radio.

	The three are spinning even closer and closer towards EARTH II.

	Then, Rizzo reaches down. She grabs Delongpre's leg and CLICKS a button 
	on her sleeve.

	KA-CHSSHSH!!!

	HER AIR TANK BLOWS!

	JASON IS THROWN OFF OF THEM!

	But he's still tangled in Rizzo's hoses. And now she has no air.

	Jason turns...grabs the hoses and begins pulling himself
	toward Rizzo and Delongpre.

	He has them...when --

	WHAM!

	BRODSKI

	Still barely alive barrels into Jason, vlinging to his back.
	He turns, slashes with his knife and severs the hoses.

	Jason and Brodski tumble towards EARTH II.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo's turning blue. She's about to pass out, when --

	Delongpre pulls a hose from his suit and hooks it into her tank.

	CHSHSHSH...

	AIR BEGINS TO FLOW.

	Rizzo takes a big GASP...coughs.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You okay?!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(breathing steadily)
		Oh great...yeah, having a great
		time, and you?

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		No thank you, you crazy old woman.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Old woman?

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Well I mean, technically you are old
		enough to be my great, great, great...

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I get it.

	Suddenly Boeman and Thorgan grab them.  The four survivors huddle 
	together.

				KAY-EM 14
		Hello? A little assistance here?

	They turn to see Kay-Em's head floating close by. Thorgan graps at her 
	and pulls
	her head into his arms.

	THE GROUP CHEERS.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Kay-em you okay?

				KAY-EM 14
		I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I missed you too.

				KAY-EM 14
		I love you.

	Those two aren't the only two.

	CLOSE ON RIZZO AND DELONGPRE

	Their glass face masks are touching. They stare into each other's 
	eyes.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Chinese, huh?

	They laugh and turn to stare toward EARTH II.

	EXT.  EARTH II -- ORBIT

	Suddenly Jason's body comes into view. It's racing toward Earth II.
	Brodski riding it like Slim Pickens.

				BRODSKI
		Yeee---Haaaaa!!

	Slowly they begin entering the atmosphere.

	Immediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone. He was a good
	man...stay to the end to make sure the job was done right.

	Spread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, Jason continues his
	descent.

	His fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up.
	It begins to glow. His metallic arm and leg glow.

	Flames build as he rockets towards Earth II.

	Flesh BUBBLES and OOZES.

	His legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from his 
	body!

	EXT.  CAMP SIGHT

	Four kids sit on futuristic sleeping bags around an old fashion 
	campfire.

				KID # 1
		Hey! Check that out!

	They look up and see a blaze shooting towards Earth II.

				KID # 2
		A falling star!

				KID # 3
		It's a meteor dickhead.

				KID # 2
		It's still cool.

	It LIGHTS up the night, then --

	EXPLODES IN A BRILLIANT FIREWORKS DISPLAY!

				KID # 1
		Cool!!!

	From the explosion, one small smoldering chunk falls toward Earth II.

	EXT.  CRYSTAL RESERVOIR

	OUR POV

	As the chunk falls closer and closer we see that it is a glowing chrome
	hockey mask!

	IT HITS THE WATER with a SSSSS!!!!

	BACK TO KIDS

				KID # 4
		Damn! It his the reservoir.

				KID # 1
		Let's go check it out!

	The others agree as they grab their flashlights and head in toward what
	could be a wonderful new discovery.

								DISSOLVE INTO:

	A STREAM.

	The hockey mask washes down the stream, comes to a halt at a pair of
	grusomely charred hands. 

	THE FINGERS,

	TWITCH, curl around the mask, lifting it off camera. AND WE --

	FADE OUT, a familiar KI-KI-KI-KI-HA-HA-HA-HA, resonating as we --

	ROLL CREDITS

	THE END
JASON-X
	BY TOD FARMER
	REVISED ROUGH DRAFT
	MAY 24, 1999

	FADE IN:

	DARKNESS.

	A scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we SHOCK CUT INTO -

	MONTAGE of fast moving clips.  Death, destruction, fear.  All images 
	taken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths.  

	AGAIN, DARKNESS.

								OPEN ON:

	The year is 2455. The place is Old Earth. Barren, void of life, a 
	hazardous and violent planet. The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of 
	dark gray.  It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign.

	BLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM 
	below. 

	Small groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work 
	nearby. Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings 
	with strange devices.

	This is an archeological expedition.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  DARK PLACE

	The dust storm rages outside. Two figures are looking closely at a small 
	object buried in the dirt. One of them pulls a device out of their pouch 
	and slowly, gently picks up the object. The other uses a magnetic tool 
	to remove the dirt.

				FEMALE VOICE
		Careful . . .

				MALE VOICE
		I know.

	They take off their masks and goggles. They are both young. ADRIENNE 
	female (17) watches as STONEY male (18) studies the object closely.

				STONEY
			(reading)
		Not guaranteed, if used After 2198.

	CLOSE UP of the object. It's an unopened condom.

				ADRIENNE
			(smiles)
		You thinking what I'm thinking?

	Stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open 
	the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	They are in a half buried mini-van.  It rocks violently from the raging 
	storm outside and from the raging lust inside.

	BACK INSIDE THE VAN.

				ADRIENNE
			(breathless)
		What about Kkinsa?

	STONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra.

				STONEY
		It's over between us. You're the
		only one for me!

	METAL SCREECHES! THE FLOOR COLLAPSES!

	They fall some ten feet, RUBBLE RAINING down on top of them.

	INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

	A rusty metal ladder. Debris everywhere. Half inch layers of dust cover 
	everything. Dead. Lifeless.

				STONEY
		You okay?

	Adrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. She 
	turns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder.

	SHE SCREAMS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM.

	We PULL BACK, out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the 
	storm drown out ADRIENNE'S SCREAM.

								CUT TO:
	EXT.  BASE CAMP

	The digging and readings have stopped. A group approaches a time scarred 
	shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly.

	FAT LOU (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of 
	the shuttle ramp.

				FAT LOU
			(yelling over the wind)
		Let's go! Time to load up!

	YLLO(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil. 

				YLLO
			(yelling)
		I'm missing two!

				FAT LOU
		Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have
		left this rock an hour ago!

				BOEMAN
			(eyes a device)
		North three clicks.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MINI-VAN - DAY

	YLLO and the rest of the group run into view. BOEMAN (18), husky, 
	physical; holds out a device and checks the reading.

	He points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly.

				BOEMAN
			(yelling)
		There!

	KICKER(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic 
	military garb -

				KICKER
		Yo, Teach, what the fuck?

				YLLO
		We're missing two of the kids!

				KICKER
		Get your ass back to the shuttle.
		I'll check it out.

	KICKER moves past the group and into the Van.

				YLLO
		Not without me!

	The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van.

	INT. ANCIENT CORRIDOR

	YLLO and the others climb down a rusted ladder. Metallic walls, 
	graffiti, cluttered floors. No Stoney or Adrienne. A sign from the 
	ceiling states -

	CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY.

	They all take off the goggles and masks. The rest of the group consists 
	of DELONGPRE(18) good looking, smart ass; JANESSA(17) sexual, scheming 
	AZRAEL(17) SMALL, COCKY; KKINSA(16), insecure, problematic; 
	THORGAN(17), a nerd but doesn't know it.

				YLLO
		Amazing! But, how . . I've been coming
		here for ten years. We never picked this up on
		our . . . KAY-EM?

	KAY-EM 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil. She's 
	gorgeous, but there's something off about her look. Something synthetic.

				KAY-EM 14
		The air's laced with type two ozone,
		it reads as a solid.

				THORGAN
		Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.

				KAY-EM 14
		In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved
		their facilities underground to escape . . .

				KICKER
		All right, all right, enough with the history
		lesson. Lets find these two quick . . so I can kick
		some little punk ass.

	Kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.

				KKINSA
		I have an idea, why don't you go find
		them and we'll get the hell out of here!

	KKINSA turns and finds herself face to face with - -

	A CORPSE! Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled 
	through the forehead by an iron spike. 

	KKINSA SCREAMS!

	Kicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as 

	JANESSA falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. She screams! 

	KAY-EM 14 SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Everyone looks at the droid.

				KAY-EM 14
		Was that out loud?

				DELONGPREE
		Thorgan, have you been screwing with . . .

	THORGAN grabs the head off the CORPSE, with the spike through it's head.

				THORGAN
		Cool! This is an automatic "A".

	Azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some 
	cds, and an ancient box of PLAYTEX . . . starts shoving the corpse into 
	his pack.
				AZRAEL
		I've got my project. What are you losers
		gonna do?

				KICKER
		Back to the shuttle! All of you!
		I'll find them.

				YLLO
		Relax, Soldier boy, this is amazing.
		These remains are two hundred years old.

	Yllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling. DANGER. STAY OUT.

				BOEMAN
		Creepy.

				THORGAN
		Cool.

				KKINSA
		Okay, I'm outta here.

				YYLO
		Kay-Em, any thoughts?

				KAY-EM 14
		Girth is better than length and
		women prefer a shaved scrotum during
		oral sex.

	Yllo glares a Thorgan.

				THORGAN
		I'm trying to give her some personality.

				YLLO
		Well stop messing with her. I don't want
		a science droid with a personality. Now
		let's find them and get back. I want to
		get clearance to stay back and study this . . .

				KKINSA
		No way! I'm not staying here any longer . . .
		I have a life you know.

	A radio crackles.

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze!
		Get your ass back hre!

				YLLO
			(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it.
		You won't believe what we found.
			(calls out)
		Adrienne! Stoney!

	Yllo rushes past the corpse. The others reluctantly follow. They pass 
	another hanging sign - Danger - THEY PASS ANOTHER CORPSE LYING ON THE 
	FLOOR, it's torso separated from it's legs. And this is just the 
	beginning. As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.

				BOEMAN
		There was a hall of a battle down here.

	S they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. A WARNING 
	VOICE sounds.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Dan-danger. Do not enter-er.

	But the group keeps moving. 

				KKINSA
		I feel compelled to ask why we are
		ignoring that.

	A corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a 
	warning written in ancient blood . . .

	HELP ME . . .

	Suddenly another CORPSE LEAPS at them, screaming like a banshee! 
	Everyone SCREAMS - It lands on Kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get 
	the corpse off her. 

	DELONGPREE and YLLO help Kkinsa fight the rotting corpse. They hear 
	hysterical laughter and look up to see -

	ADRIENNE and STONEY . . . emerge from the shadows laughing 
	uncontrollably.

				DELONGPREE
		Damnit!

				YLLO
		What the hell are you two doing?!

	Kkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney.

				KKINSA
		You're toast, mister.

				YLLO
		You're both toast!

				ADRIENNE
		You gotta see this!

	They turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of 
	a jumbled mess of jagged metal.

				THORGAN
			(re: ceiling)
		That's a strange design, don't you think?

				KICKER
		We don't have time for this shit.

	As they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and 
	squeeze together. That can't be a good thing . . .

	STONEY and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door. Above the door . . . 
	CRYOGENICS LAB.

	Adrienne points to a small window in the door.

				DELONGPREE
		Yeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year.

				ADRIENNE
		Check it out.

	With a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in 
	the door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning -

	A SKULL AND CROSSBONES 

				KKINSA
		So don't open the door.

				ADRIENNE
		Look beyond it, yesterday's news.

	Yllo pushes his way to the window.

	Shocked faces.

	INSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's 
	massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled 
	up into a ball, is a body - female, young.

				YLLO
		Is that?

				KAY-EM 14
		The room's still operational.
		She's perfectly preserved.

	Yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio.

				YLLO
			(into radio)
		Fat Lou, bring the ship to the
		following coordinates. Call Grendel,
		have them power up the labs, we're bringing
		in the find of the century!

				KICKER
		Now wait a minute! I don't think you
		should open that door.

				YLLO
		This is a science excursion corporal.
		Just stay out of the way.

	Yllo turns to the kids. He's very excited.

				YLLO
		Okay, no screwing around. This is the real
		thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, 
		open it up.

	Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.

				KKINSA
		You're opening the door?
		What about the . . . ?

	She points to the skull and crossbones. 

				DELONGPREE
		I'm thinking we should call in some
		experts.

				YLLO
		This is your find people. You want to
		give your credit away?

				DELONGPREE
		I was just saying . . .

				THORGAN
		The cryo unit leaked. The computers
		sealed the room. No airborne viruses
		no hazardous materials. I've shut down the
		until. Alright, stand back. 

				KAY-EM 14
		Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses
		will render you unconcious.

				DELONGPREE
		Knock you on your ass pal. 

	They don their face masks as  . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door 
	cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes 
	with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice 
	crystals crack and fall to the floor.

	EXT.  CRYO CELL

				YLLO
		Kay-Em!

	Kay moves into the room ahead of the others.

	INT.  CRYO CELL

	CLOSE ON KAY-EM'S EYES

	They are not human. Mechanical, digital, but alluring. They dilate, open 
	up. Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the 
	body.

	--which itself is slumped over. An icicle of frozen blood from, the 
	wound in her shoulder, props the body up.

	The other enter the icy chamber.

				DELONGPREE
		I speak on behalf of the group
		when I say . . . that's fucked.

				KAY-EM 14
		Female, nineteen years old, eight months . . .
		34-26-34 . . . bitch is built like a brick
		shit house.

				YLLO
		Thorgan?!!!

				THORGAN
		Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back.

				KAY-EM 14
		Time of hibernation 2049.
		Crystallization at seventeen percent.
		Suggest extensive Nanotech. Chances of
		rejuvenation eight-one percent.

				KKINSA
		What's going on?

				DELONGPREE
		She's dying.

				JANESSA
		Bitch looks dead to me.

	The RADIO CRACKLES . . .

				SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Yllo, Sergeant Brodski. Get your ass
		back to the shuttle!!

				YLLO
		Janessa, stretcher.
			(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on, sergeant. We have
		a medical emergency here not tot mention the
		discovery of a lifetime.

				SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Kicker! Get them the hell out of there!

	Janessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a 
	flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground.

	Kicker grabs Yllo.

				KICKER
		We're outta here!

	Yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of 
	blood and -CRACK-breaks it off.

				YLLO
		Fine, grab that end.


	Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled 
	body on the stretcher.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit -

				THORGAN
		Hey check this out!

	Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete.

				THORGAN
		This caused the leak and there's an
		occupant. 

	Thorgan yanks the door open.

				KICKER
		Don't touch that!

	Gas rolls out. Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE.

				KKINSA
		This is bad, no?

				THORGAN
		Relax, it's only a  glitch in the
		system. 

				JANESSA
		First field trip and you think
		you're a Scientist. Move out of the
		way geek. 

	JANESSA moves to look inside the chamber. 

	As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE, see a 
	jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. A chunk 
	of ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES 
	looms forward!

	JANESSA screams as JASON'S BODY, stiff as a board, CRASHES to the ground 
	sending ice shrapnel everywhere!

				DELONGPREE
		Jesus, used to make the suckers big
		didn't they?

	Again, Kay-Em's eyes scan the frozen body.

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject was dead prior to incubation.

	Yllo moves to get a good look at Jason.

				YLLO
		My God, look at him. Why would they freeze
		a dead body?
			(a beat)
		Alright, load him up, and let's get out
		of here!

	OVER HIS SHOULDER - HALL

	A pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor.

	BACK INSIDE 

	One of Boeman's gadgets starts to BEEP.

				BOEMAN
		Er, guy? I'm picking up some movement.

	FZZZZT . . . Azrael screams as a laser slices into the room. His left 
	arm falls to the ground!

	Kay-Em rushes to him. Her finger pops open. A needle appears. She 
	injects him. The drugs take immediate effect.

				AZRAEL
		Cool . . . check out my arm.

	CLINK - CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

	HALL

	The metallic spiders, lasers attached to their bodies, CLANK towards our 
	heroes. 

				YLLO
		Kicker!

				KICKER
		Defense droids. I'm on it.

	Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.


				KKINSA
		There goes prom night.

	Kicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm.

				KICKER
		They're only class two. I can
		handle this. No problem.

				AZRAEL
		Not a problem?!

	Kay-Em injects him again.

				AZRAEL
		I'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr-
			(re:shot)
		Oh, that's dreamy.

	The lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges.

				JANESSA
		Okay rent-a-cop, do your shit.
		I gotta date tonight.

				KICKER
		Stand back!

	He pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons.

				YLLO
		We have to get these two back in one piece!

	Kay-Em turns to the frozen girl.

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject is critical. Needs nano stabilization
		immediately.

				YLLO
		Kicker! Do something!

				ADRIENNE
		Oh Gawd! I wish it would stop doing that.

	At her feet, Azrael's arm twitches spastically.

				AZRAEL
			(drugged up)
				That is soooo cool!

	Kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget.

	KAFOOM!

				KICKER
				Come on!

	Kicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids 
	follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear 
	around the bend - towards the exit.

	A beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view. Behind them - -

	CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

	A dozen laser wielding spiders make chase! Some are old and rusty, other 
	slump over and short out, but those that work . . . work well.

	INT.  LONG CORIDOOR

	Kicker is running backwards, BLASTING with his weapon. Lasers FLASHING 
	all around our group. 


				KKINSA
		Have I told you guys how much I hate this class?

				KICKER
		We need another exit! I'll hold 'em off!
		Teach, find a way out!

				BOEMAN
		I'm on it!

				KICKER
		Sorry kid, leave this to the pros.

				BOEMAN
			(re: gadget)
		Left at the end of the hall!

	A laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice.

				THORGAN
			(reading from device)
		They're not after us. Their sensors are
		locked in on . . . him!

	Thorgan points to JASON'S STRETCHER.

				KICKER
		Leave him behind!

				YLLO
		No! He's coming with us!

	They round a corner . . .

				BOEMAN
		Here. We're one meter from the surface!

				KICKER
		Then duck.

	CHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling.

	KABLOOM!! Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above.

				DELONGPREE
		It's too high!

	Kicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting!

				KICKER
		Make it happen!

				JANESSA
		They're just subclass B droids.
		I'm so not impressed.

				BOEMAN
		Stoney, you catch.

	Stonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very 
	acrobatic move.

	Boeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step. He begins tossing his 
	friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall!

	Soon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left.

				BOEMAN
		We're clear! Let's go!

	Boeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety. 
	He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker.

	Kicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand. Boeman strains to pull him up as 
	spider's cover the floor below them, then -

	A spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's 
	thigh. He screams.

				KICKER
		They've got me! Let go!

				BOEMAN
		No!

	Boeman ROARS and pulls harder. Kicker's pack RIPS from his body - the 
	spiders falling with the pack.

	EXT. SURFACE - DAY

	The sand storm is raging on the surface. Kicker lands on top of Boeman.

				BOEMAN
		That wasn't so bad.

	Kicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole.

				KICKER
			(yells)
		This will be!

	The others dive for the ground as -  - 

	KAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole!

				THORGAN
		Nice touch.

				BOEMAN
		And you said high school was boring.

	Our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle.

	FAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers.

				FAT LOU
		Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .

				YLLO
		Just get us to the ship!

	Azrael stops in a panic!

				AZRAEL
		Oh shit I forgot my arm!

				ADRIENNE
		Here. Dumbass.

	She hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp.

	The door closed, the SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and soars into the 
	sky.

								CUT TO:

	EXT.  ORBIT AROUND OLD EARTH - LATE

	THE SHUTTLE maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit. Old 
	satellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Navigating through the debris, FAT LOU grabs a radio mike.

				FAT LOU
		This is Beowulf approaching from
		sector fifteen.

	Through the front windshield we see - - 

	GRENDEL, a class IV Catamaran Transport. It looks like two huge 
	torpedoes attached by three thin walkways. Not new, but by no means old.

				BERNIE(V.O.)
		I've got you, Beowulf. Proceed with docking.
		And by the way, Brodski's pissed.

	INT.  DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle doors open revealing SERGEANT BRODSKI and six E-X GRUNTS 
	standing with weapons at the ready.

	As the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two 
	stretchers, Brodski stepsi n front of YLLO.

				BRODSKI
		What the hell were you thinking?

	YLLO ignores him, turns to his team.

				YLLO
		Get them in the lab!

				BRODSKI
		Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.

	The E-X Grunts step in front of kids.

				YLLO
			(to the grunts)
		Back off!

				YLLO
			(back to the kids)
		Get them to the labs . . . Now!

	The team moves through the Grunts.

				YLLO
		What the hell are you doing?

	Brodski looks down at the stretcher with the young woman's body on it.

				BRODSKI
		My god! This is way over your head, pal.
		We need to call some experts and . . .

				YLLO
		I am an expert!

				BRODSKI
		You're a teacher.

				YLLO
		Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me.
		She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab,
		she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking
		head!

				BRODSKI
		What if they're carrying? Did you even check?

				KAY-EM 14
		Subjects scan virus clean . . .

	Brodski attempts to shove Kay-Em out of his way . . . BUT she stands her 
	ground . . . grabs his crotch.

				KAY-EM 14
		Mmm, you like the rough stuff don't you, big boy?

	Brodski and Yllo look at Thorgan.

				BRODSKI AND YLLO
		Thorgan!!

				THORGAN
		Sorry . . . I'll fix her . . . I promise.

				BRODSKI
		How do you know that piece of cursed rock down
		there doesn't carry something metal tits can't
		detect?

				YLLO
		Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.

				BRODSKI
		Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.

				YLLO
		I don't give a shit. This one's prime for
		decryonization. We're brining her back.

				BRODSKI
		I still think we should send for a team of
		real scientists.

				YLLO
		I am a scientist you asshole! This could be
		the most important discovery in 400 years. Do
		you have any idea what a find like this could
		mean?

				BRODSKI
		Right now, I care only for the safety of this
		crew. You don't know anything about these two -

	The stretcher with JASON moves by them. Brodski looks down.

				BRODSKI
		Jesus what the hell is that?

				YLLO
		That's exactly what we need to find out.
		Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you
		where discovery is concerned. Now step aside.
		I have a medical emergency to deal with.

	Reluctantly, Brodski steps aside. As the kids follow, Azrael bumps into 
	DALLAS, one of the E-X GRUNTS. Azrael glares at him, brandishing the 
	severed limb.

				AZRAEL
		Watch it punk, I'm armed.

				DALLAS
		Punk?

	Dallas slaps Azrael across the back of the head as he passes.

				AZRAEL
		You'll pay for that.

	Dallas and the grunts laugh.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

	FAT LOU and BERNIE, a synthetic pilot existing only from the waist up in 
	his pilot's chair, set course for home.

				BERNIE
		Gravitation nominal. Thrusters engaged.

				FAT LOU
			(into radio)
		Grendel to Grendel's mother, we are enroute.

				GRENDEL'S MOTHER(V.O.)
		Copy that, Grendel. Computer ovverides deployed.
		See you in two days.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LABS

	Dark, quiet, until the lights glare on.

	LAB ONE doubles as a Medical Research center and Sick Bay. GLASS JARS 
	filled with some of the strangest creatures ever seen cover the back 
	wall.

	Yllo and the students bring the girl in. Their movements are hurried and 
	economical . . .but they're excited.

				YLLO
		Get her prepped for the soup.
			(to Adrienne)
		Take the other one to lab two.

				ADRIENNE
		Yllo, this is my find. My project.
		I want to be in here.

				YLLO
		I know, dear, but this is too big a 
		discovery. I need you to prep the second
		body.

				ADRIENNE
		But, I want . . .

				YLLO
		This is a discovery that we will all share.
		We have to work as  a team. Now go. Stoney
		go with her.

	Thorgan and Delongpre lift the Girl onto the rejuvenation table.

	Stoney whispers something to Kkinsa before he exits with Adrienne.

	Kkkinsa nods and wheels a huge SCANNING MACHING over to the Girl. She 
	starts the scan as Delongpree and Thorgan cut the clothes off their 
	"find".

				THORGAN
		Have I told you guys how much I love this class?

	Delongpree brushes some of the melting crystals from her face.

				DELONGPREE
		She's beautiful . . .

	Thorgan cuts her shirt off.

				THORGAN
		Damn! Talk about your hard nipples.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne and Stoney push Jason into the lab.

	LAB TWO is smaller and less high-tech than LAB one. They shove JASON'S 
	body onto the EXAM TABLE. 

				ADRIENNE
		Fucking Yllo! Thinks he can push me aside.
		This is my find!

	She removes chucks of ice from JASON'S FACE.

				STONEY
		You know even though we both found this guy ,
		I'll let you take the credits. You can take it 
		from here.

				ADRIENNE
		Oh thanks . . . fine go. It's just another
		dissection. You'll only get in my way.

				STONEY
		Cool. Besides, you're into this shit.

	Stoney leaves Adrienne alone with Jason . . . and he is THAWING.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo walks around the room, overseeing all the action. He's excited and 
	cocky.

				YLLO
		Hands on training is rare. You should consider
		yourself lucky.

				AZRAEL
		Lucky?!

	Azrael sits in a large machine. This is . . .

	The NANO-TECH 2000. It can repair non-fatal injuries with the use of 
	Nano-Technology. 

	Azrael is scanned by the NT-2000 and so is his injury. It goes into 
	action as articulated mechanics begin to re-attach his arm.

				AZRAEL
		Another hour and I'd have lost
		the arm.

				JANESSA
		Oh, was that the hand you beat off with?

				AZRAEL
		I better get extra credit for this shit.

				YLLO
		Delongpree, Status. How you doing?

	Delongpree cuts her underpants from her body and tosses them over his 
	shoulder.

				DELONGPREE
			(swallows hard)
		I'm Okay.

				STONEY
		Well she's definitely a blond.

				JANESSA
		Oh that's scientific.

				DELONGPREE
		You think all girls from the past
		looked this good?

				JANESSA
		She's not that great.

				THORGAN
		400 years . . . I bet she'll be horny.

				YLLO
		Okay, people, we need to Learn everything
		there is to learn about our two guests. And
		if all goes well, I'll mention each one of
		you when I make my nobel prize speech.

				DELONGPREE
			(underbreath)
		Yeah, right.

	Delongpre presses a button on the table. The edges of the table RISE UP 
	to create a clear dome around the table. A hot gel-like substance shoots 
	out of small tubes. The FROZEN BODY is covered in the NANO-GEL.

	Thorgan checks a monitor.

				THORGAN
		Everything looks good.

	Yllo smiles - gushing self-satisfaction.

				YLLO
		Turn up the heat.

	Adrienne is wearing a metal eyepiece while staring at a computer screen. 
	No hands. 

				ADRIENNE
		Done. Crystallization remains
		seventeen percent.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne scans Jason with a machine identical to the one Kkinsa was 
	using in LAB ONE.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Crystallization at sixty percent
		Subject classification . . . deformity.

				ADRIENNE
		Put it on the screen.

	A monitor lights up with a scan of Jason's body. The internal organs are 
	distorted and bloated. She keys into the next lab. 

	Back to lab one.

				ADRIENNE(V.O.)
			(over speaker)
		Guys, check out beef-cakes scan.

	Jason's 3-D scan appears on one of the big monitors.

				ADRIENNE(V.O.)
		Look at the brain.

	Within Jason's skull is a brain the size of a golf-ball.

				JANESSA
		It's just like Thorgan's.
		What do you think this means?

	Thorgan grabs his crotch.

				THORGAN
		This is what it means right here.

				JANESSA
		Small brains make your balls itch?

				DELONGPRE
		And what's with the headgear?

				KAY-EM 14
		The mask is an artifact from a
		sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.

				BOEMAN
		Hockey.

				KAY-EM 14
		A medieval sport where two teams
		club one another with elongated
		sticks. Very sexy.

				YLLO
		What do you expect from a culture that
		sucked its planet dry of resources.

	She eyes Stoney. He smiles knowingly.

				KKINSA
		This bores me.

				DELONGPRE
		She's red. Body temp 98.6. This
		is so cool.

				YLLO
		Prep defib and start the cell 
		reconstruction.

	KAY-EM 14 presses a series of buttons. A long needle punctures the 
	GIRL'S NECK. Jason's scan is replaced by the girl's. We see 
	Nanotechnology going to work replacing her wounds and damaged cells.

				THORGAN
		Cool!

	Kkinsa and Stoney back out of the room unnoticed.

				YLLO
		Is she stable?

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject is stable and cell
		reconstruction has begun.

				DELONGPRE
		Now what?

				YLLO
		We wait. I need about fifteen.
		Call me if there are any changes.
		If she farts I want a full report.

				AZRAEL
		Don't I deserve a sick day or some
		shit like that?

	Yllo exits.
								CUT TO:

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	The door swishes open. Stoney enters with Kkinsa close behind. Kkinsa 
	raises her hand.

				KKINSA
		Adrienne?! Of all people!

				STONEY
		You're jealous.

	Stoney moves back. Kkinsa moves close hand raises above her head.

				KKINSA
		Adrienne?!

				STONEY
		It's over between us. You're the
		one I want.

	Kkinsa grabs the back of her shirt and pulls it over her head.

				KKINSA
		Bed!

	A bed slides out from the wall, hitting Stoney in the back of the legs, 
	causing him to fall on the bed. Kkinsa straddles him. Stoney grabs her. 
	The two fall into a feverish kiss.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne is prepping various medical tools. JASON'S BODY is laying on an 
	autopsy table. Steam rises from his body as thick ooze drips from his 
	thawing flesh.

	She turns on a computer monitor.

				ADRIENNE 
		Prepare organ vats.

	Two metal sinks hiss as liquid nitrogen flows.

				ADRIENNE
		Okay big boy . . . 

	She picks up a long, sharp chrome tool and walks over to Jason's body.

				ADRIENNE
			(continuing)
		. . . let's see what you're made of.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

	Yllo enters and approaches a computer console. The door behind him 
	opens. Janessa enters.

				JANESSA
		All this science shit, makes me horny.
			(removes her shirt)
		Take off your cloths, we don't have much
		time.

	She drops her shirt to the floor. Yllo retrieves it, hands it back.

				JANESSA
		You're quicker than usual.

				YLLO
		Later.

				JANESSA
		You prefer an apple?

	He forces her into the hall, closes the door, locks it. He returns to 
	the console.

				YLLO
			(to console)
		Secure line. Perez, Joshua,

	EXT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - EST.

	A huge cylindrical ship, floats quietly. We hear a BEEPING sound.

	INT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - PEREZ QUARTERS

	Joshua Perez rolls over, clicks on a light. He fumbles for a button, 
	presses it. A wall monitor lights up revealing Yllo's face.

	INTERCUT AS NEEDED

				PEREZ
		You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?

				YLLO
		We just left old Earth. You'll never believe
		what we found.

	Yllo inserts a disk into the console.

				YLLO
		I'm sending you the files.

				PEREZ

		Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels.
		See what kind of payday we're looking at.

		Alright, I'm . . .

		No way . . . is this a joke?

	Yllo smiles.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne leans over JASON'S THAWING body. Oozing goo drips from the 
	slab.

	She is inches away from his steaming mask. She taps it with her tool.

	She begins working at the straps of the mask, cutting the overgrown 
	flesh away.

	INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

	Yllo studies a monitor. On screen: a document entitled, EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS 
	OF DISCOVERY. He talks on the secure line.

				YLLO
		Hypothetically, how much are we talking?

				PEREZ(V.O.)
		If you're for real, you're looking at a million
		credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include
		touring and guest lectures. When can you get them
		here?

				YLLO
		I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?

				PEREZ(V.O.)
		See you then . . . doctor.

	Yllo's face glows with thoughts of fame and fortune.

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  HALL OUTSIDE YLLO'S QUARTERS

	Janessa has hooked up a small device to the door. She's heard every 
	word.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa rips off Stoney's shirt. Stoney grab her and rolls on top of her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	CLOSE ON JASON'S HAND - it curls, the frozen joints CRACKLE.

	Adrienne turns from Jason's mask. A large wad of goo hits the floor. She 
	turns back to her work. Slicing flesh away from the mask.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Stoney and Kkinsa kiss passionately as they wrestle to get each other's 
	pants off.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne tries to pry the Mask off . . . but it holds firm.

	She stick s a long sharp tool into an eye hole. We hear disgusting 
	noises as she probes JASON'S EYE SOCKET.

	She removes the tool, and on the end is Jason's eye!

	Holding it close she looks at it. It is bloated and distorted. She drops 
	it in a specimen jar and takes it over to her work station.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa rolls on top of Stoney. She holds his arms down as she whispers 
	in his ear.

				KKINSA
		How bad do you want it?

	Stoney gets his arms free and rolls on top of her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	JASON'S LEG JERKS!

	Adrienne turns again, then approaches.

				ADRIENNE
		Interesting. Record. Thawing has
		caused possible muscle spasms.

	She frowns at the disgusting ooze. A mixture of swamp waters, blood, and 
	other thawing bodily fluids, puddle around Jason's body.

	She moves back to her work station and picks up JASON'S BLOATED EYE. She 
	takes out an autopsy laser and cuts through the center of the eye.

	The laser slices through the fatty tissue as thick black goop drips out 
	of the eye. Adrienne stares into a microscope. This is all very 
	interesting.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Stoney lies on top of Kkinsa.

				KKINSA
		Yes . . . yes . . . that's it!

	. . . a moment, then both GASP as he enters her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	JASON sits up!

	CLOSE on ADRIENNE as she studies the dripping eye. She puts the laser 
	down and turns to the slab and freezes.

	JASON IS GONE!

	She spins around only to find Jason standing behind her. He grabs her by 
	the throat! She can't scream. She kicks wildly as he studies her.

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Delongpre, Boemen, Kay-Em 14 and Thorgan wait and watch girl in the 
	NANO-GEL. Thorgan is getting impatient. He can't find something.

				THORGAN
		Anybody seen the reticulator?

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne is thrown into a work light. The room goes dark. 

	INT.  LAB ONE

				DELONGPRE
		Try next door, there was one there
		yesterday.

	Thorgan exits.

	INT.  LAB TWO'S OBSERVATION ROOM

	The lights go. Thorgan looks around. Through the thick glass, where 
	JASON is killing Adrienne, is blackness.

				THORGAN
		Wakey wakey love birds . . . Yllo's
		gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling
		around instead of working.

	Thorgan roots through a drawer, his back to the glass.

	ANTE ROOM

	Through the glass beside him we see Adrienne screaming. But NO SOUND. 
	All rooms are air tight. Her head is smashed on the glass!

	Still screaming, her face recedes back into the darkness as Thorgan 
	looks over his shoulder.

				THORGAN
		Bye, lovebirds . . . Stoney, you dog.

	He exits.

	BACK TO JASON

	As he - -

	DUNKS Adrienne's head INTO ONE OF THE METAL SINKS. Her body goes limp. He 
	pulls her head up and stares at her frozen head, eyes open, mouth locked 
	in a scream.

	He thumps the head against a wall. IT SHATTERS! Jason drops the body 
	with a thud then turns to the - -

	DISSECTION TOOLS. He chooses a long silver cleaver.

	JASON'S BACK!

	EXT.  LAB ONE CORRIDOR

	Jason walks into the corridor from LAB TWO, steam still rising from his 
	cold body. He heads away from LAB ONE as soon as he's out of sight, YLLO 
	appears.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Delongpre wakes as Yllo enters.

				YLLO
		All right, lets do this. Thorgan
		begin the Defib program, Delongpre,
		ready the drainage units. Boerman get the
		others in here.

	Boeman grabs a wall mike.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa straddles Stoney.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		We've got a heartbeat!

	Her back arches in ecstasy.

				KKINSA
		No shit, we've got a heart beat!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Stoney, you copy? She's awake.
		You coming?

				STONEY
		Hell yeah I'm coming!

				KKINSA
		No . . . not yet!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Yes, right now!

				STONEY
		YES !!!

				KKINSA
		NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! YES!!!

				STONEY
		YES!!!!!!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Stoney, put your pants on and get
		your ass down here!

	They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door. Stoney hits the 
	door release and the door SWISHES open revealing - -

	JASON VOORHEES!

	Standing in the hall. He swings the silver cleaver.

	Stoney sidesteps as Kkinsa SCREAMS. Stoney SLAMS his palm into the door 
	panel. The door SWISHES to close but Jason's hand reaches out and stops 
	it.

	ENGINES WINE as JASON STRUGGLES to force the door open.

	Stoney keeps POUNDING the panel, trying to make the door close but 
	Jason's too strong!

	Jason grabs Stoney by the arm, jerks him into the doorway and releases 
	the door.

	The door closes! Splitting Stoney from forehead to crotch!

	Splashed with blood, Kkinsa falls to the floor cowering . . .
	mumbling nonsensically. 

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo, Janessa, Thorgan, Boemen and Delongpre anxiously huddle around the 
	Frozen Girl's body. Probes dangle in the gel.

				YLLO
		It's time.

				DELONGPRE
		What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?

				YLLO
		I've waited long enough.
		Kay . . . you know what to do.

	Kay presses buttons. We hear the whine of something powering up . . .

	Brodski enters the lab.

				YLLO
		What the hell are you doing?

				BRODSKI
		My job.

				YLLO
		Fine, just stay out of my way.
			(turns to Kay)
		Hit it. 

	An electrical noise flares THE SCREEN TO WHITE:

								SMASH CUT TO:

	INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

	OUR VIEW FROM A JERKY POV

	Running, freshly killed bodies at our feet. HEAVY BREATHING.

	Small fists beat against a door.

				GIRL'S VOICE
		Mom! Dad! It's loose! He's loose!

	The door swishes open revealing the dead bodies of a couple in their 
	forties.

	CLOSE ON THE GIRL

	We recognize her as the frozen girl. Her name, RIZZO (18), pretty.
	She screams. Turns.

	HER POV

	Standing at the end of the corridor, back lit and ominous is JASON 
	VOORHEES! He marches towards her.

	She runs. Snatches a headset from a wall mount.

				RIZZO
		Help me! Anyone! Somebody help me!

	STATIC from the radio. Jason closing.

	She reaches down and grabs a shot gun from a dead Security Guard. Chick-
	chick. KABLAM!

	Jason keeps coming.

	She runs.

	As she rounds a corner, we  see - -

	CRYOGENICS LAB

	She opens the door and enters the cold room. Slips on the wet frozen 
	ground, nearly falls.

	ON JASON as he rounds the corner, sees the open door.

	INT.   CRYO LAB

	Jason enters, his machete held ready. He stares at the Huge Cryo unit. 
	Door open. Otherwise the room is empty.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Hey!

	Jason turns. Rizzo is standing in the hall, the shotgun ready.

				RIZZO
		You son of a bitch!

	KABLAM! Jason slides backwards on the slick floor.

	KABLAM! Further, he nearly falls. 

	KABLAM! He stumbles, falls backwards into the cryo-unit.

	Rizzo slams her palm onto a console, the Cryo-unit door closes, JASON 
	INSIDE.

	RIZZO tosses the gun to the floor and types on a keypad.

	Steam HISSES, engines hum to life. The Cryo-Unit, Bucks violently.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Cryo-Unit activated.

	Slowly the unit goes silent, still. Rizzo stares at it, approaches 
	slowly, staring at the fogging glass -


	KA-CHING!

	The MACHETE BURSTS THROUGH THE GLASS, slicing into Rizzo's shoulder!

	ALARMS SOUND. The cryo lab's main door SLAMS shut.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Cryo-Unit leak. Lock down in progress.
		Security measures on line.

				RIZZO
		Nooooooo!

	She rushes toward the door. It won't budge.

				RIZZO
		Somebody! No!

	CHSHSHSHSHSH!

	Gas filters into the room from the leak in the Cryo-Unit.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Subject in computer unit has reached
		full incubation.

	Rizzo begins to fade. She stumbles.

				RIZZO
		No . . . 

	Cryo gas rolls along the floor . . .

	As blood pours from her wound, she reaches her bloody hand to the glass 
	window and draws -

	A SKULL AND CROSSBONES.

	-then passes out.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	RIZZO'S EYES pop open. She gasps for breath. Coughing and splitting the 
	Gel-like substance. She's sitting in a foot of gel, naked; Yllo, Brodski 
	and the kids around her.

				THORGAN
		That one did it!

	Yllo moves close to Rizzo.

				YLLO
		We should expect a moment of
		disorientation.

	WHAM! Rizzo punches Yllo in the nose.

				DELONGPRE
		Spunky . . .

				YLLO
		She broke my fucking nose!

				KAY-EM 14
		Again proving that your ancestors were savages.

				BRODSKI
		I like her already.

				KAY-EM 14
		Live signs full strength. Heart rate above normal - 

	Rizzo's disoriented, confused. Gel slops all around her.

				RIZZO
		Where..? Who . . .?
			(shock)
		I'm alive. You brought me back.

				YLLO
			(rubbing his nose)
		Obviously so.

	Rizzo looks down at her body, gel dripping off her naked flesh.

				RIZZO
		What the hell is this shit?

	Delongpre gives her a blanket. She covers herself.

				RIZZO
		How did I get here, how did you bring me back?

				YLLO
		Nanotechnology.

				RIZZO
		Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.

				YLLO
		We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.

				RIZZO
		30? How long was I out?

	Rizzo finally takes a good look at where she is. Something is very wrong 
	in her world.

				YLLO
		The year is 2455. You've been frozen
		for the past four hundred years.

	Rizzo gasps -- a shocking revelation.

				YLLO
		Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some 
		questions...

				RIZZO
		JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!

				THORGAN
		The hockey player? He a friend of yours?

				RIZZO
		Hockey player? He's not a ...

				THORGAN
		He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!

				RIZZO
		Old Earth?

				YLLO
		We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a
		few questions.

				RIZZO
		But...I...400 years?

				YLLO
		That's right, now if you could...

	Delongpre frowns at Yllo and moves to Rizzo.

				DELONGPRE
		It can wait. Let's get you cleaned up.

	Delongpre helps Rizzo off the table.

				YLLO
		Wait a minute...I need...

				BRODSKI
		Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.

				DELONGPRE
		Come on.

	INT.  LAB FOUR

	Rizzo stands at a small window looking out into space. Cleaned up she is 
	quite beautiful.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo?

	Rizzo is startled. She looks around.

				RIZZO
		Yeah?

	Delongpre comes through the door with a plate of food. 

				DELONGPRE
		I thought that after 400 hundred years,
		you just might have a little bit of an appetite.

	He puts the food on a small table and moves to the window.

				DELONGPRE
		You're on Grendel, a class IV Catamaran 
		transport.
		It's basically a school bus. We're on our way 
		back to Earth II.
		It's finals week.

	She turns back to the window.

				RIZZO
		You're telling me I'm a friggen class project?

	Delongpre flinches, expecting to be hit.

				DELONGPRE
			(a beat)
		Sort of. I mean, no, not really ...

	She collapses onto the bed.

				DELONGPRE
		I'll give you a moment alone. Do you
		want me to come get you when we start
		the dissection?

	Rizzo shrugs. She's lost everyone and everything. She's lot 400 years.

	Delongpre backs out of the room, closing the door behind him.

	Rizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes. She reaches into the pocket 
	of her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys. The key chain holds a 
	picture...a picture of her parents. She sits on the bed and starts to cry.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	As Delongpre enters all eyes turn to him.

				YLLO
		Well?

				DELONGPRE
		She needs a little time.

				YLLO
		More time...shit, she's had 400 years...

	Yllo laughs at his own joke.

				DELONGPRE
		That's really funny.

				YLLO
		I'd want her statements before we reach porch.
		Jesus, women.

				DELONGPRE
		Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything
		she went through?

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Dissection?

	Theyturn. Rizzo approaches Delongpre and Yllo.

				RIZZO
		Jason? He's on this ship?!

				YLLO
		Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in
		400 years...except for you, of course. Look if 
		you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking
		and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the
		publicity.

				RIZZO
			(glares)
		Are you finished?

	Yllo nods then --

	WHAM!

	Rizzo punches him again.

				YLLO
		God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!

				DELONGPRE
		Oh I like her a lot.

				BRODSKI
		I'm with you kid.

				RIZZO
		Where is he?

				BRODSKI
			(points)
		Lab two, relax. What's the matter?
		He's dead.

				RIZZO
		No, you're dead! You're all dead!

	She shoves Delongpre out of the way and out the door.

	INT.  LAB TWO - MOMENTS LATER

	The others enter to find Rizzo leaning over Adrienne's headless body.

				YLLO
		Jesus!

				JANESSA
		Oh my God! Adrienne?

				THORGAN
		What have you done?

				RIZZO
		What have I done?! Idiots.

	Thorgan throws up.

		BOEMAN
			(into a mike)
		Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an
		emergency!

				DELONGPRE
		Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?

				RIZZO
		I'll tell you where he is. He's walking
		around this ship, killing anything that
		moves.

				JANESSA
		Maybe she tripped.

	Brodski and Kicker burst into Lab Two, they react to the carnage.

				BRODSKI
		Jesus, God!

				KICKER
		Oh man, what the hell happened?

				RIZZO
		Jason! Can't you see? He did this.

				YLLO
		Impossible! He was dead before he entered
		Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could
		be alive.

				RIZZO
		I didn't say he was alive.

	INT.   GRID 52

	Azrael moves through a maze of walls and pipes. Stea, HISSES lights 
	STROBE. 

	He's dressed in full military garb, a huge gun strapped to his hsoulder.

	STALKING POV

	Something watching Azrael, his back to us. Azrael moves. The stalker
	closes in.

	Suddenly Azrael hits, rolls and comes up Blasting right at us.

	HIS POV

	A HUGE ALIEN CREATURE, fangs, claws and so on, leaps at him. THe big
	blaster hits home. The alien DISINTERGRATES.

	Sitting on the floor, Azrael sighs and wipes his brow.

	SUddenly, another alien rises up behind him with a hideos Screech. 
	There's nothing Azrael can do. He's a goner. Then --

	FZZT! A blast from elsewhere DISINTERGRATES THE CREATURE. MOVE TO 
	REVEAL--

	DALLAS, the grunt Azreael had words with earlier.

				DALLAS
		That's nine to four, geek-boy.

				AZRAEL
		You got lucky.

				DALLAS
		You got lucky. I could have waited until he
		ate your head.

				AZRAEL
		Speaking of which, duck!

	Dallas hits the deck as Azrael FIRES, disintegrating another. Beyond it 
	lunge a half dozen more.  Dallas and Azrael scramble to their feet,
	take aim, when --

	ONE OF THE ALIENS IS CUT IN HALF!

	GREEN GOO squirts from its body.

				AZRAEL
		What the?!

	JASON VOORHEES 

	SLASHES THROUGH another alien, splitting it down the middle.
	Then another.

				DALLAS
		He's good.

	Azrael smiles knowingly. He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason. 
	Aliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on. Dallas joins in
	unloading on the hulinking terror.

	THeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever.

				DALLAS
		That sucks. Why won't he go down?

				AZRAEL
		Pause play.

	Suddenly the aliens freeze in place. Jason stares at them, then turns to 
	Dallas and Azrael.

				DALLAS
		He's not part of the program.

				AZRAEL
		Hey cool. They brought ancient
		hockey guy back to life.

	Jason walks up to them. Titls his head like a dog hearing a high-pitched 
	whistle.

	Why aren't they running.

				AZRAEL
		Hey! We're playing a game here.
		Get off the court!

	Jason raises his silver blade high.

				DALLAS
		No, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts...

	SLASH! The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his 
	rib cage. Blood spurts
	as his right side pulls away from his body. Azrael does not seem hurt, 
	only pissed.

				AZRAEL
		Asshole that does not count as a kill.

				DALLAS
		Yes it does.

				AZRAEL
		Oh, come on!

	JASON is confused. He spins and slashed taking Dallas' head clean off. 
	The head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks.

				DALLAS
		Okay, enough of this shit.

				AZRAEL
		Alright, asshole.

	The sound of an ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN.

	Jason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court, all white, 
	sterile.

	No creatures, no Dallas or Azrael. A both ends of the white garganuan 
	room we see a small tinted glass.

	Azrael's voice booms over a loud speaker.

		Clear off the court, asshole.

	INT.  BOOTH ONE

	Azrael sits before a huge console wearing a virtual reality suit.

	Dallas is in his own suit from the opposite booth.

				DALLAS
		I don't have all day, kid.

				AZRAEL
		Yeah yeah I better call the labs,

	Jason stares at the tinted glass of Azrael's booth.

		Lab...this is AZ in the game grid.
		Your guy got out and runined our game.

	INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

				YLLO
		Azrael can you repeat that?

				RIZZO
		Get him out of there!

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		I said the guy in the mask is in here
		ruining our game.

	Jason starts to close in on Azrael's pod.

				AZRAEL
			(continuing)
		Send someone to the grid to pick
		him up. He looks lost.

				YLLO
		That's impossible.

				RIZZO
		I told you! Get them out of there!
			(grabs mike)
		Get out of there! Get out of there now!

			(into mike)
		All right fine, we'll head back--

	Suddenly, JASON shoves his fist through the glass.

				DALLAS
		Jesus!

	The sounds of Azrael's DEATH broadcast over the lab.

	When Jason retrieves his hand, he holds a bloody mass of Azrael's 
	insides.

	IN THE LAB, Brodski takes charge.

				BRODSKI
		Dallas! That you? Come back!

				DALLAS
			(into mike)
		Sarge! Get the fuck down here!
		We got a real shitstorm in the --

	DALLAS fights to get out of his virtual reality suit and get himself 
	into combat mode...BUT...

	JASON hears the movement. Turns, flings his silver blade.

	It flies across the room, throught the glass and impales Dallas' throat 
	to his chair.

	The blade shrots out the electronics in the grid and plunges the room to 
	black.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	As the connection goes to static.

				BRODSKI
			(into mike)
		Dallas?! Dallas?! Do you copy?

	Nothing. Finally...

				RIZZO
		He's dead. They're both dead. You
		don't understand what is on this ship.
		This is a being that kills. That's what
		he does. That's all he does. And he is very
		good at it.

				BRODSKI
		Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell
		me what the hell is going on!

	She gets up and heads for the door.

				DELONGPRE
		Where are you going?

				RIZZO
		We have to get off this ship.

	Yllo who has been losing control takes on the lead again.

				YLLO
		That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.

				RIZZO
		Why don't you get it? He's going to kill
		us all!

				BRODSKI
		I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever
		your ancient hockey player can throw at us.

				RIZZO
		Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship...
		and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the
		only way you're going to live.

				DELONGPRE
		You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future.
		We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of

		I hope so.

	EXT.  GAME GRID CORRIDOR

	Sven and Kicker approach the door. Casually, weapons slung low. The

				KICKER
		Damn. Are they playing?

		Dallas?! Azrael!

	Their combat sense perks up a bit. Something's not right. They turn on

	Kicker breaks off to inspect the other POD Sven tries to hold down his

	Brodski scans the room - a tactical assessment.

				BRODSKI
		This place should be safe. Get them

		around and kill one of your kids by accident.
		As much as I've dreamed of doing that.

	Brodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin.

				BRODSKI
		I need to know what you know about this guy.

				RIZZO
		Don't go out there. You can't win.
		We need to get off this ship. That's

		Not an option. I'm going to hunt this

	Rizzo shakes her head. She can't get through to this guy.

				BRODSKI
		I've been a grunt for fifteen years.
		There's not a problem I can't fix with
		enough ammunition.

	Yllo is getting no response.

				YLLO
		Stoney! Stoney if you can hear me,
		get your ass down to the lab immediately!
			(beat)
		I'm going to see if I can find them.

	Yllo opens the door and Kkinsa is there! Half-naked, covered in blood. 
	Janessa SCREAMS and the others gasp.

	Kkinsa falls to the floor..whimpering, in shock. Boeman rushes over
	to her with a blanket.

				KKINSA
		Sstoney's dead!

	They all look to each other, searching for what to say or do...Rizzo 
	puts her head in her hands...not again.

	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Brodski double-checks his sidearm as Yllo follows him down the hall.

				YLLO
		ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab,
		couple of hours no more. Let them take a
		look at our friends.

				BRODSKI
		Not a chance.

				YLLO
		JUst don't go in there half cocked.
		You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and
		ask questions later.

				BRODSKI
		You got that right.

	They arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM.

				YLLO
		This thing could be worth a great deal....
		scientifically...not to mention what the fat cats
		on Earth II would pay for it! Look, I'll split it with
		you 50/50...

	The door opens. The E-X Grunts are all there. Weapons in a rack on one 
	wall. They are in various states of battle dresss. Yllo follows Brodski in. 
	Brodski turns and faces him, his men behind.

				BRODSKI
		You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch!
		If that...that thing is out there, it's
		dead! You got it!!!

				KICKER
		Fuckin A...

				BRODSKI
		Now get out of our way...get back to the
		lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats...
		we've got a job to do!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo enters pissed off. The others are standing around not sure what to 
	do.

				YLLO
		That bastard! Boemen turn on the
		tracking monitors.

	Rizzo walks over to Kay-em 14. Thorgon is working on her.

				RIZZO
		Robot huh?

				KAY-EM 14
		Kay-em 14.

				RIZZO
		Barbie from hell...

				KAY-EM 14
		Cybernetics science droid,
		fluent in over six...

				RIZZO
		Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS,
		now how about you help me get
		out of this coffin, Barbie...

				KAY-EM 14
		I'm afraid I cannot assist.

	Rizzo is very frustrated.

				RIZZO
		I'm surrounded by idiots.

				KAY-EM 14
		You need to get laid!

	Thorgon looks up from his work.

				THORGON
		Sorry, I'm working on it.

				DELONGPRE
		Are all twenty-first century girls like you?

				RIZZO
		He'll kill us all. You know that, don't you?

	AN ALARM SOUNDS.

				THORGON
			(re:monitor)
		There's been an unauthorized entrance to the
		Cargo Bay.

				BRODSKI
		Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to
		Lab two and cover out backs.

				YLLO
			(into the mic)
		At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?

				BRODSKI (v.o.)
		I'll try.

								CUT TO:
	INT. CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

	kicker, sven, CONDOR, BRIGGS, and GEKO are locked and loaded. Dressed in 
	full armor,
	packing massive high tech weaponry, they are a sight to see. Jason may 
	have met his
	match.

				BRODSKI
		Alright, the teach requests we take this guy
		out at the knees. I say shoot to kill.

	The boys fidget with excitment. Bout time they see some action.

				BRODSKI
		So after you've killed him, put one in his knee
		so we can say we tried.

	The men LAUGH and high five.

				BRODSKI
		Go to infrared, stay in radio contact.
			(into headset)
		Teach you there?

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo walks in and sits at a bank of monitors. Through one, we see the 
	team standing at the cargo doors.

				YLLO
		Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		You just keep an eye out.

				YLLO
		Yeah yeah. Got it.

	Yllo removes his head set and quickly turns to a separate console. He 
	has his own agenda.

	INT.  CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

				BRODSKI
		Let's move out.

	The doors HISS open.

	INT. CARGO BAY

	A massive room. Boxes stacked hihg, some to the ceilin,g creating a 
	maze.

				BRODSKI
		Two teams, Port, starboard.

	They split up.

	INT. LAB ONE

	The kids are standing at a schematic of the ship. Several small blips 
	are entering the cargo area.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Kicker, anything?

				KICKER(V.O.)
		Negative.

	Rizzo stands over Thorgan to see the monitor.

				THORGAN
		Each blip represents a trained killer.
		It's men like that fought off the pirates
		on Earth II, battled Jauntuns on the solar 
		moons...

	For the moment, Rizzo looks distantly hopeful.

				RIZZO
		So, you're saying thse guys have like,
		lasers and stuff? They could hack him
		to pieces?

				THORGAN
		Exactly.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	Briggs and Geko move side by side. Condor brings up the rear. Suddenly 
	he is jerked out
	of view. 

	CLOSE ON CONDOR'S FACE, jason's hand around his throat. SNAP. The eyes 
	go dead, the neck broken.

	INT. LAB ONE

	Rizzo sees something. Her hopes fade.

				RIZZO
		WHAT'S IT MEAN WHEN ONE OF YOUR BLIPS 
	DISAPPEARS?

	All eyes turn to the schematic as one of the blips FLICKERS and FADES.

				KAY-EM 14
		E-x Grunt Condor has flatlined.

				BOEMAN
			(into mic)
		Sergeant, this is Boemen...

	INT.  CARGO BAY - STARBOARD

	Sergeant Brodski stops.

				BOEMAN(v.o.)
		You've lost Condor.

				BRODSKI
		Briggs, Geko, talk to me!

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	Briggs and Geko stare at each other.

				BRIGGS
		He was...he was right here!

	BACK TO BRODSKI

				BRODSKI
		DAMNIT to hell! We're coming to you!

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	A BLIP flashes for a second on the screen.

				THORGAN
		You see that?

				BOEMAN
		Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed
		fuselage.

	INT. CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

				BRIGGS
		Got it.

	BRIGGS and GEKO split up, moving around a large metallic tank.

	BRIGGS INFARED POV

	Gun ready, he moves around the crated fuselage slowly.

				BRIGGS
		I don't see anything.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	The blip flashes again.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		He's right there! In front of you!

	INFARRED POV reveal GEKO moving toward him.

				BRIGGS
		That's GEKO. mAYBE you kids should
		stay out of this.

	Briggs removes his gogles only to find Jason standing before him, 
	holding Geko's body...impaled
	onto his silver blade.

	BRIGGS fires...screams.

	INT.  LAB ONE

				BRIGGS(V.O.)
		He doesn't show up on...

	PAINFUL GURGLES then two more blips disappear.

				THORGAN
			(turns)
		Jesus, is this what it was like on your...

	Rizzo is cowering on the floor, her hands over her ears. She's sweating, 
	convulsing.

				BOEMAN
		Sergeant, you've lost two more men!

	INT. CARGO BAy - PORTSIDE

	Brodski and his remaining men double-time-it to the slaughter. Briggs 
	and Geko lie dEAD
	AT THEIR FEET.

				KICKER
		Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?

				BRODSKI
		Teach! Where the hell are you?!
		Where's our visuals?!!

	INT. LAB TWO

	Yllo is talking on  aseparate mike. Unwaakre of the slaughteri n the 
	next room.

				YLLO
		Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the
		Solaras Space Lab.

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.

				YLLO
		We've got a situation here! Just do
		as  you're told!

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon
		as we've passed Tara's rings we'll
		make the course correction.

	BACK TO YLLO.

				YLLO
		Thank you.

	Yllo disconnects, and turns to the other console.

				YLLO
			(into mic)
		Ok Sarge, what's your status?

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three
		men and your worthless fuck! After I 
		kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!

				YLLO
		But I didn't see...

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	GUNFIRE ERUPTS!

				SVEN(V.O.)
		I got him! I got him!

	INT. LAB ONE

	CHEERS from everyone except Rizzo who knows better. She shakes her head.

				THORGAN
		Yes!

				RIZZO
		Listen up duck fuckers, you can't
		kill this thing.

				BOEMAN
		Duck fuckers?

				RIZZO
		He's either unconcious or playing dead,
		whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay,
		you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.

				DELONGPRE
		Outta here?

				RIZZO
		Isn't there an escape POD on this ship?
		Something?

				THORGON
		There's a shuttle.

				RIZZO
		Alright, been nice knowing you.
		Who's with me?

				KKINSA
		I'll go.

				BOEMEN
		Yllo said stay here.

				KKINSA
		Fuck Yllo!

				BOEMEN
		They got him! You're not leaving!

	INT. CARGO BAY - MIDSHIP

	Sven is kneeling over Jason's body. 

				SVEN
		Big sucker too.

	Suddenly, Jason reaches up, grabs the back of Sven's head and SLAMS it 
	into his mask.
	Sven's forehead shatters.

	ON BRODSKI

	As he races around a crate. Sven's body is within sight. His killer 
	nowhere to be seen.

				BRODSKI
		Kicker? Where are you?

	Elsewhere we hear GUNFIRE followed closely by a SCREAM!

	ELSEWHERE

	Kicker crawls across the floor, blood spews from his mouth.

	PULL BACK TO RVEAL

	He's been split in half at the wait...his entrails dragging behind him..
	SHUNK! A machete throught the back of the neck puts him out of his 
	misery.

	INT. LAB ONE

				RIZZO
		Do something!!!

				THORGON
		Don't look at me! I'm in high school!

	INT. CARGO BAY

	Brodski runs. He's spooked. Twisting and turning in every direction.

				BRODSKI
		Find Crutch! Set up an ion field
		around the cargo bay. We'll torch
		the sucker! Yllo...you're a dead man!

	Brodski races toward the Cargo exit.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	ON MONITOR

	We see Brodski racing towards us. We also see Jason, lying in wait, 
	hidden by one 
	of the crates.

				YLLO
		Sergeant!

				BRODSKI
			(stops)
		What?

	Yllo considers then.
				YLLO
		Nothing.

	On the monitor we see Brodski move forward. He never saw Jason coming.
	BRODSKI SCREAMS.  Yllo turns his head.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	The kids stand in shock, silently staring at one another, listening to 
	the
	static of the dead communications. Boeman reaches over and clicks off 
	the radio.
	Silence.  Rizzo leaps to her feet.

				RIZZO
		Lesson number one, kiddies. You wanna
		get home safely then we get off this boat.

	Kkinsa starts t cry.

				KKINSA
		I don't understand...what does he want?

				RIZZO
		He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone
		on this ship.

	Rizzo looks at everyone.

				RIZZO
		Any questions?

	A side door HISSES OPEN. Yllo enters.

				YLLO
		You're not going anywhere.

				RIZZO
		You wanna die?

				YLLO
			(ignores her)
		Are we locked down?

				BOEMAN
		That door's the only way in or out and it
		won't open without the code.

				YLLO
		Then we wait. We're docking with Space Lab
		in less than an hour.

				RIZZO
		What good will that do?

				YLLO
		They can deal with this sort of thing.

				RIZZO
		More soldiers?

				YLLO
		Scientists. Very intellegent men.

				RIZZO
		That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's
		ass at a spelling bee!

				JANESSA
		Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out
		and let us handle this?

				YLLO
		Try to calm down. Just think, you're going
		to be famous!

				RIZZO
			(to kids)
		Guys, please come with me!

				YLLO
		4You're not going anywhere.

	Rizzo starts for the door but Yllo grabs her arms, holds them behind 
	her.

				DELONGPRE
		Now hold on! We should hear her out!

				THORGAN
		She's obviously dealt with this guy before.

				YLLO
		Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!

				DELONGPRE
		No shit. I got no problem with that.

	Janessa readies a hypo.

				THORGAN
		Maybe if we knew a little bit more about
		what we're delaing with here...

	Janessa moves behind Rizzo with the sedative.  Suddenly Rizzo throws her 
	head back, Salmming it into Yllo's nose. He CRIES OUT in pain.

	Janessa lunges with the syringe but Rizzo snatches her wrist, grabbing 
	the hypo, burying it into Janessa's left breast.

				RIZZO
		tNighty-night.

	Janessa collapses.  Yllo rushes Rizzo again, but this time Boeman 
	stands, blocks his path.

				CRUTCH
		Leave her be.

				RIZZO
		Ok, who do I gotta fuck to get off this boat?

	Thorgan timidly raises his hand.

				RIZZO
		Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship.
		Come with me.

				THORGAN
		Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space?
		We'll die oout there.

	Rizzo rushes the door. There's a code box on the wall.

				RIZZO
		How do you open the damn door?

				YLLO
		You're crazy!

	Kkinsa punches in the code. The door HISSES open.

				DELONGPRE
		Rizzo, he's out there.

				RIZZO
		Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.
			(looks at Delongpre)
		Last chance.

	The others stare at her. She's crazy.

				RIZZO
		Fine. Bye.

	She and Kkinsa exit, the door SWISHES CLOSED behind them.

				YLLO
			(favoring his nose)
		Pack your shit. We'll disembark in an hour.
		The guys at Space Lab have the necessary
		equipment to contain this thing and then we
		can study it.

	But the kids aren't so sure.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Yllo enters, makes sure he wasn't followed then approaches a console.

				YLLO
		Computer on line.

	A series of beeps.

				JANESSA(O.S.)
		What are you doing?

				YLLO
			(jumps)
		Jesus! Can't you knock?
			(back to console)
		Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Power to Beowulf disengaged.

				YLLO
			(to Janessa)
		She's too valuable. She's not leaving this ship.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GRENDEL BRIDGE

	Fat Lou and Bernie prepare for course corrections.

				FAT LOU
		Disengage auto-pilot.

				BERNIE
		Disengaged.

				FAT LOU
		New COURSE, seven-eighty-one.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	She banks slowly to the right.

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				BERNIE
		On course. ETA 36 minutes, 34 seconds.

				FAT LOU
		Engage auto pilot.

	Suddenly, Bernie is ripped from his chair! Electricity SHOOTS through  
	the console
	as Bernie's DIALOG becomes jibberish.

				BERNIE
		En-en-en-en...Eta-Eta...

	Fat Lou stares up in shock just before JASON SLAMS Bernie's torso ontop 
	of her.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	FAT LOU'S upper body has disappeared. In other words, Bernie now has 
	legs.
	Little good they'll do him.

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD.

	Far in the distance we see a tiny space station -- SPACE LAB.
	A monitor reads ...

	SPACE LAB ETA 00:35:59 and counting.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Rizzon and Kkinsa enter.

				RIZZO
		Which way?

	Kkinsa points. They head in that direction. Then Rizzo suddenly stops.

				KKINSA
		What?

				RIZZO
		Ssh.

	Rizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates.

				RIZZO
		He's in here.

	Kkinsa opens her mouth to scream. Rizzo slaps her hand over Kkinsa's 
	mouth.

				RIZZO
		You scream I'll snap your neck.
		Got it?

	Kkinsa nods. Rizzo releases her.

				KKINSA
			(whispers)
		How do you know?

				RIZZO
			(dread)
		I just know.

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	The crew has packed their essentials and now wait to dock with Space 
	Lab. Yll is standing
	before the others holding Jason's machete.

				YLLO
		We must assume the machete was an
		intricate part of the game of hockey.

				DELONGPRE
		I'm thinking Rizzo was right.

				YLLO
		Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?

				DELONGPRE
		Maybe we should go with them. Like you said,
		your Space Lab connections can deal with this 
	thing.
		At least we'll be safe.

				YLLO
		They are not going anywhere. I cut power to
		the  shuttle.

	The kids and Crutch stare at him. Cold hearted.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Rizzo and Kkinsa approach. 

				RIZZO
		Open the doors.

	Kkinsa punches in a series of buttons. Nothing.

				KKINSA
		Something's wrong.

				RIZZO
		Keep trying!

	INT.  LAB ONE

				YLLO
		Everyone ready?

	Yllo grabs a mike from a console.

				YLLO
		Fat Lou, what's the ETA?

	STATIC.

				YLLO
		Lou, goddamjnit! Bernie, where's Lou?!

	STATIC.

	Boeman moves to one of the consoles, clicks a few buttons.

	ON MONITOR

	We see the view from the bridge security camera. Lots of blood and the 
	mangled combination of Lou and Bernie.

				THORGAN
		Yuck.

				DELONGPRE
		We're screwed.

				YLLO
		The ship doesn't need pilots to dock.
		We'll disembark and you'll see.
		Everything will be fine.

				BOEMAN
		Uh...that's gonna be a problem.
		The ship's not on auto-pilot.
		We're flying blind.
			(a beat)
		Thirty minutes till impact.

	All eyes turn to Yllo, for guidance, his back to the outer door.

				YLLO
		I guess...we'll have to go to the bridge.

				THORGAN
		But...

	Jason is out there. Then --

	WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

	The outer door bucks and dents! Everyone jumps!

	WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

								QUICK-CUT TO:

	INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Over the headsets, Rizzo and Kkinsa hear the SCREAMS.

				RIZZO
		Damnit, he's got them.

	Kkinsa keeps trying the code box. Nothing.

				KKINSA
		Rizzo, I think Yllo must have done
		something. The door won't open.

	INT.  LAB ONE

				YLLO
		It's alright. He can't get in here!

	WHAM! WHAM!!! But the door is starting to give.

	Through the confusion, Crutch moves to one of the consoles. Clicks
	away at the keyboard.

	INT.   SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle hums to life.

				KKINSA
		The power's back up!

				RIZZO
		Then open the doors!

				KKINSA
		Thirty seconds.

	INT.   LAB ONE

	WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!

				JANESSA
		What do we do?!!

				YLLO
		Crutch?

				CRUTCH
		Help me up.

	Boeman helps Crutch to the top of a table. Crutch goes to work on a  
	ceiling
	vent, removing screws.

				JANESSA
		Okay, I'm guessing you should hurry.

	The top corner of the door bends...Jason peers through.

				THORGAN
		Jesus, tell this asshole I don't
		play hockey!

				CRUTCH
		Okay!

	Our group starts climbing the table and into the ceiling space.

				YLLO
		Will that take us to the bridge?

				CRUTCH
		It's a maze up there, but yes.

				YLLO
		We'll engage auto-pilot!
		Everything'll be fine!

	With that, the door gives!

	Boeman heaves Crutch into the crawl space then follows himself.  Jason 
	pauses,
	staring at Kay-Em --

				KAY-EM 14
		Heart beat irregular...no blood flow...
		impossible...this....this... does not
		make sense.

	Jason's heard enough. He swings his cleaver, but Kay-Em ducks. Turns and 
	leaps
	through the hole in the celing.

	INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

	Yllo grips the ledge.

				YLLO
		Move it people!

	Then Yllo screams. Jason has him from below. Boeman grabs his arms.

				BOEMAN
		Help me!

	DeLongpre grabs hold and pulls. Suddenly Yllo is jerked out of their
	grasp. They fall onto their backs breathing heavily.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo leaps to his feet. Jason looms over him.

				YLLO
		Now hold on! Have you considered
		how valuable you are? Credit, fame,
		you can have it all. And ladies. I 
		mean, how long has it been?

	Jason stands there, but his attention isn't on Yllo. It's on the machete 
	sticking through
	Yllo's belt. Jason reaches for it. Yllo backs into a wall.

	Jason slowly removes the machete from Yllo's belt and stares at it. He 
	drops
	the cleaver to the ground.

				YLLO
			(chuckles)
		That's all you wanted?

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle doors slide open as we hear over the headset --

				YLLO(V.O.)
		It's okay, he just wanted his machete.

				RIZZO
			(knowingly)
		Three...two...one...

	Yllo screams.

	INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

	Yllo's SCREAMS turn to GURGLES. All eyes stare at the opening in the 
	walkway, then --

	YLLO'S HEAD LANDS IN BOEMAN'S LAP!

				KAY-EM 14
		Now that's just gross.

	JASON STICKS HIS HEAD THROUGH.  EVERYONE JUMPS, SCREAMS.

				DELONGPRE
		GO, GO, GO!

	They race down the walkway, over huge pipes and through electrical 
	wires, Crutch 
	in the lead.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Kkinsa enters the shuttle, turns to Rizzo.

				KKINSA
		Rizzo, come on!

	But, Rizzo hesitates. We can still hear the PANICKED SCREAMS over the 
	headset.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Go-go-go-go-go!!!!

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		He's right behind us!

				RIZZO
		Damn!
			(to Kkinsa)
		Close the door! I'll be right back.

				KKINSA
			(panicked)
		What?!!

				RIZZO
		I gotta go back.

				KKINSA
		But?!!

	Rizzo turns and races through the maze of boxes and crates leaving 
	Kkinsa nearly
	insane.

	INT.  CELING WALK SPACE

				KAY-EM 14
		I'm quite sure I wasn't designed for this.

	Crutch comes to a fork in the walkway.

				CRUTCH
		Okay, we need to ...

				BOEMAN
		You forgot didn't you, you old
		fart?

	At the back of the line, Delongpre turns as Jason rounds the bend behind 
	him.

				DELONGPRE
		Shit! Move it! He's coming!

	Delongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan

				DELONGPRE
		Go!

	Racing forward the group stays just out of Jason's grasp. Leaping
	over and under and through whatever blocks the path.

				DELONGPRE
		Faster!

	Jason swings his machete at DeLongpre! It just misses him.

				DELONGPRE
		FASTER!!!

	Crutch comes to ascreened panel. Boeman kicks it open.
	They leap down onto a catwalk crossing the --

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	They are twenty feet off the ground as --

	Rizzo stops, stares straight up.

	HER POV

	the group races across the catwalk as Json leaps down behind them.

				DELONGPRE
		He's right on my ass!

	Then Jason grabs Delongpre, who screams.

	RIZZO,

	spots a gun left by one of the marines. She snatches it, points it 
	towards
	Jason and Delongpre then aims a little high.

	FZZZT!

	It slices through a metal cord holding the catwalk to the ceiling.

	The catwalk jerks. Everyone tumbles. Jason loses his grip on Delongpre.

	Suddenly, METAL SCREECHES, as the catwalk gives under the weight. It 
	RIPS in half,dumping both
	heroes and Jason.

	RIZZO dives out of the way as a pile of metal and bodies crash to the 
	ground!

	Janessa sits up rubbing her head.

				JANESSA
		That was fun.

	Kay-Em 14 sits up, sings.

				KAY-EM 14
		I got a brand new pair of
		roller-skates, you got a brand new key...

				JANESSA
		Thorgan?!

				THORGAN
		I didn't do it. The fall scattered her
		programming..wait. Where's? Shit!

	He's lying on top of Jason. He scrambles to his feet. But Jason doesn't 
	move.

				THORGAN
		Hey, I think the fall killed him.

	The group slowly gathers around. Jason sits up and swings at Thorgan. 
	Boeman pulls him out of
	the way just in time.

	Jason starts to stand when RIZZO comes up behind him.

	KA-FWAM! She brings the barrel of a high tech gun down on the top of 
	Jason's head.
	He collapses. The surrounded faces look happily suprised.

				RIZZO
		Trust me, it's temporary.

	Boeman takes the gun from Rizzo.

				BOEMAN
		Better let me.

				THORGAN
		Where'd you get the gun?

	Rizzo gestures at what's left of Geko's body.

				CRUTCH
		The bridge is this way!

	They take off running.

				RIZZO
		Wait!

	Everyone stops, turns --

				KAY-EM 14
		There's not enough time.

	Rizzo catches up.

				RIZZO
		Forget the bridge, the shuttle's
		waiting!

				BOEMAN
			(to Kay-Em)
		What do you mean, not enough time?

				KAY-EM 14
			(switches voice)
		You know what you get if you shove
		two bananas up your ass? Two shit covered
		bananas.

				JANESSA
		I think your metal lover's losing it.

				KAY-EM 14
			(normal voice)
		Impact in ten minutes. It will take 
		fifteen to reach the bridge.
			(switches voices, sings)
		Mamma's little baby love shortnin,
		shortnin, mamma's little baby love 
		shotnin bread...

				DELONGPRE
		Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.

				RIZZO
		Guys!!! The shuttle?

	The kids look at one another as if this were a stroke of genius.

				RIZZO
		Idiots.

				CRUTCH
		This way!

	Crutch again leads them through the maze. Delongpre stops at
	another Grunt body, removes a chain gun. THorgan takes a high
	tech laser from another.

				THORGAN
		I feel better. Now how do you
		fire this damn thing?

				DELONGPRE
		Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!

				CRUTCH
			(jokingly)
		Just around this bend...

	Jason steps out in front of Crutch, his machete held poised in front of 
	him.
	Crutch runs right up onto the blade.

				BOEMAN
		Nooooo!

	Alrhoguh he's meat on a stick, Crutch doesn't give up. He SLAMS his 
	fists into
	Jason's torso.

	Thorgan turns to fire --Boeman KNOCKS the barrel high.

				BOEMAN
		You'll hit crutch!

	Boeman tosses his weapon to Janessa and leaps on Jason's back, locking 
	his arms 
	around his neck.

				RIZZO
		What are you doing? You can't save him!

	Delongpre smashes the back of Jason's knee with the chaingun.
	Jason topples on top of Boeman. Crutch is thrown free.

	Janessa and Thorgan help Crutch to his feet as Jason sees Rizzo for the
	first time in 400 hundred years.

	It's either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge. He leaps to his
	feet and races towards her.

				RIZZO
		Don't just stand there! Shoot him!

				DELONGPRE
			(to Jason)
		No you don't!

	BRAAAAAAATTTT!

	The chaingun dances Jason backwards. He CRASHES through the side of one 
	of the 
	cargo boxes. EVERYONE STOPS.

				RIZZO
		Don't stop!

	She jerks the gun from Delongpre and races to the crate.

				RIZZO
		You never stop when he's down!

	But the crate is empty.

				RIZZO
		Shit!!!!

	They spin around, searching.

				CRUTCH
			(weak)
		Forget him. Come on.

	Carrying Crutch, they move toward the shuttle bay.

	INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	panel, clicks some buttons, then --

				BOEMAN
		Uh-oh.

				JANESSA
		What?!

				BOEMAN
		Kkinsa! Open the doors!

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT


	Kkinsa sits in the pilot's seat. She's terrified.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Kkinsa! He's coming! Open the doors!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	DeLongpre shoves Boeman out of the way.

				DELONGPRE
		Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!

				RIZZO
		Yeah, that's it, scare the hell
		out of here, that'll work.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(calming)
		Kkinsa, it's me, Rizzo. He's not
		out here right now, so please let us in.

	Kkinsa doesn't move.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to
		the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

				DELONGPRE
		Med-kit?

				RIZZO
		I guessed.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kkinsa considers. She reaches for a button marked SHUTTLE 
	DOORS...hesitates.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		We're going to be okay, Kkinsa.
		Just relax.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Kay-Em 14 steps forward.

				KAY-EM 14
		Allow me. I'm trained in all aspects
		of the human psyche.

	Rizzo backs away -- as Kay-Em nears the mike ...

				KAY-EM 14
		Kkinsa, dear, it is I, KAY-EM 14...
		open the fucking door you silly bitch!

	Rizzo shoves Kay-Em out of the way.

				KAY-EM 14
		I didn't say I was good at it.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Oh shit! There he is!

	INT.  CARGO BAY SHUTTLE

	Jason is standing at the entrance to the Cargo Shuttle Bay.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kkinsa leans forward and presses --

	LAUNCH.

	INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	The Shuttle ROARS to life and begins pulling away from the ship.

				BOEMAN
		Kkinsa! No!!!

	EXT.   GRENDEL CLASS IV

	The shuttle moves slowly away from the docking position.

	INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	Rizzo opens fire! Thorgan and Delongpre join in.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As boxes and cargo shatter under the heaby fire. Smoke rises. It's 
	impossible
	to see where Jason is. RIZZO stops FIRING.

				RIZZO
		DON'T WASTE YOUR AMMO!

	But, they don't let up. Boxes explode, crates collapse until -- 
	Thorgan's gun clicks empty.
	Then Delongpre's.

	SILENCE.

	The smoke slowly clears revealing the rubble.

				THORGAN
		Did we get him?

	Suddenly, Jason again steps into the Cargo entrance.

				DELONGPRE
		We're screwed!

				RIZZO
		400 years in the future and these
		pea-shooters are the best you can do?!

	They are trapped. Jason blocks the only exit. He slowly moves towards 
	them.

				RIZZO
		Just make a break for the door.
		He'll get some of us, but that's the
		breaks.

				BOEMAN
		We're not leaving Crutch!

				RIZZO
		We don't have time to argue!

	But Jason has locked in on Rizzo. He moves towards her.

				JANESSA
		Okay, tell you what. You die, we'll run.

	Rizzo and the others back into a corner. Jason has them. There's nothing 
	they
	can do.

	Rizzo holds the gun steady, waiting for point blank range. 

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	SPACE LAB, which was only a dot the last time we saw it, suddenly looms 
	toward us.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Collision eminent.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	The left side of Grendel SMASHES into the side of Space Lab!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	Suddenly everything shifts toward the bridge. Boxes, cargo, kids, and 
	Jason!

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	Grendel SLIDES along SPACE LAB, ripping huge chunks of metal from both.
	SPARK fly. There are interior EXPLOSIONS on Space Lab, then --

	KA-FOOM!

	Space Lab EXPLODES!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	The entire ship shifts upwards. Cargo, crew, and Jason fly into the air.

	ELECTRICAL fires sprout up all over. Cargo boxes SHATTER, contents 
	SPILLING.

	RIZZO loses her gun.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	Debris from Space Lab TEARS into the side of the ship and beyond.

	EXT.  SHUTTLE

	One huge chunk heads right towards the Shuttle.

	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Kkinsa stares out the window as the huge chunk flies toward her.

	EXT.  SHUTTLE 

	IMPACT! THE SHUTTLE IMPLODES! ONE BRIGHT RED FIREBALL.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Everything piled and in tatters. Our heroes slowly regain their 
	bearings.

				BOEMAN
		Everyone okay?

				THORGAN
		I think I broke my arm.

				KAY-EM 14
		I seem to have misplaced mine.

	Kay-Em 14's right arm is missing, wires sticking out of the stump.

				JANESSA
		You geeks wanna gimmie a hand?

	Janessa is buried beneath a pile of rubble. Boeman helps her to her 
	feet.

				DELONGPRE
			(quiet)
		We lost crutch.

	Rizzo stands and watches as the other sgather around Crutch's body.
	It's battered and twisted all out of place. Boeman falls next to the 
	body.

				BOEMAN
		Goodbye old friend.

				RIZZO
		Okay, he was a great guy, now
		let's move out.

				BOEMAN
			(snaps)
		Could you show a little compassion?!

	Rizzo stares at Boeman.

				RIZZO
		Look, I'm sorry. I really am, but aren't you
		forgetting about ...

	SUDDENLY a pile of rubble EXPLODES.

	Jason rises, his back to them.

				DELONGPRE
		Back to the labs!

	But Jason has other plans. Seemingly unfazed by the past events he 
	rushes after them.

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Dam-damage port side 59 percent.
		Decompression 40 percent. Gravity-y rotors
		failing.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Our kids race toward the door, Jason right behind them --

	Thorgan slams the door panel with his good arm. SPARKS fly.
	The door won't open.

				THORGAN
		Oh shit.

	They turn as Jason looms toward them, then --

	EVERYTHING STARTS TO FLOAT

	Cargo and debris. Our heroes. Jason.

	The loss of gravity and Jason's steamrollering momentum SLAMS him into 
	the 
	cargo doors, BREAKING them open and sending him tumbling backwards.

				JANESSA
		This is just great.

				KAY-EM 14
		Engage magnetics.

	Kay-Em 14's left hand magnetically locks to the Cargo frame a

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason grabs Rizzo's ankle. Boeman, floating close, punches Jason in the 
	back of the head.

	Still holding Rizzo's ankle, Jason topples, spinning the two out of 
	frame.

	The force of the punch sends Boeman in the opposite direction.

				THORGAN
		This is crazy, we can't do anything like this!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo KICKS Jason in the top of the head, sending him SLAMMING into the 
	ceiling.

	A SEVERED ARM

	floats past DeLongpre. There's a chain gun still clutched by the  hand.
	Delongpre grabs both and turns the gun on Jason.

	BRAAATTTT...

	Jason is sent further back, but the force of the chaingun SLAMS 
	Delongpre into a back wall.
	He's knocked unconcious.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Thorgan manages to grab Kay-Em 14 around the neck.

				THORGAN
		Grab my hand!

	Janessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious 
	dELONGPRE'S FOOT.

				JANESSA
		Boeman, can you reach DeLongpre?
		We'll push you in.

	CARGO - MIDSHIP

	Jason is floating toward the other end of the Cargo Bay,
	unable to stop himself.

	BOEMAN

	reaches for DeLongpre. Inches away. Finally he grabs Delongpre by the 
	locks of his
	hair, pulls himself closer.

				DELONGPRE
		Hey! That hurts.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling. She manages to grab hold of a 
	hanging piece of
	busted catwalk.

				DELONGPRE
			(to Rizzo)
		Push off toward us.

				JANESSA
		Forget her, she's a pain in the ass.
		Let her hang there.

	Crutch's body floats into our heroes, his intestines spilling from his 
	open gut,
	tangling around our heroes.

				THORGAN
		I'm gonna spew.

				JANESSA
		That ought'a help the situation.

				DELONGPRE
		Do it Rizzo! We'll catch you.

	RIZZO'S POV

	Rizzo stares at the human rope that consists of Thorgan, Janessa, 
	Boeman, and Delongpre.

				RIZZO
		What if you miss?

				DELONGPRE
		What if we don't?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	AS JASON steadies himself against a wall, focuses in one Rizzo, then 
	pushes off with his feet.

	HE ROCKETS toward her!

				DELONGPRE
		He's coming right at you!

	Rizzo spots Jason and pushes off! But her aim was HURRIED...
	and bad. She's gonna miss them.

	Boeman flips in the air!

				BOEMAN
			(to Delongpre)
		Grab my feet!

	Delongpre does and Boeman reaches out and snags Rizzo. The momentum 
	spins the human
	chain into a near wall --KAFWAM-- nearly breaking it apart.

				JANESSA
		Okay that hurt.

				BOEMAN
		Thorgan, pull us in.

	Jason SLAMS into the ceiling, then careens off of the wall --

	As Thorgan pulls the group out of the Cargo bay.

				THORGAN
		What now?

	They watch as Jason grabs a hold of the walkway.

				JANESSA
		Shit. He's gonna send himself right at us.

	Jason takes aim.

								QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				COMPUTER VOICE
		System repair activated. Back up power on line.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Jason again ROCKETS THROUGH THE AIR -- when

	GRAVITY IS RESTORED.

	He drops to the cargo floor like a rock! Falling cargo -- huge crates, 
	gargantuan machines,
	a forklift -- buries him.

	Our heroes tumble to the ground.

				JANESSA
			(to Rizzo)
		Get off of me!

	They stand slowly, eyeing the rubble.

				THORGAN
			(rubbing his arm)
		You think it killed . . .
			(off Rizzo's stare)
		Yeah, I guess not.

				JANESSA
		Let's just get out of here.

				BOEMAN
		The ship's in bad shape. Back to
		the labs. Let's check out status.

	INT. SHIP CORRIDORS

	Our group makes their way back toward the labs.

	ELECTRICAL fires are everywhere. Systems are shorting out all over the 
	ship.

	INT. LAB ONE

	Rizzo, in the lead, enters the lab, when the ship BUCKS and QUAKES! A 
	portion of the hall
	collapses behind her.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Boeman and the others dive back out of the way.

				BOEMAN
		Shit!

				THORGAN
		The hull's imploding!

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo! Can you hear me?!

	INT.  LAB ONE

				RIZZO
		Yeah. Are you guys okay?

	Boeman peers through a crack in the collapsed hull.

				BOEMAN
		There's a red lever on the wall
		beside you. Pull it!

	Rizzo turns, spots the red lever. EMERGENCY PRESSURIZATION STABILIZER.
	It's bolted.

				RIZZO
		It's locked!

				BOEMAN
		Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's
		going to depressurize!

	Rizzo kicsk the metal leg from a table. BASHES the bolt with it, until 
	it breaks.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry Rizzo! You have to reverse
		the pressurization.

	She grabs the lever...then hesitates. Backs away.

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing?!!

				RIZZO
		If the ship goes, so does Jaso.

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo pull the fucking lever!

				RIZZO
		No.

				DELONGPRE
		Rizzo?!

				RIZZO
		It's better this way. If we were rescued
		Jason would just get off the ship. You want
		him on your precious Earth II?

	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Boeman and the other start tearing the debris out of the way!

				THORGAN
		Hurry! She's lost it!

				JANESSA
		So what else is new?

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Boeman climbs through a hole in the rubble. He grabs the lever.

				RIZZO
		Boeman don't. You know I'm right.

				JANESSA
		Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!

	Boeman yanks the lever.

	As the others climb into the lab --

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Depressurization inconclusive.

				KAY-EM 14
		We've lost too much pressure. An hour, tops.

				JANESSA
			(to Rizzo)
		You happy? You've killed us all!

	Thorgan rushes over to the big Nano-tech machine. Places his broken arm 
	on the slab.
	The machine quickly goes to work.

	A schematic of his arm appears on the wall.

	Janessa stares at him.

				JANESSA
		What's the point?

	Delongpre shrugs.

				DELONGPRE
		So that's it then.

	It seems it is.

	Janessa stands over Yllo's decapitated body. It's obvious their 
	relationship
	went beyond just teacher/student. There is a loud METALLIC WHINE from 
	the ship's
	hull.

				RIZZO
		What's that?

				BOEMAN
		THat's the sound of deep space attacking the
		integrity of the ship.

				KAY-EM 14
		No...
			(signing)
		That's the sound of the men working
		on the chain gang.

				RIZZO
		Are there any other shuttles?

				JANESSA
		No.

				RIZZO
		Teleportation? Some way to beam us the
		hell out of dodge?

				THORGAN
		You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?

				JANESSA
		A little late to be thinking about
		escape, isn't it?

				KAY-EM 14
		I'll never experience my fantasy of
		three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod.
		Damn.

				THORGAN
		Am I in there?

				KAY-EM 14
		Sory...

				RIZZO
		Hey.

				DELONGPRE
		That's a good fantasy, though.
		Kinky, but good.

				RIZZO
		Hey!!

	All heads turn to Rizzo. She's staring at a schematic of the ship. The 
	left hull
	of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the 
	various 
	system failures. Rizzo points to the right hull.

				RIZZO
		What's this?

				DELONGPRE
		It's the engine, reactors, audiometers,
		it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.

	Rizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls.

				RIZZO
		Can we get through these?

				THORGAN
		Sure but what good will that do?

				BOEMAN
		When the left hull goes, so will the
		right.

				RIZZO
		What if we blow the walkways first?
		Leave Jason over here to go up with
		the ship?

	They stare at her.

				JANESSA
		You know, Yllo seemed to think we could
		catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth
		millions.

	The others stare at her as if she were crazy.

				RIZZO
		Any connection between your reality and mine
		is purely coincidental.

				JANESSA
		I'm just saying.

				RIZZO
			(to others)
		Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit.
		Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up
		the doors and blow the walkways?

				DELONGPRE
		We'd need charges.

				BOEMAN
		We could convert fission transistors.

				THORGAN
		We're not supposed to do that.

				BOEMAN
		What are you gonna do, tell me?

		DELONGPRE
		The engine room will have molecular welders.
		We could seal up the hull.

	A moment of consideration. Could this actually work?

				JANESSA
		YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big
		guy distracted with a blow job.

				THORGAN
		Would you?

				KAY-EM 14
		Now this is getting exciting.

				DELONGPRE
		Remember to roll his balls around a bit.

				RIZZO
		You got a better plan?

	Obviously they don't. They got to work. Boeman grabs a number of devices 
	from under
	a cabinet.

				BOEMAN
		I'll need system four converters.

				THORGAN
		They're back here.

				DELONGPRE
		How many?

				BOEMAN
		Bring 'em all. Let's move!

	Thorgan's still hooked up to the Nano-Tech machine.

				THORGAN
		Hey! I'm not ready.

				BOEMAN
		Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley
		one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there.
		Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.

				JANESSA
		You're so bossy.

				THORGAN
		You're leaving me here alone?

	Delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him.

				DELONGPRE
		Don't blow your foot off.

	They climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear.

				KAY-EM 14
		It's just you and me, then.

				THORGAN
		Come here, might as well fix that arm.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Boeman, Janessa, Delongpre, and Rizzo slowly move through the piles of 
	debris.
	Still burning cargo creates a ghastly image of flickering shadows.

				DELONGPRE
		See anything?

	They move toward the rubble that had buried Jason before.

	CLOSE on the rubble.

	There is an obvious hole dug out from the middle.

				DELONGPRE
		I think I speak on behalf of the group
		when I say this is bad news.

				BOEMAN
			(into headset)
		Thorgan? You coming?!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Thorgan is fooling around in the back of Kay-Em 14's head. The nano-tech 
	maching is 
	doing a full diagnostics.

				THORGAN
			(into headset)
		Almost done.

				KAY-EM 14
		Ow!

				THORGAN
		Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.

				KAY-EM 14
		Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.

	INT. WALKWAY ONE

	Boeman enters, throws his pack to the ground and goes to work ttaching a 
	device to
	the wall of the huge glass connector.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Janessa enters and goes through the same motions.

	INT. WALKWAY THREE

	Delongpre and Rizzo attach a device to the wall.

				DELONGPRE
		Put your finger here.

	SHe does so. Delongpre connects several wires. Rizzo looks nervous. 
	Delongpre notices.

				DELONGPRE
		My father wanted me to be a businessman.

	Silence.

				DELONGPRE
		That's why I'm here.

				RIZZO
		So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against
		your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.

	Delongpre looks at her like she's crazy.

				DELONGPRE
		My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology 
		is part of the business. We happen to get along just 
	fine,
		smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's 
	balls
		for a change.

				RIZZO
		I thought you meant...

				DELONGPRE
		You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh?
		You must have been a very lonely girl.

	Silence. Neither speaks.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Thorgan rips a metallic sink from the wall. It CRASHES to the floor.

				THORGAN
		Sorry, sorry.

				KAY-EM 14(O.S.)
		Who are you apologizing to?

				THORGAN
		Good point.

	INT.  WALKWAY ONE

	Boeman attaches another charge. He's sweating. Nervous. Keeps looking
	over his shoulder. Standing alone on this long walkway is a creepy 
	sight.

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Janessa stops working, listens.

	KA-THUMP -- There's anoise in the Cargo Bay.

	She covers the mike on her headset and calls out.

				JANESSA
		Thorgan, you little shit, is that you?

	No answer. She quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of 
	tranquillizer
	and a monster syring.e She fills this rhino syringe with a massive 
	dosage. Enough to
	bring down a Rhino...or Jason maybe?

	She starts moving down the walkway toward the Cargo Bay.
	Surely she's not that stupid.

	INT.  WALKWAY THREE

	Rizzo is staring at Delongpre as he works on another device.
	Then --

				RIZZO
		When I was four, the ocean quit producing
		life. Too many pollutants. Nuclear testing,
		the occasional terrorist bombing...the
		atmosphere was shit by the time I was eight.
		We moved underground when I was twelve.

	Delongpre stares at her. He doesn't want to speak and screw up this
	rare moment of sharing.

	INT.   CARGO BAY

	Janessa enters. Looks around.

	The cargo bay is dark and looming. Lights flicker. Emergency lights
	strobe. It's hard to make anything out.

	We hear Rizzo speaking Off Screen.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		My father was an army Scientist.
		Genetics. The army thought they could
		develop humans able to survive the Earth
		we had created

	Janessa moves through the debris.

	ANOTHER POV

	We see Janessa come into view.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Jason seemed to have the right stuff.
		Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell
		damage, didn't matter. He just kept
		going.

	INT.  WALKWAY THREE

				DELONGPRE
		Were you close to your father?

	Thorgan interrupts over the headset.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Delongpre? What did you do with the
		chain gun?

	Delongpre frowns.

				DELONGPRE
			(into mike)
		It's on the table where I left it!
		What the hell are you doing?!
		Hurry up!

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I'm on my way.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thorgan, quit screwing around and
		come on!

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I'm coming, I'm coming.

				DELONGPRE
		Sorry, you were saying?

	INT. CARGO BAY

	WATCHER'S POV

	JANESSA approaches the pile of debris where Jason was buried.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		I got along great with my father,
		my mother too. Dad and the others thought
		they could learn a great deal from this 
		thing the army had been keeping on ice for
		over a hundred years.

	Janessa moves the debris around with her foot.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		They were all wrong. They couldn't control
		him.

	INT. WALKWAY THREE

				DELONGPRE
		And what happend to ...?

	Rizzo begins to tear up.

				RIZZO
		I couldn't save them.

				DELONGPRE
		Well, we'd be dead without you.
		You know that, don't you?

	She stares at him.

				DELONGPRE
		It's true.
			(chuckles)
		You caused enough stink that we
		were at least a little cautious.
		Of course this is the first field
		trip I went on that had a body count.

	She gives him a  half smile.

				DELONGPRE
		I'm not much, but I promise, I won't
		let this guy get you.

	Another half smile. It's a sweet gesture, but what can this guy really 
	do?

	INT. CARGO BAY

	JASON'S POV

	He watches Janessa from a  distance. Moving slowly and silently toward 
	her.

	She stands and turns as --

	SERGEANT BRODSKI grabs her!

	She SCREAMS.

	He's covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut.

				BRODSKI
		Where is everybody? What happened?

				JANESSA
		Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!

				BRODSKI
		Give me a break! What happened?

				JANESSA
		Jason. He's what happened. Then 
		Grendel hit Space Lab.

				BRODSKI
		Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands
		on Yllo.

				JANESSA
		Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.

				BRODSKI
		Takes more than a steelbalde to take
		this old dog down.

	KA-THUNK! 

	JASON"S MACHETE THRUSTS though Brodski's gut. Jason spins Brodski around 
	and tosses him to the floor!

				BRODSKI
		Yup, that ought'a do it.

	Jason turns on Janessa.

	She stands frozen in fear.

	Jason raises his machete and --

	JANESSA

	Lights a flare, blinding Jason for the moment. Then she sinks the Rhino 
	syringe 
	into his chest! Jason stumbles...falls hard on his ass and sits there 
	staring
	at her.

				JANESSA
		Well go on! Pass out!

	Jason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside.

				JANESSA
		Shit.

	Jason starts to climb to his feet. Janessa turns to run.

				BRODSKI
			(weak)
		He-help me...

	He holds his hand out to her. Then--

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		I'm blowing Walkway One. Hold on.

	KA-FOOM! The SHIP BUCKS!

	Janessa runs, leaving the sergeant behind.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - OUTSIDE WALKWAY THREE

	Delongpre closes the door, then --

				DELONGPRE
		We're blowing three. Hang on.

	He throws a switch!

	INT. CARGO BAY - BRIDGE SIDE

	Boeman vaults over a pile of rubble.

				BOEMAN
		Janessa, we're on our way to you!

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Holding hands, Delongpre and Rizzo enter. They stop...stand...stare.

	The walkway is empty. Janessa is gone.

	Boeman rushes up behind them.

				BOEMAN
		Where is...?

				DELONGPRE
		You tell me! She's only set one
		charge. And it's not finished!

	With that Janessa tears into the walkway. She's out of breath. She can 
	barely speak.

				BOEMAN
		Where have you been?!!

				JANESSA
		He....He...

				DELONGPRE
		He's coming!!!

	THEIR POV

	JASON moves through the debris. He's coming straight for them.

				BOEMAN
		Run!!

	They race down the length of the walkway. Jason right behind them.

				RIZZO
		We can't lead him into the other hull!

				BOEMAN
		We don't have a choice!

	Boeman slams the door panel. The door slowly rises.

	Jason approaches, stops, stares at his future victims. If he could smile
	with anticipation...he would. He raises his Machete --

	Then stops. Lowers it.

	CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG.

	He turns his back on our heroes. They crane their necks to see what has 
	pulled
	his attention.

	THORGAN marches down the walkway with KAY-EM 14. The new and imporved 
	KAY-EM 14.

	Where her severed arm had once been, a chain gun is now attached. A 
	laser cannon is
	mounted over her shoulder. Her body has been reinforced with steel from 
	around the lab.
	Sinks, trays, you name it. She's the junk yard man's terminator. Then --

				KAY-EM 14
		Do I have to?

				THORGAN
		Yes, I've reprogrammed you.
		You are very brave. Bad ass.

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh, alright.

	KAY-EM 14 INTERNAL SCAN POV

	We see a somewhat computerized image of Jason through Kay-Em's personal 
	scan.
	One the display we see:

	SUBJECT: DEAD
	CHANCES OF FUNCTION: 100 PERCENT
	DOES NOT COMPUTE . . . DESTROY SUBJECT

				KAY-EM 14
		Come on, boy. Let's see if we can
		open up  can'a whoop ass!

	BRAAAATTTT! The chain gun rings! Jason is SLAMMED into the HULL DOORS.

				DELONGPRE
		Holy shit!

	JASON jumps up and rushes at Kay-Em who catches him and tosses him down 
	the walkway --

	BRAAAATTT! Kay-Em opens up again. Kay-Em's weaponry shoves Jason out 
	into the cargo
	bay witha  blur of bullets.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				BOEMAN
		What are we waiting for?!!
		Come on!!

	Our heroes rush down the walkway toward the cargo bay. Boeman and 
	Delongpre go to
	work setting the charges.

				BOEMAN
			(to Janessa)
		Where the hell were you?!!

				JANESSA
		He came for me, I had to run!

				THORGAN
			(into mike)
		Kay-Em, you okay?

	INT. CARGO BAY

				KAY-EM 14
		Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.

	And with that, Kay-Em BLOWS the now standing Jason into another wall 
	with the laser 
	cannon.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

				BOEMAN
		Toss me a chip.

	Delongpre pulls a trinket from his pack and pitches it to Boeman.

				BOEMAN
		Thorgan, you're brilliant.
		Have I told you that lately?

	Thorgan is standing at the end of the walkway staring into the cargo 
	bay.
	He looks sad.

				THORGAN
			(quietly)
		See you around.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Kay-Em 14 marches toward the downed Jason, and starts singing an old Sea 
	Shanty.

				KAY-EM 14
		She's the Yellow Rose of Taegu,
		the girl that I adore. Her cunt
		it smells like cock juice; she's
		a good two-dollar whore. You may
		talk to me of Seoul girls or whores
		from Tokyo, but the yellow rose of 
		Taegu beats them all, I'd you know.

	BRATTTT!!!

	Kay-Em blows Jason into --

	INT. HALL BETWEEN LABS AND CARGO

	She kicks him down the long corridor.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO 

	The hull SCREAMS from the exterior pressure. The ship RUMBLES.

				BOEMAN
		I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.

				DELONGPRE
		Then stop talking and work faster!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Jason BURSTS through the debris that had been blocking the Lab!
	Kay-Em enters behind him.

				KAY-EM 14
			(still singing)
		She was a young and charming girl;
		her age was scarce sixteen.

	JASON rushes KAY-EM 14!

				KAY-EM 14
		She took me in and she kicked out
		a sailor and marine.

	KA-CHING!!!!

	His machete bounces off of Kay-Em's new armor.

				KAY-EM 14
		She had no titties on her chest;
		that didn't bother me,

	WHAM!

	Kay-Em 14 back hands Jason across the room. He crashes into the glass
	speciments. Goo and formaldehyde covering him.

				KAY-EM 14
		For what she had between her legs
		was big enough for three.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Boeman and Delongpre are finishing up.

				BOEMAN
		Okay, Janessa, give me your last charge.

	Janessa looks around, then --

				JANESSA
		I...I don't know what I did...

				DELONGPRE
		You lost the charge?

				JANESSA
		He was chasing me!

				RIZZO
		Can we blow it with just two?

				BOEMAN
		If we don't sever the hull completely
		she'll drag us down with her.

				DELONGPRE
		Then what do we do?!

				BOEMAN
		I don't know!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Kay-Em stands over Jason. And for the first time in ten films Jason is 
	in bad shape.
	But still climbs to his feet...slowly.

				KAY-EM 14
		Why you low life, scum sucking,
		rat dick blowing, sum bitch.
		Your mamma must'a had some huge balls.

	Of course, as anyone knows, you don't diss Jason's mother.

	Jason leaps, tacking Kay-Em 14! They roll into another glass case. 
	Glass, formaldehyde and specimens
	rain down on top of them.

	Having lost his machete, Jason BASHES at Kay-Em with his fists. OVER and 
	OVER. He
	catches a rhythm. Kay-Em is trapped below.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

				DELONGPRE
		Well, it was a good plan.

	They look at one another -- hopless. Then --

				BRODSKI(O.S.)
		You stupid bitch!

	Everyone jumps as Sergeant Brodski leans against the walkway door frame.
	He's bound his wounds with a make-shift tourniquet wrapped around his 
	mid-section.

				BRODSKI
		Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!

				BOEMAN
		Sergeant? We thought you were...

				BRODSKI
		Yeah, yeah.
			(to Janessa)
		Well, what have you got to say for yourself?

				JANESSA
		I don't know...sorry?

				RIZZO
		Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.

				BRODSKI
		Bomb?

				BOEMAN
		Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.

	The sergeant tosses his pack to the ground.

				BRODSKI
		How much you need?

	INT. LAB ONE

	WHAM...WHAM...WHAM... A RAIN of firststaking on this droid from the 
	future.

	Finally, Jason stops. Straddling KAy-Em 14 he stares at his kill...until 
	--

				KAY-EM 14
			(condescending)
		That was very good. You should
		feel very good about yourself
		right now. Good effort.
			(tough voice)
		How could you hit a girl you sumbitch?!

	Kay-Em 14 places the chaingun over Jason's chest.

	BRAAAATTTT!!!!

	Jason is blown across the room!

				KAY-EM 14
		Okay, dip shit. Time to finish
		you off so I can go home and boink
		your momma with a corndog. The kinky
		bitch.

	Chaingun and laser cannon UNLEASH A MASSIVE DISPLAY on the fleshly body 
	of
	JASON VOORHEES.

	The top portion of Jason's mask shatters!

	hIS RIGHT LEG IS TURNED INTO A PILE OF MEAT, then blown clean off for 
	good measure!
	Jason falls on his ass!

	He raises his machete arm. A last ditch effort. Could he be that lucky?
	To throw a machete and stop this onslaught?

	CHA-CHING!

	NOPE.

				KAY-EM 14
			(singing)
		Bang, bang Maxewells silver hammer
		came down upon his head. Doo-pee-
		do-do. Bang, bang Maxewell's silver
		hammer made sure that he was dead...

	Jason climbs to his one good leg but i t only serves as a better aim
	for Kay-Em 14.

	KA-FOOM! The laser cannon blows Jason's left arm to hell.

	KA-FOOM! KA-FOOM!

	Two more blasts send Jason flying through the back wall and sliding 
	across the floor.

	KAY-EM 14'S INTERNAL SCAN POV

	This time, Jason's body doesn't move.

	SUBJECT: DEAD
	CHANCE OF FUNCTION: ZERO PERCENT
	MISSION OF OBJECTIVES: COMPLERED

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh...my...god. What have I done?
			(crying)
		Thorgan!

	Kay-Em turns and races down the hall.

				KAY-EM 14
		Thorgan I'm a murderer!

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Boeman and Delongpre hustle to set the final charge.

				BRODSKI
		Blowing the walkway? You come up
		with that yourself?

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo did.

	CHA-CHUNG...CHA-CHUNG. Kay-Em steps into the walkway. She's covered in
	blood.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em!

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing back?!!

				KAY-EM 14
			(sad)
		Sumbitch won't be giving us
		anymore trouble.

				RIZZO
		You killed him?

				KAY-EM 14
			(regret)
		Blew half his skull away, one leg,
		one arm and left his entrails
		stretched across the lab. And look
		at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!

				THORGAN
		You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.

				KAY-EM 14
		A real mamma's boy that one.
		Dissed his mamma and he nearly
		threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.

				RIZZO
		His mother?

				BOEMAN
		What?

				RIZZO
		I don't know. Nothing.

	Suddenly the ship's hull SCREAMS. The ship BUCKS. Everyone tumbles.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry up people! We're running out
		of time.

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	Jason's body is propped up against a machine in the same position we saw 
	it before. This
	mass of torn flesh doesn't move.

	The ship BUCKS again.

	The machine HUMS to life. BUZZING and BEEPING. Suddenly a laser scans 
	Jason's
	body.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	Jason is leaned up against the Nano-Tech machine.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Thorgan runs wire to each device.

				THORGAN
		As long as they're connected we can 
		blow them all simultaneously from
		a safe distance.

				BOEMAN
		Two more charges to go.

	INT. LABE ONE - NANO-TECH MACHINE

	We see a schematic of Jason's battered body on the monitor. Nano-
	technology
	is already at work.

	Hoses and wires now encircle Jason's body. We follow one of the hoses 
	until it ends
	over --

	A WASTE BEND

	nside we see pile of bullets. Stuff falls from the hose. Bullets from 
	the chaingun,
	bullets from  every previous Jason movie. A broken machete blade drops 
	to the pile.
	The tip of an arrow. A couple of knives. A pair of pliers. An ink pen. 
	The skeleton
	of a fish.

	The scanning lasers move to the stump at Jason's shoulder. We see the 
	image as a new arm, fuzzy
	adn distorted, is being constructed.

	On the schematic, we see Jason's internal organs being repaired.

	By now  we've figured out ...nothing good can come of this.

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Kay-Em 14 hits a button. The door begins to slide down slowly.

				THORGAN
		Done!

				BOEMAN
		Let's move out!

				BRODSKI
		Kid, you ever thought about the marine corp?

	Delongpre calls fromthe far end of the walkway, welder in his hand.

				DELONGPRE
		I need another minute. Come on!

	ON OUR HEROES

	Suddenly there is a GRINDING SOUND. Engines WHINE from behind them.

	The group stops and turns.

	The cargo door is starting to smoke. It SQUEALS as it slowly opens.

				BRODSKI
		Well fuck me.

				KAY-EM 14
		No, fuck me.

	The door opens and Jason steps into the walkway.

	But he's no Jason we've ever seen before. His leg and arm are now
	SHINY METAL. His clothes are BLACK, no longer tattered. His mask is 
	CHROME.
	We can't see them, but we know...his insides are in better shape than 
	ever.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em? Re-engage killer instinct.

				KAY-EM 14
		Yeeee-haw!!!!

	BRAAAATTTTT!

	Kay-em firs. But, this time it doesn't seem to faze Jason. SPARKS fly as
	bullets vounce off of his metal limbs.

	Jason swings his new improved machete. It CLANGS off of Kay-Em's armor, 
	removing a hunk of metal.

	Jason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway. Glass CRACKS.
	One of the wires, connecting two charges severs.

				BOEMAN
		Shit!

	Kay-em does a back flip, kicking Jason in the chest. He's shoved 
	backwards.

	Boeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues.

	IT'S MASSIVE! Intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic 
	killer.
	SPARKS FLY. GUNFIRE SOUNDS. Then Kay-Em does a round house kick, but 
	Jason uses 
	his machete as a shield. Kay-Em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee.

	She stumbles...falls to the ground.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em!!!

	Boeman splices the wires together.

				BOEMAN
		Done!!

	Then turns to see Jason approaching.

				BOEMAN
		RUN!!

	But Jason's too close. He grabs Boeman.

	ON KAY-EM

	As her body separates from her legs mid-thigh. CHCHHHHH!
	THRUSTERS IGNITE from her lower thighs.

	As Jason raises his machete to do Boeman in --

	KA-FWAM! Kay-Em slams into him! Knocking Boeman free.

	Jason and the now hovering Kay-Em go at it again.

	CHANG! CLANG! CLUNK! Metal against metal. Kay-Em hovers up the walls, 
	over Jason's 
	head...but Jason has come into his own with these new body parts. She's 
	no match. Finally --

	JASON EMBEDS HIS MACHETE IN KAY-EM'S THROAT

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason rears back and shoves his fist though Kay-Em's chestplate! his 
	fist from Kay-Em's
	chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em! Get away!

	Thorgan moves toward his robotic love but Boeman grabs him and pulls him 
	down
	the hall.

				KAY-EM 14
		That's the best you can do?

	Jason yanks his machete from the side of Kay-Em's neck. Severing her 
	head
	from her body. It flies down the hallway behind the kids.

				KAY-EM 14
		Is that it? Come back and fight like a man!

	JASON 

	Turns his glare on our heroes racing toward Delongpre at the other end.

	DELONGPRE

				DELONGPRE
		Done!

	Delongpre lifts his welder's mask to call to the others when he sees 
	JASON.

				DELONGPRE
		Shit, hurry!

	OUR HEROES

	Run toward the door. But, Thorgan stops.

				BOEMAN
		What...?

	Thorgan turns, runs back toward Jason.

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing?!!

	Thorgan is running to retrieve Kay-Em 14's head. It lies between he and 
	Jason.
	He'll never make it!  Thorgan hits the floor, slides and scoops up the 
	head.

				KAY-EM 14
		I think I'm going to throw up...

	BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

	Jason raises his machete from his belt and --

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Hey, dickhead!

	JASON TURNS AS --

	KA-CHUNG!!!! Rizzo nails him with a metal ar.

				RIZZO
			(to Thorgan)
		Go!

	Jason stumbles backwards then whirls on Rizzo.

				RIZZO
		Oh, yeah, you remember me.

	He sure does.

	She turnsa dn runs.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As the others race into the engien room they turn to watch.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry!

				DELONGPRE
		Faster! Don't we have another gun?

	Rizzo catches up to Thorgan but they have a long way to go
	and Jason is gaining.

				JANESSA
		They're not gonna make it. Close the door
		before he gets us all.

				DELONGPRE
		They'll make it.

				JANESSA
		Close the fucking door!

				DELONGPRE
		NO!

	JANESSA leaps forward and hits the switch. The door begins sliding 
	slowly shut.

				DELONGPRE
		Damnit!

	Boeman hits the button again.

				DELONGPRE
			(glares at Janessa)
		Forget it. I had to rewire it.
		Once it's started it won't stop.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	JASON

	TWENTY PACES BEHIND

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

				DELONGPRE
		Get ready to blow it.

	Rizzo dives, slides under the closing door.

	Thorgan follows her lead, but his slide doesn't have the same force. He 
	stops with the door
	coming down on his lower back.

	Luckily, Delongpre snatches his arms and yanks him through.

	The door closes!

				DELONGPRE
		Now!

	Boeman turns the switch.

	INT.  MIDSHIP WALK WAY

	The charges BLOW! A FIREBALL rushes toward the running JASON!

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

	CLOSE ON DOOR

	AS KA-FWAM!!!

	JASON'S BODY IMPRINTS IN THE NOW SEALED DOOR.

	EXT. GRENDEL

	The walkway explodes, severing Grendel into two separate hulls. 
	The left damaged hull, sinks out of view as the engine side begins
	to pull away. Then --

	KA-FOOM!!

	Grendel's LEFT HULL finallay EXPLODES!! They barely amde it.

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

	The right hull BUCKS from the force of the blast. Our heroes are 
	aireborne for a moment 
	then crash to the floor.

				BRODSKI
		Damage?

	Boeman climbs to a console.

				BOEMAN
		Minimal.

				RIZZO
		We made it?

				DELONGPRE
		I think...I think maybe we did.

	CHEERS

	Thorgan looks into Kay-Em 14's severed head.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em we made it!

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh, goody. I'm so pleased.
		I'd clap if I could.

	Boeman CLICKS on a console keyboard.

				BOEMAN
		I've changed the course for Earth II.
		And I sent a distress signal.

				VOICE(V.O.)
		Roger, Grendel. What's the problem?

				BOEMAN
			(into mike)
		Our ship has been damaged, most of
		the crew dead. We need evac.

				VOICE
		Copy that Grendel. Rescue enroute.
		You should hit EARTH II orbit in fifteen
		minutes. Rescue ETA twenty minutes.

	CHEERS!

				BOEMAN
		We're going home people.

	More CHEERS.

	Rizzo turns to find Delonpre staring at her.

				DELONGPRE
			(big smile)
		See? We're not so bad.

				RIZZO
		Not so bad.

	There's that moment when we think the two might kiss. She takes a step
	toward him. Yes, they are going to kiss --

	BOOM!

	WARNING LIGHTS. WARNING ALARMS. The sound of SUCKING WIND. AS JASON,
	still very alive shoves his fist through the imprinted door with his
	metal hand!

	As he rips a bigger hole to gain entrance our heroes are fighting to 
	hold
	on to anything.

	The Hole is sucking everything not tied down out into space.

	Boeman is the first to reach the reactor room door.

				BOEMAN
		This way!

	He pulls Sergeant Brodski through the door as -- 

	JASON

	Fights his way through the opening in the hull.

	The engines BUCK and begin to SMOKE.

				BOEMAN
		The pressures cause the engines to overheat!
		Hurry!

	Delongpre helps Rizzo and Thorgan to safety.

	Janessa crawls across the floor digging her fingers into the steel mesh.

	SERGEANT BRODKSI

	Lying in the door's threshold reaches out and snags her hand.

				JANESSA
		Pull me in!

				BRODSKI
		I'm pulling, damnit!

	But Jason grabs Janessa's ankle and jerks. She's pulled from the 
	Sergeant's
	grasp.

	She flops around in the sucking wind as Jason watches. He lets go.

	She flies toward the hole, slams into it.

	Everything goes quiet for a moment. As he body has sealed the hole then 
	--

	SHHHHHHHHOOOOOK!

	She's sucked into space in a most grotesque manner.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				BRODSKI
		Well, that's a shame.

	INT. REACTOR CORE

	Hug cylindrical machines run the length of this enormous room.
	They HUM quietly as our group enters.

				BRODSKI
		We need weapons.

				RIZZO
		Weapons? All this technology and
		what good has it done?!

				DELONGPRE
		It bought us some time.

				BOEMAN
		And now we're all out of it.

	Everyone stares at Boeman. He's standing at another console.

				BOEMAN
		The ship's depressurizing, the engines
		overheating. When it  reaches the core,
		we're done.

				RIZZO
		Done?

				THORGAN
		Kaboom.

				DELONGPRE
		Again?! Jesus!

				RIZZO
		Why am I not surprised?

	Thorgan still clutches Kay-Em 14's severed head.

				KAY-EM 14
		You must shut down the engines.

				DELONGPRE
		Then do it. The rescue ship can
		find us here right?

				BRODSKI
		Can't shut em' down from here.

				BOEMAN
		Somebody's gonna have to go back
		to the engine room.

				DELONGPRE
		You ain't catching my ass in there again.

	Brodski, still bleeding, pale, struggling to stand --

				BRODSKI
		I'll go.

	The kids give him the "are you crazy?" stare.

				BOEMAN
		You're too weak. I'll go.

	KA-FWAM! Everyone jumps but this time it's only Rizzo. She broke a metal 
	stand and has
	yanked one of the legs free.

				RIZZO
		You know, this future shit sucks.
		I'll fucking do it.

				DELONGPRE
		You?

				RIZZO
			(mumbling)
		Wait around on your asses all day.
			(turns to Thorgan)
		I'll need a distraction.

				THORGAN
		What kind of a distraction?

	INT. ENGINE ROOM

	JASON is pounding on the reactor room door. A difficult act with the 
	continued pressure 
	trying to suck him into space.

	THEN
				RIZZO
		HEY!

	Jason turns to find Rizzo standing in the doorway behind him. 

				RIZZO
		You want some of me?

	Jason whirls around and lurches toward her clinging to machinery as he 
	goes.


	INT.  ENGINE ROOM CORRIDOR

	Rizzo backs slowly as Jason closes in.

	As he reaches the corridor, she turns and runs.

	RIZZO

				RIZZO
		Come on, keep up.

	Jason barrels toward her.

				RIZZO
		You want some of me or not?

	She stops at a door, but doesn't attmept ot open it.

	Jason comes closer..and closeer...but Rizzo doesn't move --

	Jason moves in for the kill, raises his machete, and --

				RIZZO
		Take your best shot --

	SLASH!

	RIZZO'S CHEST IS SPLIT OPEN!

				RIZZO
			(laughs)
		I'm melting! I'm melting!

	SLASH! Her arm falls to the ground!

				RIZZO
		See now that was stupid.
		Persistent, yes, but stupid.

	Jason shoves his fist, through her chest and into the wall.

				RIZZO
		Not this time, asshole. This time
		I'm gonna watch you burn in hell.

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

	The real RIZZO rips off her virtual reality helmet.

				RIZZO
		Make it fast. He's coming.

	Delongpre is punching numbers into the keypad. Both are wearing 
	headsets.

				DELONGPRE
		Almost got it.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Jason returns to the engine room, none too pleased at being tricked.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue
		ship on radar.

				RIZZO
		Delongpre! Out of time!

				DELONPRE
		Got it!

	Rizzo jersk Delonpre and both spill into the reactor
	corridor. Rizzo slaps the panel. the door closes!
	Shutting out Jason's image.

				DELONGPRE
		Damn that was close!

	WHAM!

	THE ENGINE ROOM door RIPS in half. JASON CLIMBS through.

	RIZZO AND DELONGPRE RUN!

				RIZZO
			(into radio)
		Guys, he's right behind us!

		THORGAN(V.O.)
		It's okay.

		DELONGPRE
		Okay?!!

		THORGAN(V.O.)
		Just come on, I've got an idea.

	They race down the long corridor toward the reactor room.
	JASON IN PURSUIT.

	INT. DOCKING BAY

	Thorgan is typing like mad at small portable keyboard.
	Boeman stares out the docking bay window.

	HIS POV 

	There's damage, lots of it.

				BOEMAN
			(into radio)
		The docking bay was damaged after the
		explosion. Meet us at the airlock.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM corridor.

				DELONGPRE
		Got it.
			(to Rizzo)
		You ever space walked?

				RIZZO
		Oh sure, all the time.

	They leap through a door, closing it behind them, then keep running.

	BEHIND THEM

	KA-FWAM! Jason barrels right through the door.

				RIZZO
			(into headset)
		Damit, Thorgan, whatever you're doing...
		you'd better hurry!
			(growls)
		I hate the future!

	INT.  REACTOR CORE

	Rizzo and Delongpre enter in a  mad rush. Delongpre closes the door.
	Little good it'll do.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM CORRIDOR

	JASON kicks the door with his metallic leg!

	KA-FWAM! The door shatters and he stumlbes into --

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Forest, cabins, the lake. Everything as we and Jason remember.
	But somehow distroted. A strange hue covers everything.

	No, on second look, it's not exactly the way we remember. The trees are
	strange looking. Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut, but something 
	foreign.
	The cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a 
	camp.
	But the image will do.
					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Thorgan stands at a keyboard clicking away. Boeman is wearing a space 
	suit.
	He's helping sergeatn Brodski into his.

	At the other end of the huge room, Jason wanders ... with confusion.

				THORGAN
		Don't worry. He can't see us.

	Rizzo glances out the docking bay window.

				RIZZO
		Is that...?

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	We see a planet much the same color as Earth, but the continents are 
	wrong.

				DELONGPRE
		Earth II.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Suit up.

	Delongpre leads Rizzo to a suit.

				DELONGPRE
		I'll help you in.

				THORGAN
			(into headset)
		Kay-Em, you've saved our lives,
		you know that don't you?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kay-Em 14's head sits on the floor in the center of room.

				KAY-EM 14
		It was my pleasure, my love.
		Perhaps if all works for the best
		you can rebuild me and we can try that
		doggie style thing again.

	DOCKING BAY

	The others stare at Thorgan...he looks embarrassed to say the least.

				DELONGPRE
		I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.

	ON KAY-EM

				KAY-EM 14
			(singing happily)
		I get no kick from champaign, mere
		alcohol doesn't faze me at all,
		but I get a kick out of you.

				THORGAN
			(under his breath)
		Goodbye, my love.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thorgan, suit up.

				THORGAN
			(to Rizzo)
		This is gonna work. If he sticks to the
		program. Will he? Stick to the program?

				RIZZO
		His mother was killed before his eyes.
		That's what drove him insane. It'll work.

				DELONGPRE
		That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of
		that future shit.

				RIZZO
		Eat me.

	She smiles as she jersk the helmet out of his hand.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason slowly walks beside Kay-Em 14.

					QUICK-CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Jason is walking along the lake when he sees --

	A CAMPFIRE off in the distance. LAUGHTER, SINGING.
	CAMPERS!!!

	He takes off toward the campfire, then hears --

	SPLASHING. 

	He turns.

	HIS POV

	Within the distorted lake, someone is drowning. Could it be a little 
	boy?
	A little Jason from many years ago?

				WOMAN
		Help me!
			(gurgles)
		Jason help me!

	JASON

	Moves toward the beach. Steps partly into the water.

	HIS POV

	THE WOMAN, THE VOICE. IT'S JASON'S MOTHER!

	He turns toward the campfire, back to his mother...what to do?! Then --

	JASON TEARS INTO THE WATER, TRYING TO REACH HER.

				MRS. VOORHEES
		Help me, Jason, please! Help your mother!

	Jason moves closer.

				MRS. VOORHEES
		Don't let me die again!

	As he draws near, she reaches out her hands to him.

	JASON

	Pauses staring at the please for help.

	He stares into her pleading face. HIS MOTHER! After all these years!

	He places his hand over her face, gently, then --

	PUSHES HER UNDER!

	He holds her there.

								QUICK-CUT TO:

	INT. REACTOR ROOM

				KAY-EM 14
		Uh-oh. That's not a part of the program.
		Thorgan, we've got a problem!

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE 

	Camp Cyrstal lake begins to jerk and fade.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Everyone is suited up. Delongpre, the last, is adjusting his helmet.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Oh, shit. He's going to see us.

				DELONGPRE
		Well, do something!

	Thorgan grabs the portable keyboard and starts typing away!

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Suddenly the image solidifies then a number of the aliens from the game
	grid appear. But Jason's seen these guys before. He tears through them.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

				THORGAN
		Shit!

	Boeman hits the door panel to the docking bay. It begins to slowly rise.

				BOEMAN
		Just a little more time.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Jason stands atop a pile of dead alien like some strange Conan in space.
	The image flickers...he  catches a glimpse of our heroes at the end fo 
	the 
	room. He starts toward them.

	Then a huge white fluffy bunny with huge breasts appears before him.

				WHITE FLUFFY BUNNY
			(sings; deep african american voice)
		I'm'a big fluffy bunny...a big white fluffy bunny...

	SWISH! The bunny's head is severed. The image distortss. Again we see 
	our 
	heroes. Jason is closer.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	The door is halway open. Our heroes start ducking under.

	Jason is almost on them.

				RIZZO
		Thorgan!!!!

	He's clicking away like a mad man.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	A ROCK BAND appears playing some futuristic metal. Then CHEERLEADERS in 
	scantily clad outfits. Then a MIDGIT in a cowboy hat riding by on a 
	tricycle. We have now entered Thorgan's twisted streams of conciousness.

	Jason tears through the aboe. His goal now clear. The distractions no
	longer fool him.

	A volley ball court appears with naked girls bouncing around.
	A fat man wearing only a spiked leather Speedo. A huge turtle.
	A couple of goats.

	Nothing is stopping Jason.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Boeman reaches out and jerks Thorgan into the inner air lock.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	The image finally disintergrates.

	Jason finds himself staring at our heroes. He lunges for the air lock, 
	but --

	Sergeant Brodski dives, hitting Jason in the chest and knocking him to 
	the
	floor.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Sergeant!

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Get out of here!

	SERGEANT BRODSKI, still in Jason's clutches, kicks at the door panel.

	The door starts to close as Jason begins hacking with his machete.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		That all you got?!!

	Jason hacks and hack, stabbing through the space suit, until finally, 
	the tough
	old leather neck is silent for good.

	INT.  AIR LOCK

	The door is sealed.

				RIZZO
		He saved our lives.

	Boemen hits another button, and the outer door begins to open.

				DELONGPRE
		Boeman, the ships not here.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Use the thrusters and you'll
		be fine. We'll huddle together
		out there.

	EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF THE GRENDEL

	AS THE OUTER DOOR OPENS, RIZZO UNCOMFORTABLY FIDGETS WITH HER SUIT.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Hey, easy now.

	He points to where her hand hovers over some buttons on her sleeve.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You wanna release your air tanks?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(nervous)
		Okay, good tip.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You'll be fine.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters.
		We'll be fine.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around.
		So far so good.

	WHAM!

	Jason starts pounding from the other side.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Don't worry. He can't get through that door.

	Delongpre's right. This isn't some thin interior door or some
	walkway door reinforced by a high school kid. This is an air lock
	door. Built to withstand laser cannons and meteors.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thrusters.

	CHSHSHSHSH. CHSHSH.

	Our group enters deep space.

	EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF GRENDEL

	Rizzo, Thorgan, Boeman and Delongpre look tiny next to the massive
	right hull. They thrust slowly into space.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, you okay?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		No I'm not okay! I don't
		know what the hell I'm doing!

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You're doing fine. I won't let
		anything happen to you, remember?

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT. DOCKING BAY

	Jason finally gives up with the massive pounding. He steps back.
	Turns, stares at the sergeants' dead body, then looks at --

	THE DOOR PANEL

	He preses the button

	the ari lock door begins to open. Air is suddenly sucked out of the 
	room!

	Sergeant Brodski's body flies out into space. Everything not tied down 
	races out 
	along with him.

	ON KAY-EM 14'S HEAD

	AS it skitters across the floor --

				KAY-EM 14
		Ahhhhh!

	-- and right out the air lock

	JASON 

	holds onto a machine until the door is open, then lets go!
	He shoots out into space.

	EXT. GRENDEL

	Jason flies out of the air lock.

	HIS POV

	He's rocketing right toward one of the space suits!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I think I had some when I was eight.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Did you like it?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I think so, why?

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		He's trying to ask you out on a date.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Shut up, Thorgan!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Delongpre, you don't even know me.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		I know you.

	Suddenly Rizzo is SLAMMED from behind. She and Jason go spinning away 
	from
	the others.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Nooooooo!!

	RIZZO

	grapples with Jason, but JASON IS JUST TOO STRONG.

	Jason holds HER with his good hand and REARS his metallic hand back. 
	He's
	going to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her 
	head,
	when --

	WHAM!

	Delongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms
	sticking through one of Rizzo's harnesses. THe three go tumbling.

	Delongpre clings to Jason's back.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, pull away!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I'm stuck!

	Jason reaches back, grabs Delongpre and jersk him over his head until 
	he's holding Delongpre
	around the thoat. He'll pop his helmet like a cork!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	AS Thorgan and Boeman thrust towards the tumbling mass...

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		We're too far away!

	BACK TO JASON

	AS he tightens his grip around Delongpre's neck. He can't fight back.

	RIZZO is fighting to untangle her harness. We can hear
	Delongpre CHOKING over the radio.

	The three are spinning even closer and closer towards EARTH II.

	Then, Rizzo reaches down. She grabs Delongpre's leg and CLICKS a button 
	on her sleeve.

	KA-CHSSHSH!!!

	HER AIR TANK BLOWS!

	JASON IS THROWN OFF OF THEM!

	But he's still tangled in Rizzo's hoses. And now she has no air.

	Jason turns...grabs the hoses and begins pulling himself
	toward Rizzo and Delongpre.

	He has them...when --

	WHAM!

	BRODSKI

	Still barely alive barrels into Jason, vlinging to his back.
	He turns, slashes with his knife and severs the hoses.

	Jason and Brodski tumble towards EARTH II.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo's turning blue. She's about to pass out, when --

	Delongpre pulls a hose from his suit and hooks it into her tank.

	CHSHSHSH...

	AIR BEGINS TO FLOW.

	Rizzo takes a big GASP...coughs.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You okay?!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(breathing steadily)
		Oh great...yeah, having a great
		time, and you?

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		No thank you, you crazy old woman.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Old woman?

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Well I mean, technically you are old
		enough to be my great, great, great...

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I get it.

	Suddenly Boeman and Thorgan grab them.  The four survivors huddle 
	together.

				KAY-EM 14
		Hello? A little assistance here?

	They turn to see Kay-Em's head floating close by. Thorgan graps at her 
	and pulls
	her head into his arms.

	THE GROUP CHEERS.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Kay-em you okay?

				KAY-EM 14
		I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I missed you too.

				KAY-EM 14
		I love you.

	Those two aren't the only two.

	CLOSE ON RIZZO AND DELONGPRE

	Their glass face masks are touching. They stare into each other's 
	eyes.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Chinese, huh?

	They laugh and turn to stare toward EARTH II.

	EXT.  EARTH II -- ORBIT

	Suddenly Jason's body comes into view. It's racing toward Earth II.
	Brodski riding it like Slim Pickens.

				BRODSKI
		Yeee---Haaaaa!!

	Slowly they begin entering the atmosphere.

	Immediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone. He was a good
	man...stay to the end to make sure the job was done right.

	Spread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, Jason continues his
	descent.

	His fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up.
	It begins to glow. His metallic arm and leg glow.

	Flames build as he rockets towards Earth II.

	Flesh BUBBLES and OOZES.

	His legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from his 
	body!

	EXT.  CAMP SIGHT

	Four kids sit on futuristic sleeping bags around an old fashion 
	campfire.

				KID # 1
		Hey! Check that out!

	They look up and see a blaze shooting towards Earth II.

				KID # 2
		A falling star!

				KID # 3
		It's a meteor dickhead.

				KID # 2
		It's still cool.

	It LIGHTS up the night, then --

	EXPLODES IN A BRILLIANT FIREWORKS DISPLAY!

				KID # 1
		Cool!!!

	From the explosion, one small smoldering chunk falls toward Earth II.

	EXT.  CRYSTAL RESERVOIR

	OUR POV

	As the chunk falls closer and closer we see that it is a glowing chrome
	hockey mask!

	IT HITS THE WATER with a SSSSS!!!!

	BACK TO KIDS

				KID # 4
		Damn! It his the reservoir.

				KID # 1
		Let's go check it out!

	The others agree as they grab their flashlights and head in toward what
	could be a wonderful new discovery.

								DISSOLVE INTO:

	A STREAM.

	The hockey mask washes down the stream, comes to a halt at a pair of
	grusomely charred hands. 

	THE FINGERS,

	TWITCH, curl around the mask, lifting it off camera. AND WE --

	FADE OUT, a familiar KI-KI-KI-KI-HA-HA-HA-HA, resonating as we --

	ROLL CREDITS

	THE END

               OVER BLACK

               Sounds of the innerspaces rushing forward.

               Then a splinter of blue light in the center of the picture.

               It breaks wide, showing the top and bottom a silhouetted 
               curtain of razor sharp teeth suggesting that we are inside 
               of a tremendous gullet, looking out at the onrushing undersea 
               world at night. HEAR a symphony of underwater sounds: 
               landslide, metabolic sounds, the rare and secret noises that 
               certain undersea species share with each other. Also, the 
               hint of familiar music, twisted and distorted by the depths.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  SHARK'S POINT OF VIEW  RISING OUT OF 
               THE WATER, LOOKING AT

               It is a pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-June. We 
               see a long straight stretch of white beach. Behind the low 
               dunes are the dark shapes of large expensive houses. Hear a 
               number of voices singing. It sounds like an eastern 
               university's alma mater, no longer distorted.

               EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  ANOTHER ANGLE

               Around a blazing bonfire, a group of young men and women, 
               beer cans (or maybe a keg) in evidence, as well as the bota 
               Spanish leather wine-bag much in favor by beach and ski-bum 
               types.

               The group is swapping sentimental alma maters, weepily singing 
               eastern Ivy League anthems - Dartmouth, Cornell, Harvard, 
               Penn, etc. Two young people break away from the others. They

               are Tom Cassidy and Chrissie. Behind them, there is 
               considerable necking activity; Tom and Chrissie are more 
               serious.

               TOM

               Makes a clumsy attempt at snaring Chrissie, cups her from 
               behind. She squirms playfully out of his grasp. We discover 
               he's not especially sober.

                                     TOM
                         Hey! Hey hey! I'm with you, right?

               EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE BEACH  NIGHT

               Tom and Chrissie are separated from the others, silhouetted 
               against the fire, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is 
               plodding along in the sand, winded.

               Chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towards the water, 
               leaving Tom reeling atop the dune. As she runs, she is 
               shedding her clothes. Tom is trying to trail her by her 
               clothes, like Hansel following bread crumbs through the woods.

               But Chrissie is way ahead of him.

                                     CHRISSIE
                         C'mon!

               She runs headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly 
               into the water with a light "Whoops!" as the cold water sweeps 
               over her.

               Behind all this, we continue to hear the sentimental, beery 
               chorus of alma maters.

               Then we see it -- a gentle bulge in the water, a ripple that 
               passes her a dozen feet away. A pressure wave lifts her up, 
               then eases her down again, like a smooth, sudden swell.

                                     CHRISSIE
                         Tommy? Don't dunk me...

               She looks around for him, finds him still on the beach, his 
               feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped around his 
               ankles. She starts to swim back in to him.

               EXT. CHRISSIE IN THE WATER

               Her expression freezes. The water-bulge is racing towards 
               her. The first bump jolts her upright, out of the water to 
               her hips. She reaches under water to touch her leg. Whatever 
               she feels makes her open her mouth to scream, but she is 
               slammed again, hard, whipped into an arc of about eight feet, 
               up and down, submerging her down to her open mouth, choking 
               off any scream she might try to make. Another jolt to her 
               body, driving her under so that only her hair swirls on the 
               surface. Then it too is sucked below in a final and terrible 
               jerking motion. HOLD on the eddies and swirls until we're 
               sure it's all over.

               EXT. CLOSE ON TOM ON BEACH

               In his shorts, laughing to himself, turning in slow stoned 
               circles, held prisoner by his windbreaker which seems to 
               have him in an armlock, as he struggles to free his arm from 
               a tight sleeve. As he turns, we hear the alma maters in the 
               background, from the fire.

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

               A shaft of morning sun blasts through the crack between the 
               bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling across the 
               heads of the sleeping couple on the bed. It catches Martin 
               Brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep.  
               The job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on 
               with local fisherman's report and weather.

                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Hayes Landing reports conditions 
                         good, with stripers and jacks. The 
                         Coast Guard has no storm warning 
                         from Block Island to Cape Hatteras; 
                         a light chop with freshening winds, 
                         continued clear and mild... (etc.)

               Ellen Brody burrows her head under the covers, avoiding 
               morning for a few precious minutes more.

                                     BRODY
                         How come the sun didn't used to shine 
                         in here?

                                     ELLEN
                         'cause when we bought the house it 
                         was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the 
                         dogs.

               We hear the scampering toenails of two cocker spaniels 
               scrabbling around the foot of the bed. Brody swings out of 
               bed, wearing shorts, socks, and tee shirt.

                                     BRODY
                         Right.

                                     ELLEN
                         Do you see the kids?

                                     BRODY
                         Probably out in the back yard.

                                     ELLEN
                         In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
                              (she gives it the 
                              Boston sound)

                                     BRODY
                         The kids are in the yahd, playing 
                         near the cah. How's that sound?

                                     ELLEN
                         Like you're from N'Yawk.
                              (gives it Brooklyn 
                              sound)

                                     BRODY
                         Give me 30 years, I'll get it.

               He leads the dogs out of the bedroom and down to the kitchen.

               INT. BRODY KITCHEN - MORNING

               Brody enters, sets down some dog food, goes to make coffee, 
               starts to fill kettle to boil water, the cold water rushes 
               through and out the burnt-out bottom of the kettle.

                                     BRODY
                         Did you burn another kettle? Y'know 
                         you're a fire hazard? This is the 
                         third one!

                                     ELLEN (O.S.)
                         I never hear the whistle.

                                     BRODY
                         Feed the dogs.

               Ellen Brody, a tall, attractive blonde woman, enters from 
               upstairs. She's still slightly sleepy, not what you'd call 
               an "Instant-On" person. Mornings are not her best time.

                                     ELLEN
                         You want to go through those?
                              (she indicates bag of 
                              clothes)
                         I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop.  
                         It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity.  
                         Pick out what you want to keep -- 
                         it's mostly your city clothes.

                                     BRODY
                              (looking through bag, 
                              remembering)
                         I used to wear this to the Garden. 
                         Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.
                              (he puts it all behind)
                         Ship it.

                                     ELLEN
                         Don't be silly - You're going to 
                         make summer better for them...

               Before Brody can answer, Michael, his oldest boy, enters, 
               holding his hand. There is bright new blood on it, but he is 
               sensibly unconcerned. It's a normal childhood scrape.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.

                                     BRODY
                         On the swing? I told you not to play 
                         near there until I sanded it down.
                              (to Ellen)
                         See what your son did?

                                     ELLEN
                         Go upstairs and bring Mommy a band-
                         aid.

               Michael goes on out and upstairs. Ellen fumbles in her pocket 
               and produces Brody's new glasses, which she holds out to 
               him.

                                     ELLEN
                         Don't forget these.

                                     BRODY
                         Oh, yeah.
                              (he puts them on)
                         How do I look? Older, huh?

                                     ELLEN
                         I think they make you look sexy.

               Brody reacts to this, and bends to kiss her lightly. Then 
               more seriously.

                                     BRODY
                         Sexy, hm? What was I before?

                                     ELLEN
                         Older, sillier.

                                     BRODY
                              (as he goes to make 
                              coffee, he fumbles 
                              with the new glasses)
                         I don't want to depend on these 
                         things, y'know - sometimes you can 
                         weaken your eyes.

               He looks out the window to the view beyond, discovering some 
               new wonder in the fresh sunlit morning.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

               Sean, the younger child, is happily romping in the summer 
               air, enjoying the very air he breathes.

                                     BRODY
                         Let's see...

               The phone rings.

               INT. BRODY KITCHEN  DAY

               Brody answers one of two phones on the wall.

                                     BRODY
                         Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm... 
                         Well, what do they usually do, float 
                         or wash up? Really?... okay, I'll 
                         meet both of you at the beach in
                              (checks watch)
                         ...20 minutes, okay? Okay.
                              (hangs up)
                         First goddamn weekend of the summer.

               Michael reenters in bathing trunks, with a towel on his 
               shoulder, his hand washed, holding a band-aid ready for 
               application. Ellen takes it, and bandages the finger with 
               care and affection.

                                     ELLEN
                         There.
                              (to Brody)
                         What was that?

               Michael heads toward the beach.

                                     BRODY
                              (struggling to get 
                              his shirt on over 
                              his glasses)
                         The office.

               He gets his shirt on with Ellen's help. She flicks imaginary 
               dust from the badge on his chest.

                                     ELLEN
                         Be careful.

                                     BRODY
                         Here? You gotta be kiddin'.

               He gives her a light kiss, starts to go, with his cup.

                                     BRODY
                         Love ya.

                                     ELLEN
                              (kissing him back)
                         Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.

               At the door, he takes a windbreaker off a peg and goes on 
               out.

               We can see the Amity Police shoulder patch as he goes to a 
               van parked outside.

               EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - MORNING

               Martin Brody's Country Squire police wagon rushes past, taking 
               the view to an enormous billboard depicting a typical summer 
               day in Amity. A beautiful model splashes in the gold surf, 
               languishing in a Solarcaine sun. AMITY WELCOMES YOU is written 
               above her flailing arms.

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               Three small figures in the landscape, walking the beach. The 
               surf is rough and there is sea-floor debris strewn about 
               from the receding tide.

               CLOSER ANGLE

               Deputy Hendricks is searching the shore about one hundred 
               yards down wind. Meanwhile, Brody, in his casual police 
               attire, and Tom Cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in 
               last night, walk down the beach. Brody fingers the missing 
               girl's shoes, purse and clothes. In the daylight, Cassidy 
               misconducts himself, wavering between inflated maturity and 
               tear-blown adolescence.

                                     BRODY
                         Christine what?

                                     CASSIDY
                         Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one 
                         ever died on me before.

                                     BRODY
                         You picked her up on the ferry.

                                     CASSIDY
                         I didn't know her.

                                     BRODY
                         And nobody else saw her in the water?

                                     CASSIDY
                         Somebody could've -- I was sort of 
                         passed out.

                                     BRODY
                         Think she might've run out on you?

                                     CASSIDY
                         Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman 
                         do that. I'm sure she drowned.

                                     BRODY
                         You from around here?

                                     CASSIDY
                         No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's 
                         in Tuxedo, New York, though.

                                     BRODY
                         You here for the summer?

                                     CASSIDY
                         Some friends and me took a house.

                                     BRODY
                              (genuinely curious)
                         What d'you pay for a place just for 
                         the summer?

                                     CASSIDY
                         A thousand apiece, something like 
                         that. There's five of us. And we 
                         each kick in a hundred a week for 
                         beer and cleaning, stuff like that.

                                     BRODY
                         Pretty stiff.

               A shrill whistle makes them turn. Hendricks is fifty yards 
               away, on his knees. He blows again, a feeble report this 
               time.

                                     BRODY
                         Maybe that's your girl.

               Brody runs toward Hendricks, Cassidy hesitates, then follows 
               with:

                                     CASSIDY
                              (pathetically)
                         You can't make me look -- !

               A skein of seaweed garnishes the base of this isolated dune.

               The booming waves and fizzing surf make dialogue inaudible.

               Deputy Hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as a sheet.  
               Brody tells Cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and 
               ventures up. Hendricks stops him with a wave-off, saying 
               something at the same time. Brody nods understanding and 
               steps up cautiously and looks down. He adjusts his glasses, 
               trying to make sense of what he is looking at.

               Whatever he sees has a marked effect on his entire physique.

               Kicking out with his foot, Brody sends dozens of angry 
               horseshoe crabs into an escape frenzy and they boil over the 
               top of the dune and down its slopes.

               Cassidy takes a few uneasy steps backwards when Brody waves 
               him over. He shakes his head. An awkward moment. Then Cassidy 
               shuffles forward and up the few remaining feet, his eyes 
               looking everywhere but down. Brody says something else and 
               Cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea. Brody puts 
               his hand gently around the quaking man's shoulder.

               Nodding, he starts to look down, an inch at a time. He looks.

               He, too, can't make out what it is at first. Then he 
               understands.

               The jolt that assaults Cassidy is not unexpected. He falls 
               backward in a sitting position as though shot. Nods yes -- 
               it's her. Brody turns and slides off the dune, stumbling 
               close. Hear his breathing. He looks around, envisioning the 
               week ahead of him....

               QUICK SHARP CUT

               Chrissie's remains, incomplete from the chest down, horribly 
               bitten. (NOTE: See Hooper's dialog in Sc. 91 for complete 
               description of corpse.)

               INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Brody walks through the door and enters his office, holding 
               a fizzing glass of Alka-Seltzer. Polly, his sixty-one year 
               old secretary follows close on his heels with her shorthand 
               pad of messages and reminders.

               In the outer office, Hendricks and Cassidy slump into chairs, 
               sipping from fizzing dixie cups.

               Brody dips into file drawers for the appropriate forms. He 
               gently turns on Polly, who is behind him.

                                     BRODY
                         If this is going to work, you've got 
                         to keep current stuff out here, and 
                         put 'closed' files in there. The 
                         'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay?

               Brody slips behind his typewriter, putting paper in the 
               machine with the effortless ease of years of practice. He's 
               obviously no stranger to paperwork. He touch types, hardly 
               ever looking down, checking his notes and listening with one 
               ear to Polly.

               He is affected by what he's seen, but there's work to be 
               done.

                                     POLLY
                         This is in no order of importance, 
                         Chief: There's a meeting on the Amity 
                         Town Council on Aging this Monday 
                         night, Bentoncourt Hall. The Fire 
                         Inspector wants you to go over the 
                         fireworks site with him before he 
                         catches the one o'clock ferry. Mainly, 
                         you have a batch of calls about that 
                         new Karate school.

               CLOSE - ACCIDENT REPORT

               Brody has just typed the girl's name. He skips the space for 
               Cause-of-Death, and just under it types the Next-of-Kin 
               information he has collected from her wallet.

                                     POLLY
                         Searle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy Ale, 
                         Tisberry's Hardware... they say it's 
                         those nine-year-olds from the school 
                         practicing karate on all those nice 
                         picket fences.

               The phone rings and Polly picks it up.

                                     POLLY
                         It's the Coroner. Somebody pass away 
                         in the night?

               Brody nestles the phone between ear and collar, listening, 
               as he turns to the typewriter.

                                     BRODY
                         Jesus, Santos.

               INSERT - ACCIDENT REPORT

               Cause-of-Death line rolls into place. The hammers punch out: 
               SHARK ATTACK.

               BRODY

               leans forward, staring at what he just wrote. Polly cocks 
               her head and removes the phone from his ear.

                                     POLLY
                         What's the matter?

               Brody takes a breath. A new resolve comes over him.

                                     BRODY
                         Polly, I want to know what water 
                         recreation is on for today.

                                     POLLY
                         Right this minute?

               Brody gets up and moves hastily toward the door.

               BRODY'S OUTER OFFICE

               Cassidy and Hendricks look up as Brody enters.

                                     BRODY
                              (To Hendricks)
                         Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' 
                         signs?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         We never had any. What's the problem?

               A local merchant comes through the door.

                                     LOCAL MERCHANT
                         Glad I caught you. There's a city 
                         truck with New Hampshire plates parked 
                         right in front of my...

               Brody pushes past him and out the door.

               EXT. AMITY MAIN STREET  DAY

               In the busy center of a town preparing for the big Fourth of 
               July weekend, Brody wends his way around sidewalk activity, 
               purpose and haste in each stride. As he turns a corner a 
               little man in a white smock emerges from the Funeral Parlor.

               This is Carl Santos, Amity's part-time coroner. Santos looks 
               both ways before crossing Colonial Drive.

               Brody passes Keisel's Bicycle Rental, navigating an awkward 
               course through an odd assortment of Schwinns that line the 
               sidewalk in front of a demolished white picket fence. Keisel 
               intercepts Brody on the run.

                                     KEISEL
                              (he stares at Brody's 
                              face)
                         Wait-a-minute.
                              (stares some more)
                         Glasses, right?

               Brody nods yes, and starts to move away, but Keisel holds on 
               to him.

                                     KEISEL
                         Look at those fences! Little guys 
                         about eight to ten years old. And 
                         look at this!

               He holds up bicycle. The bicycle's spokes are bent and broken 
               from some sort of blows.

                                     KEISEL
                         They did that with their bare hands.

                                     BRODY
                         Call me later in the day, okay, Harry?

               ANGLE - AMITY GAZETTE NEWSPAPER OFFICE - PORCH

               Santos emerges with Ben Meadows, the stylish, late-thirties 
               editor of the Amity Gazette. Together they cut a beeline for 
               the other side of the street.

               ANGLE - AMITY STREET

               Past taverns and chowder shacks, past bleacher construction 
               and July Fourth posters, Brody enters Hardware and Sporting 
               Goods... so overstocked that beach umbrellas, aluminum deck 
               chairs, and rainbow beach towels splash a surplus of color 
               from the display window to the sidewalk.

               INT. HARDWARE STORE  DAY

               The store proprietor is busy at work on an inventory list 
               with a mainland delivery man.

                                     LYNWOOD
                         Stuff's no good to me in August when 
                         the Pilgrims come in June...
                              (to Brody)
                         Go on and help yourself to whatever 
                         you need, Chief. Can you work the 
                         register?

               EXT. HARDWARE STORE AND STREET - DAY

               Brody emerges with enough poster-board, wooden stakes, nails, 
               paint, and brushes to close every beach on the island. He 
               starts back the way he came when Hendricks shoots up the 
               street in the patrol jeep. He stops fast enough to call 
               attention, leans out the window.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Polly told me to tell you there's a 
                         scout troop in Avril Bay doing the 
                         mile swim for their Merit Badges. I 
                         couldn't call them in, there's no 
                         phone out there.

                                     BRODY
                              (hands him the sign 
                              material)
                         Get out of there  take these back 
                         to the office and make up some 'Beach 
                         Closed' signs, and let Polly do the 
                         printing.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         What's the matter with my printing?

               EXT. VAUGHN'S REALTY  DAY

               Revealing Larry Vaughn, the Mayor of Amity, exchanging 
               anxieties with Ben Meadows and Coroner Santos and two other 
               city Selectmen. They come out in a group, reach the sunlight, 
               and squint down the street as Brody careens around the corner 
               and out of sight. Deputy Hendricks, laden with his arts and 
               crafts, passes them on the street front.

                                     VAUGHN
                         What have you got there, Lenny?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         We had a shark attack at South Chop 
                         this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta 
                         batten down the beach.

               Vaughn and group exchange horrified looks, but we get the 
               impression it is not in response to the shark-attack news.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Who've you told this to, Lenny?

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I just found out about it -- but 
                         there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the 
                         water a coupla miles down the coast 
                         from where we found the girl. Avril 
                         Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry 
                         them off.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Meadows)
                         Take my car, okay?
                              (to Hendricks)
                         You come with us, Lenny.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         I've got all these signs here...

                                     VAUGHN
                         C'mon, it'll give us time to think 
                         about what they're going to say.

               They all crowd into a Cadillac El Dorado with Vaughn Realty 
               signs on the doors.

               EXT. AVRIL BAY - DAY

               A flotilla of twenty exhausted Boy Scouts round a buoy that 
               marks the official course. A rowboat with Scoutmaster using 
               a bullhorn keeps pace, and urges the boys on.

                                     SCOUTMASTER
                              (bullhorn effect)
                         Let's go, Robbie. You too, Hofner. 
                         Boyle, keep your head up. Alberts, 
                         keep kicking...
                              (etc., ad lib)

               EXT. ON THE BEACH AT AVRIL BAY - DAY

               Two older Seascouts look on with stop watches and clipboards, 
               while some Parents shade their eyes from the sun, watching 
               their offspring. Brody pulls up in the Amity Police jeep, 
               and starts toward the people. Behind him, Vaughn's Cadillac 
               pulls up and skids to a stop. In it are Vaughn, Meadows, the 
               Doctor, maybe a Selectman, and Hendricks, with his arms still 
               full of sign material. Vaughn intercepts Brody, the others 
               circle around him, effectively slowing his progress through 
               the sand to the scouts.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin!
                              (he catches up with 
                              him)
                         Are you going to shut down the beach 
                         on your own authority?

                                     BRODY
                         Do I need any more authority?

                                     MEADOWS
                         Technically, you need the instruction 
                         of a civic ordinance, or a special 
                         meeting of the town selectmen...

                                     VAUGHN
                              (the good guy)
                         That's just going by the book. We're 
                         just a little anxious that you're 
                         rushing into something serious here. 
                         This is your first summer.

                                     BRODY
                         Now tell me something I don't know.

                                     VAUGHN
                         All I'm saying is that Amity is a 
                         summer town -- we need summer dollars, 
                         and if they can't swim here, they'll 
                         use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long 
                         Island.

                                     BRODY
                         So we should set out a smorgasbord?

                                     MEADOWS
                         We're not even sure what it was.

                                     BRODY
                         What else could've done that?

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Doctor)
                         Boat propeller?

                                     DOCTOR
                         I think, possibly... sure. A boating 
                         accident.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Some weekend tramp accidentally goes 
                         swimming too far, she's a little 
                         drunk, a fishing boat comes along --

                                     MEADOWS
                         Remember when Fred Ganz went 
                         scalloping in his BVD's? He was going 
                         to swim to New Bedford, he said.

               The men all laugh, ad lib their remembrances of this 
               foolishness.

                                     MEADOWS
                         ...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him 
                         in his net...?

                                     BRODY
                              (interrupting the 
                              merriment)
                         Doctor, you're the one who told me 
                         what it was!

                                     DOCTOR
                         I was wrong. We'll have to amend the 
                         report.

                                     MEADOWS
                         We never had that kind of trouble 
                         here.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I don't think you can appreciate the 
                         gut reaction people have to these 
                         things.

                                     BRODY
                         I was only reacting to what I was 
                         told.

               Brody looks out to the water where the scouts are rounding 
               another buoy on the home stretch.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (taking Brody aside)
                         It's all psychological, anyway. You 
                         yell 'Barracuda' and everyone says 
                         'huh'. You yell 'Shark' and we've 
                         got a panic on our hands. I think we 
                         all agree we don't need a panic this 
                         close to the 4th of July.

               Vaughn indicates the beach where the Scouts are flopping out 
               onto the sand, exhausted, glad to be finished.

                                     BRODY
                         I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't 
                         you make Hendricks Chief? His family's 
                         been here since the Puritans -- half 
                         this island are his cousins.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Martin, we hired the best man we 
                         could find.

               All ad lib agreement.

                                     VAUGHN
                         We need someone who isn't prejudiced 
                         by old feuds or family ties, someone 
                         who can referee things.

                                     MEADOWS
                         You have our complete support.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Now then. We've got a vandalism 
                         problem we ought to talk about...

               The others surround Brody as Vaughn leads the way back to 
               the cars, ad libbing their problem with the little karate 
               choppers.

               Hendricks puts the signs back into the trunk of Vaughn's 
               Cadillac. Vaughn waves casually to the Scouts and swimmers 
               who are vigorously toweling off in the background.

               EXT. AMITY STREET - DAY

               In front of Amity's only Music Store, a battered old pick-up 
               truck pulls in to the curb. Quint and his mate cross silently 
               heading into the music store.

               INT. AMITY MUSIC STORE - DAY

               A gently tinkling bell tolls Quint's entrance. Inside the 
               store, a ten-year-old boy is being shown a clarinet. He is 
               playing a mellow low tone, and running "Ode to Joy." Quint 
               looms past him like Neptune rising from the deep, and lets 
               his hand drop on the counter with a slap that sounds like a 
               club on flesh. The Shopkeeper abandons the little boy and 
               meets Quint.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                         Hello, Mr. Quint.

                                     QUINT
                         Four spools of Number 12 piano wire, 
                         Okay? I ordered them.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                              (finding them under 
                              the counter)
                         Yessir, right here. What do those 
                         fish do, eat this stuff?

                                     QUINT
                         They choke on it.

               Without waiting for it to be wrapped, he picks up the gleaming 
               wire in his gnarled fist, and drops a bill on the counter.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                         Bye now.

               No answer from Quint, who stops and sings along with the 
               boy.

               The little kid's music degenerates into a series of awkward 
               squeaks and blurps, as Quint stares at him. Quint continues 
               out the door, threading his way through the people in the 
               street like some great fish. As he gets up into the cab of 
               his pick-up, its door swings open so we can see a crude 
               stylized shark decorating its side. It slams behind him as 
               Quint gets in and drives away.

               EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

               A plump jelly-bowl of a woman plunges into the ocean. There's 
               enough there to satisfy the most gluttonous shark. Buoyant, 
               joyful, she splashes away in abandon. From her, we pan off 
               to reveal other cheerful bathers enjoying that last 
               uncluttered weekend before the season starts in earnest.

               ANGLE ON THE WATERLINE

               A Man and his dog are romping at the water's edge. The Man 
               is throwing a stick out into the surf, the dog, a happy 
               retriever, is bounding into the waves after it.

               TWO YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE BEACH

               A Girl and her Boyfriend leave their blanket and run for the 
               water, playing tag, chasing each other, having a wonderful 
               time.

               ANGLE ON BIRTHDAY PARTY ON THE SAND - MARTIN AND ELLEN BRODY

               He is sitting stiffly in a beach chair, scanning the beach 
               with careful, cautious looks, eyeballing everything that's 
               going on.

               Around their particular blanket and umbrella are a number of 
               adults and their kids, the youngsters gathered to celebrate 
               Michael's birthday. Ellen is dishing out ice cream and cake 
               from a cooler chest to the raucous 10-year-olds. Michael's 
               hand is still bandaged.

                                     MAX TAFT
                              (an adult)
                         Looks like another big season. Gets 
                         worse every year.

                                     MRS. TAFT
                         And none of them from the Island. 
                         Just a lot of bother.

               Brody (and we) hear a shrill scream from the water. He 
               stretches to look past the group, to see what's happening 
               out there.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

               The young lady is disappearing under the water, pulled under 
               the waves by some force. She is shrieking. She pops right up 
               again riding the shoulders of her boyfriend, who pulled her 
               under. She's laughing hysterically. Brody is unamused.

               THE ADULTS

                                     BRODY
                              (to Taft)
                         What?

                                     TAFT
                         Present company excepted, but off-
                         islanders are a pain in the butt. 
                         Pardon my French.

               Ellen captures Sean, and holds him playfully, an example.

                                     ELLEN
                         What about this kid? What if he were 
                         born here. That make him an islander?

                                     TAFT
                         Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an 
                         oven, it don't make them muffins.

                                     SEAN
                         I'm not a muffin! I'm a boy!

               Brody rumples his hair and sets him off to play.

               ANGLE ON ANOTHER SMALL BOY, PLAYING ALONE

               It's Alex Kintner, and his mother, nearby, reading a novel.

               Alex is towing a funny rubber raft, and headed for the water.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         Alex! Alex Kintner! Where do you 
                         think you're going?

                                     ALEX
                         Water. Just once more, please?

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         Let me see your fingers --

               He holds out his hands.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes 
                         more.

               Alex starts for the ocean. Behind him, Michael and his gang 
               are also heading for the inviting waves. Brody is watching 
               them go, his spine rigid with tension.

               MAN AND HIS DOG

               As Alex and the boys hit the water, we see the man throwing 
               his stick into the waves, his dog swimming strongly after 
               it.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               Out beyond the kids and the dog, the Fat Lady is bobbing 
               around, out way too far, isolated from the other swimmers.

               UNDERWATER VIEW - EXT. - DAY

               A fish's-eye view of the bathers: lots of little kicking 
               legs, rafts with tasty arms dangling in the blue, slowing 
               circling, favoring one raft (little Alex's). The Kintner 
               boy's legs and arms are kicking and paddling, producing 
               bizarre underwater vibrations of more than passing interest.  
               Dog goes by, dog-paddling along.

               ON THE BEACH

               Brody is half-rising, looking out over the water. The Fat 
               Lady is not where he remembered her. He scans the water 
               anxiously.

                                     ELLEN
                         Do you want the boys to come in? 
                         Honey, if you're worried...

               A Black Object swims across the water. It's the dog, breasting 
               against the surf.

               ANGLE ON THE WATER - BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               It's the Fat Lady, floating, relaxing. A black object swims 
               up to her. It's not the dog. It rears up out of the water.

               It's a man in a black bathing cap. They exchange distant 
               pleasantries, he strokes away.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - WATER

               Alex Kintner, paddling around, making boat sounds, tooting, 
               going "vroom, vroom."

               ANGLE ON THE BOY AND GIRL

               They kiss, embrace, kiss again. Strong stuff. They sink 
               beneath the waves, knotted in an embrace.

               ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY AND HIS FRIENDS

               He's trying to salvage a soggy piece of birthday cake, holding 
               it above the water, paddling with his other hand. The bandage 
               has come part way loose, and his cut is trailing in the water.

               BRODY AND ELLEN ON THE BEACH

               Ellen is rubbing suntan oil on his back, and he is allowing 
               himself to relax part way. His eyes still nervously scan the 
               beach in a constant surveillance. Mr. Keisel is coming out 
               of the water, toweling off vigorously, exclaiming to himself.

                                     BRODY
                              (to Keisel)
                         How's the water?

                                     KEISEL
                         Too cold. I'm going in again Labor 
                         Day. Hope we get this weather next 
                         weekend.

                                     ELLEN
                         You're very tight, y'know?
                              (digs in)
                         Right there.

                                     BRODY
                         Ow.
                              (he sees something)
                         He's gotta be more careful in the 
                         water...

               ANGLE ON THE GANG PLAYING IN THE WATER

               Michael has just been drenched. He splashes back. A big 
               waterfight ensues, the boys splashing and chopping at the 
               water, shouting battle cries and karate whoops. Alex is 
               paddling around near them, but not involved with them.

               ALONG THE WATERLINE ON THE BEACH

               The Man with the Dog is whistling into the ocean, looking 
               for his dog.

                                     DOG MAN
                         Buster! Hey, Buster! Here boy!
                              (whistles)
                         He continues to ad lib calling his 
                         dog, but there's no answer, no dog 
                         in the water.

               THE WATERFRONT

               A huge splash explodes in the water near the gang, an eruption 
               of foam and spray that stops everyone cold for a moment.  
               They stop to see who was responsible.

                                     A KID (MATHEW)
                         Hey, no fair splashing in the eyes!

               Before anyone can answer, another kid (P.J.) renews the 
               battle, whooping a karate cry, and slashing at the water 
               with his hand like a little kung-fu warrior, advancing through 
               the waves.

               CLOSE ON MATHEW, SPLASHING BACK

               He hits the water, which sprays up suspiciously pink. He 
               stares at it, surprised.

               CLOSE ON P.J.

               His hands are dripping deep pink, the red matting his hair, 
               running into his eyes. He looks down. The boys are surrounded 
               with a deep pink slick, their little bodies ringed by a 
               spreading stain of blood.

               ANGLE ON SHORE, A TOURIST AND HIS WIFE

               He's pointing frantically out to sea.

                                     TOURIST
                         Something in the water. Right there! 
                         Didn't anyone see it?

                                     WOMAN
                         There's blood in the water.

               ANGLE ON BRODY

               He leaps to his feet, nearly knocking Ellen over, and starts 
               for the water.

                                     ELLEN
                         What is it...?

               Brody is pelting towards the water. He kicks sand over an 
               annoyed Mrs. Kintner, who looks up, just in time to hear 
               Brody's bellow.

                                     BRODY
                         Michael! Sean! Out of the water. 
                         Everybody out of the water! Michael! 
                         Get out!

               His urgency communicates itself to the others. Ellen snatches 
               Sean up from where he's been playing in the sand. Other 
               parents are calling their kids, hysteria mounting. People 
               rush into the water, dragging their children and families 
               bodily out of the ocean. The first kids coming out of the 
               surf are frantically trying to wash the sticky blood off 
               their bodies. The sight of the red sends the beach into a 
               full panic.

               CLOSE ON BRODY

               He rushes into the water, up to his ankles, and suddenly 
               stops, unable to move into deeper water. He is urging Michael 
               out, holding his hands out to his son, who is slogging through 
               the surf towards his dad. He stands there immobilized by the 
               water, nervously helping people out of it onto the beach.

               ANGLE ON MICHAEL

               As he emerges from the water, Alex Kintner's raft washes in 
               behind him, ripped in half, the water pink, the foam spreading 
               the stain onto the sand as the wave breaks.

               ANGLE ON MRS. KINTNER

               Her voice rising into panic and hysteria with each unanswered 
               cry.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         Alex! Alex? Alex...!

               EXT - THE COUNTY COURTHOUSE AND COUNTY OFFICES - DAY

               We are looking at the closed double white front doors of the 
               building, through which we can hear a rolling boil of agitated 
               conversation. After a beat, they open to reveal Mrs. Kintner, 
               looking as though she has been visited by the wrath of God; 
               in effect, she has. Her eyes are puffy and swollen from 
               weeping, her clothing is put on and fastened awkwardly, her 
               gait is not normal. As she walks toward us, Quint enters 
               with his back to us, they pass without notice; Mrs. Kintner 
               moving out of sight, Quint leading us through the doors into 
               the town hall.

               INT. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

               A crowd of angry men and women throng the central hallway, 
               their voices a babble of confusion. Many of them are gathered 
               around a roughly lettered notice that has been posted on the 
               town's official bulletin board. It reads.

               "A $3000 BOUNTY TO THE MAN OR MEN WHO CATCH AND KILL THE 
               SHARK THAT KILLED ALEX M. KINTNER ON SUNDAY, JUNE 29, ON THE 
               AMITY TOWN BEACH."

               Vaughn and Brody are on the outskirts of the crowd, which 
               includes Meadows, some selectmen, and others.

                                     BRODY
                         Look, I've got to talk to her. This 
                         isn't a contest we want the whole 
                         country entering.

                                     MEADOWS
                         I agree. If she's going to advertise, 
                         I wouldn't recommend out-of-town 
                         papers. Amity people could take care 
                         of this.

                                     BRODY
                         I'm responsible for public safety 
                         around here...

                                     VAUGHN
                         Then go out tomorrow and make sure 
                         no one gets hurt.
                              (addressing the crowd)
                         Everybody, could I have your 
                         attention? Since this affects all of 
                         us, I suggest we move into council 
                         chambers, where there's more room...

               There is a flurry and a bustle as everyone rearranges 
               themselves and makes their way into the Amity Selectmen's 
               Council Chambers.

               INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

               The crowd is thronging into the large room. Already in the 
               room is a solitary figure, standing all the way in the rear, 
               watching everyone as they enter. Against the back wall is a 
               large blackboard used for town business during meetings.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Well, here we all are; anyone have 
                         any special questions?

                                     DENHERDER
                         Is that $3000 bounty on the shark in 
                         cash or check?
                              (laughter from all)

                                     VAUGHN
                         That's private business between you 
                         brave fishermen and Mrs. Kintner.
                              (to Brody)
                         -- Chief --

                                     BRODY
                              (stepping in)
                         I'd like to tell you what we're doing 
                         so far. These are some of the steps 
                         I've taken as Chief of Police...

                                     MEADOWS
                              (leading the direction 
                              of the discussion)
                         What's going on with the beaches, 
                         Chief?

               All react.

                                     BRODY
                         I'll get to that in a minute. First, 
                         I plan to start our seasonal summer 
                         help early, and to use shark spotters 
                         on beaches open to the sea. I'd like 
                         cooperation from local fishermen, 
                         and I've also contacted the 
                         Oceanographic Institute over on the 
                         mainland.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (Interrupting -- sotto 
                              voice to Brody)
                         No need to involve outsiders in our 
                         business, Martin.

                                     WOMAN
                         Are you going to close the beaches?

                                     BRODY
                         Larry and I have also decided to 
                         close the beaches for a short time.

               Pandemonium. A collective nerve has been touched.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Only 24 hours!

                                     BRODY
                         I didn't agree to that!

                                     MRS. TAFT
                         That official business could take 
                         all summer!

                                     MR. KEISEL
                         Maybe it's better to close.

               Two opinions have been expressed, and the crowd takes sides 
               vociferously, ad libbing assent or dissent depending on the 
               point of view held forth.

                     THOSE IN FAVOR

                         MR. WISEMAN
                 We should make sure 
                 there is no danger.

                         MR. HASSETT
                 I didn't raise my kids to be some 
                 fish's lunch! 

                                                       THOSE OPPOSED

                                                       MRS. TAFT
                                               The motel is all I own -- 
                                               you pull the plug on this 
                                               town and I go down the 
                                               drain with it.

                                                       MR. POSNER
                                               Nobody's seen a shark.

                                                       MR. POLK
                                               We'll lose business, we 
                                               lose taxes, we lose our 
                                               shirts!

               ANGLE ON QUINT, THE MAN IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM

               He has just run his large, coarse fingernails over the 
               blackboard. He is a large, rough man, a professional fisherman 
               marked by daily physical toil, About 45 or 50, it's hard to 
               tell where the scars leave off and the wrinkles begin. There 
               is a bit of the showman in him, as well as a bit of killer-
               whale.

                                     QUINT
                              (after taking a deep 
                              breath)
                         You all know me. You know what I do 
                         for a living. I'll go out and get 
                         this bird for you. He's a bad one 
                         and it's not like goin' down the 
                         pond chasing blue-gills and tommy-
                         cods. This is a fish that can swallow 
                         a man whole. A little shakin', a 
                         little tenderizing and down ya' go.
                              (a look to Vaughn)
                         You gotta get this fellow and get 
                         him quick. If you do, it'll bring a 
                         lot of tourist business just to see 
                         him and you've got your business 
                         back on a paying basis.
                              (beat)
                         A shark of that size is no pleasure 
                         and I value my neck at a hell of a 
                         lot more'n 3,000 bucks.
                              (a deadly look)
                         I'll find him for three. But I'll 
                         kill him for ten.

               Crowd reaction.

                                     QUINT
                              (he rises up)
                         The bastard is costing you more'n 
                         that every day. Do you wanna stay 
                         alive and annee up the ten or play 
                         it cheap and be on welfare next 
                         winter.
                              (a final moment)
                         I'm gonna kill this thing... just a 
                         matter of whether I do it now -- or 
                         at the end of summer.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Thank you very much, Mr. Quint, the

               INT. BRODY'S STUDY AT HOME - SUNSET

               A riffly blur, color alternating with black and white. The 
               dizziness stops on a book page showing a black and white 
               rendering of eight species of shark. The banner at the top 
               of the page reads: THE KNOWN AND REPUTED MANEATERS.

               The riffling begins again, stops on a grizzly photograph of 
               scar tissue on six former shark victims. Riffling -- stop.

               Photograph of five Ichthyologists posing on wooden stools, 
               framed by the enormous jaws of a prehistoric shark from the 
               family Carcharodon charcharias.

               BRODY

               his reading glasses reflecting a stack of twelve library 
               books, all on the subject of sharks and shark attacks. The 
               door opens and Ellen enters, quietly, in respect for Brody's 
               mood.

                                     ELLEN
                         Can you stand something to eat?

                                     BRODY
                         Love a cup of tea. With lemon.

               Ellen walks past Brody to the window and looks out the window 
               which overlooks the south bay. It is the hour of dusk.

                                     ELLEN
                         Mikey loves his birthday present.

                                     BRODY
                         Where is he?

                                     ELLEN
                              (with a slight laugh)
                         He's sitting in it.

               Brody gets up, concerned, and joins her at the window.

                                     ELLEN
                         Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty 
                         with a double-knot.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

               Michael is sitting in the boat, but two of his young school 
               chums are in the water, swimming around it. Brody opens the 
               window and calls down:

                                     BRODY
                         Son! -- Out of the water now!

                                     MICHAEL
                         My boat's neat, dad!

                                     BRODY
                              (turning to Ellen)
                         I want him out of the ocean.

                                     ELLEN
                         It's three feet deep, Martin

                                     BRODY
                              (angry now)
                         Michael! Come inside!

                                     ELLEN
                         It's his birthday present, and you 
                         closed the beach, Honey. I told him 
                         not to go in the water after what 
                         happened yesterday. I don't believe 
                         he'll ever do it again.

                                     BRODY
                         I told him not to go out until he 
                         memorized the handbook and the safety 
                         safety regulations, until he was 
                         sure of himself...

               Ellen's eyes drift down to the open book, which is displaying 
               a reproduction of the famous painting "The Gulf Stream," 
               showing a black fisherman in a small dinghy similar to 
               Michael's being assaulted by the jaws of three man-eating 
               sharks, circling his boat.

                                     ELLEN
                         You heard your father! Out right 
                         now!

               SUNSET ON THE BEACH

               Hendricks and another deputy are assisting Brody. Silhouettes 
               of townspeople look on like mourners at a funeral.

               In the background some workmen are taking down the shutters 
               from a quaint summer cottage. They pause to watch the 
               declining moments of the day.

               Three Selectmen also stand watching. One of them seems to be 
               whispering bounty news to three youngish men on a nearby 
               dune.

               Sounds: Surf and hammering.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OCEAN AND PIER - NIGHT

               Selectman Denherder and his buddy, Charlie, a professional 
               angler, row towards a tumble-down jetty that leads fifty 
               feet out into the black water.

                                     DENHERDER
                         You wanna call it a night after here?

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's only two-thirty. What, are you 
                         tired?

                                     DENHERDER
                         Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind 
                         three nibbles back.

               Denherder hefts a bloodstained laundry bag from the 
               wheelbarrow, revealing about a hundred feet of coiled dog 
               chain and a large patched inner tube. Charlie takes out a 
               monster hook and together they push the wheelbarrow onto the 
               rickety pier that is only about five feet across.

                                     DENHERDER
                              (reaching into the 
                              bag)
                         Leg of lamb this time?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin!

                                     DENHERDER
                              (a hyena laugh)
                         We're blowin' half the bounty on 
                         bait --

               The splintered pier sways to and fro as the men reach the 
               end and start to work. Charlie baits the hook with a massive 
               chunk of sirloin while Denherder secures the loose end of 
               chain to a skinny piling. Charlie then fastens the inner 
               tube to the chain five feet from the end of the hook.

                                     DENHERDER
                         One more after this, then I'm going 
                         home.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Set?

               Denherder tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it 
               is. Charlie heaves the bait. Splash! The inner tube follows 
               and both men eagerly watch as it floats seaward, the chain 
               playing out from the wheelbarrow.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tide's taking it right out.

               Charlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling. He 
               turns on his transistor radio and loops one end around a 
               fractured board. Denherder paces, bored to death.

                                     DENHERDER
                         You do this all the time, right, 
                         Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Twenty years.

                                     DENHERDER
                         I can't believe that people pay money 
                         to go fishing. This is really dumb. 
                         This isn't even relaxing... it's 
                         just boring.

               CLOSE - CHAIN IN WHEELBARROW

               Suddenly zipping out, faster and faster, as both men 
               straighten.

               Denherder is goggle-eyed.

                                     DENHERDER
                         Hey! What's this?

               The chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the 
               wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty. A section of chain 
               tangles around the handle and flips the entire machine into 
               the air. Both men watch dumbfounded as the inner tube, racing 
               out to sea in a wake of white water, suddenly dips under.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Look at him take it!

                                     DENHERDER
                         Do I set the goddam hook?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go!

               It is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow 
               pilings.

               CLOSE - PILING

               A lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings SNAP with a 
               resounding CRACK.

               ANGLE - JETTY

               The end of the jetty is yanked loose. Denherder is flipped 
               like a chip over the side and into the cold night water, 
               where he manages to snag hold of a splintered timber.

               DENHERDER'S POINT OF VIEW

               The severed section of jetty, a joined platform of footboards, 
               is being dragged seaward with Charlie sitting dazed on top 
               of it, his lit pipe still going.

                                     DENHERDER
                         CHARLIE! JUMP!

               Charlie rolls into the water, sputters, turns to watch the 
               flotilla of wood draw away.

               CLOSE - CHARLIE

               looking seaward.

               CHARLIE'S POINT OF VIEW

               The end of the jetty makes a 180-degree turn and heads back 
               in his direction.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Holy Jesus Christ!

               Denherder steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out 
               of the water.

                                     DENHERDER
                         Get the hell out! Charlie! Swim!

               Charlie, inhaling terror, trying to slog to shore. The jetty 
               is getting closer. Suddenly, an enormous black fin breaks 
               water like a periscope, making course corrections as it comes 
               for Charlie.

               Denherder jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his 
               balance on his way to help Charlie. Charlie has reached the 
               last pylon toward open sea, and his hands clamber for a hold. 
               But --

               INSERT - CHARLIE'S HANDS

               The algae is too slippery, and his fingers keep sliding back.

               That's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky 
               and Charlie manages, with Denherder's desperate help, to 
               make it safely to shore. The remains of the pier float belly-
               up in the inlet.

               CLOSE ON THE HARBORMASTER OF AMITY - DAY

               He is sitting on a little canvas folding chair, eating a 
               bowl of Cheerios with milk and sugar, watching a panorama of 
               ineptitude and greed unfold before his old seaman's eyes.

               The Amity Pier area is a minor madhouse: out-of-state cars 
               elbow local vehicles for parking space at the foot of the 
               dock, and a parade of bounty-hunting townspeople, islanders, 
               off-islanders, tourist, and others shout and push their way 
               onto the crowded pier, each carrying some bizarre or 
               appropriate tool for the real or imagined capture of an 
               unarmed shark of indeterminate size.

               Rods and reels, drop lines, crossbows, slingshots, harpoons, 
               shotguns, rifles, nets and tridents; every fishing supply 
               store and sporting goods house within a hundred miles has 
               been cannibalized to equip this weird array.

               ANGLE ON BRODY AND HENDRICKS ARRIVING ON THE SCENE

               Not having room to bring their police vehicle anywhere near 
               this mess, they are proceeding on foot into the confusion.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         ...So then Denherder and Charlie sat 
                         there trying to catch their breath, 
                         and figuring out how to explain to 
                         Charlie's wife what happened to her 
                         freezer full of meat.

                                     BRODY
                         That wasn't funny.

               Some of the locals greet Hendricks with occasional nods of 
               recognition, or an ad libbed "Hi, Lenny," or "Hey, Lenny."

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in 
                         Field and Stream.

                                     BRODY
                         Looks more like the readers of the 
                         National Enquirer.

               ANGLE ON BOAT RENTAL - PIER

               An argument is in progress between and Out-of-Towner and the 
               Boat Rental Man.

                                     OUT-OF-TOWNER
                         You're charging me double the usual 
                         rent! I didn't come up here all the 
                         way from New Rochelle to be gouged 
                         by some Yankee Cracker!

                                     BOAT RENTAL MAN
                         Prices go up June First every year. 
                         You want a nice cheap, leaky boat, 
                         you go down to the Hamptons.
                              (he sees Brody)
                         Right, Chief?

               ANGLE LOOKING OUT TO SEA

               Making its way through the channel towards the dock is a 
               sleek, expensive runabout with the name "Fascinatin' Rhythm" 
               on the stern. It's professionally handled, and rumbles in as 
               it coasts in towards the dock area. Some other boats clear 
               the way for it, zig-zagging in the harbor, causing an annoying 
               chop.

               CLOSE ON BOAT

               Matt Hooper, a bearded, bespectacled young man with an intent 
               look, is maneuvering the vessel peering through his windscreen 
               at the ragtag collection of seafaring loonies all around 
               him.

               BACK TO DOCKSIDE

               Hendricks is mediating the argument between the two men, and 
               we can hear a plaintive "But Lenny," from the local as Brody 
               sees something that makes him move towards the other side of 
               the dock. We see him cross to a little boat built for two or 
               three that is settling low in the water as a seventh man 
               climbs in with his gear.

                                     BRODY
                         Hey! You know how many men that's 
                         supposed to hold?

                                     MAN IN BOAT (WALTER)
                         Whatever's safe, right?

                                     BRODY
                         What you got ain't safe. You take 
                         some guys off or you don't go out.

               BEN GARDNER AND HIS BOAT, FLICKA

               Matt Hooper is gliding into the dockside, and Ben throws him 
               a line to help make fast as he moors. It's a small island of 
               courtesy in an otherwise discourteous mob. Hooper nods 
               politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock.

                                     HOOPER
                         Hello.

                                     GARDNER
                         Hello, back.

               He's standing near where Brody is finishing after his 
               encounter with the chummers.

               Brody approaches Ben Gardner.

                                     BRODY
                         You going out too, Ben?

                                     GARDNER
                         Might give it a try. That three 
                         thousand bounty beats working for a 
                         living.
                              (yells to his Mate)
                         We ready?

               The Mate nods "Yes" and starts to prepare to get under way.

               Ben and his Mate move away from the dock, headed towards the 
               channel and the open sea leaving Felix and Pratt to scamper 
               around the dock looking for another ride.

               ANOTHER DOCK AREA, CLOSE BY

               A particularly awkward moment between a small sailboat and a 
               couple of powerboats. The sailboat is trying to hoist sail 
               to make it away from the pier under sail, a real yachtsman's 
               conceit, since Hornblower himself probably couldn't navigate 
               through this mess. Brody, a landlubber for sure, is trying 
               to direct traffic to untangle this new mess.

                                     BRODY
                         Just back up! No, the other way! Cut 
                         it to your left! Your other left! 
                         The big boat, your front end is out 
                         way too far. Little boat, stay still!

               Amidst all this, we can hear the angry shouts of the entangled 
               crews.

                                     SKIPPER 1 (THE SAILBOAT)
                         Dammit, a vessel under sail has the 
                         right of way!

                                     SKIPPER 2 (MOTORBOAT)
                         You schmuck, you ain't under sail, 
                         you're goddam drifting!

                                     HOOPER
                              (stepping in to help)
                         Ahoy, sail! You got an oar? Well, 
                         scull it out!

                                     SAILBOAT SKIPPER
                         Tell that stinkpotter to belay!

                                     MOTORBOAT SKIPPER
                         Tell that ragsetter I'm going to 
                         poke him in the snoot!

                                     HOOPER
                         Just cast off in turn and make for 
                         the channel, OK?

                                     BRODY
                         Thanks.

               Brody starts back towards the shore, Hooper is by his side.

                                     HOOPER
                         Excuse me, I wonder if you could 
                         tell me...

               Before he can finish, Brody spots something on shore that 
               moves him to shout to his deputy.

                                     HOOPER
                              (noticing something)
                         Is that dynamite?

               Brody looks, and stops by a boat that's about to cast off.

               He holds out his hand.

                                     BRODY
                         If that's dynamite, give it here, or 
                         don't leave port.

                                     MAN
                         Aw, c'mon, it's just fireworks. Sharks 
                         like fireworks, it attracts them.

                                     BRODY
                         Hand it over.

               The man passes Brody a cigar box filled with dynamite sticks.

               Brody tucks the dynamite under his arm, and continues down 
               the pier. Hooper is still with him.

               All around them are two distinctly different breeds; the 
               quiet pros, like Ben Gardner, in well-worn, comfortable 
               clothes, with efficient, sensible gear, and the amateur 
               crazies, with all manner of weapons and impractical, silly 
               tourist clothing.

               INT. DOCK SHED - DAY

               Brody is on the phone, talking to his office, trying to get 
               Hendricks' attention. He throws a handful of washers at the 
               window.

                                     HOOPER
                         There's a fantail launch out there 
                         that won't make it beyond the 
                         breakwater.

                                     BRODY
                         You're tellin' me. I swear, this 
                         town has gone crazy.

                                     HOOPER
                         Officer, I wonder if you could tell 
                         me where I could find Chief Brody?

                                     BRODY
                         Who are you?

                                     HOOPER
                         Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the 
                         Oceanographic Institute.
                              (holds out his hand)

               EXTERIOR - OCEAN - DAY

               Ben Gardner's boat is in the lead with Gardner's shouting 
               derisive comments at the crowd headed out from land. The 
               armada is spread out and moving in a ragged circle, fifteen 
               boats in all. One man heaves cherry bombs into the water. A 
               smaller boat going in the opposite direction offers us 
               Barwood, forking spaghetti leftovers into the ocean while 
               his friend pours out a bottle of ketchup.

               A speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading 
               instructions aloud from a book entitled "Sharks - East Coast, 
               Vol. I."

               boatload of impoverished scallop fishermen throw a net 
               overboard, full of gaps and split ends. The professionals 
               look professional, but the landlubbers out for the $3000 
               make it impossible for everybody. Collisions are barely 
               averted.

               THE RUBE GOLDBERG ERROR

               The Out-of-Towner in a small boat is bent over in a life and

               death struggle, his rod in a tight arc. His buddy leaps across 
               to lend a hand.

               Twenty yards away in another boat the same struggle ensues.

               This time it's the overloaded boat with the poor scallop 
               fishermen. Shouts of I'M ON! DIG IN! STRIKE! Then a tangle 
               of tackle springs from the water. They have hooked each other.

               Joy turns to swearing.  Arnold Felix stands up to applaud 
               the mishap, while his buddy Pratt takes careful aim with his 
               Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it 
               were a clay pigeon.  The tangle explodes --

               Both the Out-of-Towners and the Scallop Fisherman falls over 
               backward --

               ANGLE - HARRY'S BOAT

               Three men are aboard, one holding a rod which holds a fast 
               arc. A few yards off stern we see a triangular dorsal fin 
               crossing back and forth, struggling, jerking, the mighty 
               tail threshing. One man is screaming success, the other two 
               slapping the angler on the back.

               CLOSE - PRATT AND FELIX

               They spot it and sour.

                                     PRATT
                         Well, get over there! He ain't caught 
                         it yet!

               The owner of Pratt's boat throws it forward and Pratt removes 
               a .45 automatic from the holster of his belt. He tests it, 
               firing once in the air. As they near the scene of the 
               struggle, eleven other boats begin converging, until --

               HARRY'S BOAT

               Everyone wants to get into the act. They are attacking the

               threshing beast with all they've got. Pratt uses his 
               automatic, another blasts point blank with a shotgun. There 
               are occasional water ricochets and the bounty hunters duck 
               from time to time as bullets skip by. Finally, the shark 
               stops threshing.

               FELIX AND PRATT

               Their boat has moved close to the shark, closer than Harry's.

                                     PRATT
                              (exultant)
                         Hand me that pole! Quick!

               One of his party in the over-filled boat grabs a gaff and 
               leans out to grab the moribund shark. But Harry won't give 
               up the line, still reeling in.

                                     HARRY
                         Beat it! I hooked him!

                                     PRATT
                         How's the family, Harry?
                              (to the man with gaff)
                         Go on and do it!

                                     MAN WITH GAFF
                         We split down the middle?

               Pratt nods reluctantly. The man swings, lodges the gaff and 
               hauls the shark up onto the gunwale. A paroxysm of cheers 
               from the surrounding boats. Smoke flares are fired into the 
               air.

                                     HARRY
                              (a tug-of-war)
                         Let go my shark!

               It is a ten-foot tiger, and what a mess -- splattered with 
               bullet punctures, gashes, bleeding from several orifices. 
               But it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to 
               capsize the boat. Pratt panics and fires six times with his 
               .45. The bullets pierce the shark's head, pass through, and 
               split the fiberglass hull through which a flood of water 
               rises. Everybody stands up as the boat slips beneath them.

               INT. MORGUE - DAY

               The Amity Morgue is also the Amity Funeral Home, a Victorian 
               house that normally serves as the community's mortuary. The 
               Coroner, a professional small-town GP, is standing by as 
               Hooper is speaking into a sophisticated cassette recorder 
               with a headpiece that leaves his hands free for measurement 
               with a calibrator or calipers.

                                     BRODY
                         Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident.

               With a shrug, the Coroner slides open the drawer.

               CLOSE ON HOOPER

               He is looking down as the drawer slides past him, still matter-
               of-fact, turning on his recorder.

                                     HOOPER
                         Victim One, identified as Christine 
                         Watkins, female Caucasian...

               The sheet has just been lifted, and Hooper stares down at 
               the lump on the slab. He stops, turns off his recorder as 
               emotions wage war with his senses. Rationality wins, and he 
               turns on the recorder again.

                                     HOOPER

                                     BRODY
                         No, it was local jurisdiction.

                         isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss 
                         and post-mortem erosion of bite

                         however, teeth and jaws of the 
                         attacking squali must be considered 
                         above average for these waters.
                              (to Brody again)
                         -- Did you go out in a boat and look 
                         around?

                                     BRODY
                         No, we just checked the beach...

                              (turns off the recorder)
                         It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a 
                         boat propeller, or a coral reef, or 
                         Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It 
                         was a shark.

               EXT. DOCK AREA - DAY

               We open close on ugly, open shark's jaws, still oozing blood 
               and gore. As the shark is hoisted up into the air on a gin-
               pole hoist dockside, Meadows is seen passing with his 
               secretary and a photographer from the Amity Gazette. A crowd 
               of returning fishermen from the Armada and townspeople are 
               gathering around the fish as it is hoisted tail-up into the 
               classic sports fisherman's trophy shot.

                         Ginny, get this out on the state 
                         wire to AP and UPI in Boston and New 
                         York. Have one of them pick it up 
                         for the national and call Dave Axelrod 
                         in New York and tell him this is 
                         from me and he owes me one... let's 
                         get a picture.

               As he and the photographer turn to mob, we see Hooper and 
               Brody arriving from the morgue. Hooper immediately heads 
               towards the shark, while Brody pauses and we see a look of 
               relief and delight cross his features.

                                     HOOPER
                         Well, if one man can catch a fish in 
                         50 days, then I guess 50 of these 
                         bozos can catch a fish in one day -- 
                         beginner's luck.

                                     BRODY
                              (crossing to men around 
                              shark)
                         You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch 
                         this?

               Men ad lib "No, I caught it..." "I hooked him," etc.

                                     MEADOWS
                         Okay, everybody, I want to get a 
                         picture for the paper -- could 
                         everyone clear out of the way?

               He continues to call directions and move people out of the 
               way to set up his shot. Hooper is measuring the shark.

                                     MEADOWS
                         Could you get out of the shot, young 
                         man?

                                     HOOPER
                         Who, me? Okay...
                              (he drifts off)

               The men (Felix, Pratt, et al) get Brody to join them in the 
               shot. The whole town and the Armada fishermen all line up in 
               a classic "high school" graduating class shot with the 
               victorious fishermen kneeling in front, and the rest of the 
               Armada and Townspeople arranged behind them. Hendricks hold 
               up the "Beach Closed" sign in ironic victory.

               ANGLE SHOWING VAUGHN APPROACHING THE DOCK

               Brody spots the Mayor coming towards the dock, and detaches 
               himself from the group to join him.

                                     BRODY
                         Larry, if you'd see these clowns 
                         leave, you'd never believe they'd 
                         come back with anything. But they 
                         got him!

                                     VAUGHN
                         That's good. That's real good. Ben 
                         Meadows getting pictures for the 
                         paper.

                                     BRODY
                         Sure he is.

               HOOPER AND THE FISHERMEN

               The men who landed the monster are in a tight cluster, 
               debating something with Hooper, who is dwarfed by the big 
               beer bellies and ham-fisted hands all around him. It's 
               probable we don't even see him.

               The Men ad lib "What kind of shark is this?" "It's a shark 
               like in the movies they got sharks." "It's a man-eater, for 
               sure." "I bet it's a record-breaker," etc.

                                     HOOPER (O.S.)
                         It's a tiger shark. Very rare in 
                         these waters, and definitely a 
                         maneater.

               Hooper enters the circle, and picks up where he left off, 
               measuring the shark's teeth. Others watch him. Charlie and 
               Denherder walk over to the shark. Charlie punches it.

               BRODY AND VAUGHN

               They are walking down to the shark together.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Who's that young man?

                                     BRODY
                         Matt Hooper, the specialist they 
                         send down from the Oceanographic 
                         Institute.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (speaking to everyone)
                         I think we all owe a debt of gratitude 
                         to these men for catching this 
                         monster.

               Brody and Vaughn are by now near the circle of fishermen, 
               who are surrounding Hooper, raising their voices at him.

                                     PRATT
                         Whadya mean, 'Bite Radius?' What's 
                         that?

                                     GAFFER
                         Teeth are teeth, right?

                                     HOOPER
                         I didn't say this wasn't the shark, 
                         I just said I wasn't sure this was 
                         the one...

                                     BRODY
                         What d'ya mean?

                                     HOOPER
                         There are hundreds of different kinds 
                         of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, 
                         white-tips... any one of them could've 
                         attacked. Look -- shark digestion is 
                         slow. We could open this one up, and 
                         find whatever he's been eating is 
                         still inside.

                                     VAUGHN
                         That's disgusting! This is the 
                         largest, meanest, most vicious shark 
                         ever landed off Amity Island, and a 
                         known maneater!

                                     HOOPER
                         Let's just cut him open and see what's 
                         inside...

                                     BRODY
                         Why not, Larry? We could get a 
                         positive confirmation that way.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't 
                         the time or the place to do some 
                         kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. 
                         Ben...
                              (to Meadows)
                         do you have all the pictures you 
                         need?

                                     MEADOWS
                         Plenty.

                                     HOOPER
                         Wait a minute...

               Felix, Pratt and the others ad lib disagreement. "You're not 
               gonna cut up my trophy," etc.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (seeing something 
                              offstage, with low 
                              intensity)
                         I am not going to stand here and 
                         watch this fish cut open and see 
                         some kid fall out on the dock. 
                         Besides...
                              (he indicates off)

               We see Mrs. Kintner approaching, dressed in black.

                                     VAUGHN
                              (to Brody)
                         Chief, I'll take responsibility for 
                         this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch 
                         down before he stinks up the whole 
                         island. Harve, tomorrow you and Carl 
                         take him out and dump him right in 
                         the drink.

               MRS. KINTNER JOINS THE GROUP

               She seeks out Brody, and stops in front of him.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         Chief Brody?

               He nods, she slaps him full across the face. There is an 
               embarrassed silence. Some people leave, following a trend 
               that began with the first mention of cutting open the shark.

                                     MRS. KINTNER
                         My Alex was a beautiful little boy 
                         and you killed him. Did you know 
                         that? You knew there was a shark out 
                         there. You knew a girl got killed 
                         here last week. I just found that 
                         out. But you knew. You knew it was 
                         dangerous, but you let people go 
                         swimming anyway. You knew all those 
                         things, and still my boy is dead now 
                         and there's nothing you can do about 
                         that. My boy is dead. I wanted you 
                         to know that.

               She stops, unable to continue. Her father takes her arm and 
               leads her away. Pratt, Harry and the others trail off after 
               her. During the rest of the scene, the camera tightens in on 
               Brody to the exclusion of the others.

                                     VAUGHN
                         I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, 
                         terrible state.

                                     HOOPER
                         Look, maybe this is the wrong time 
                         to pursue this, but I'm not sure...

               Before Hooper can finish, Brody's shoulders slump and he 
               goes slack.

                                     BRODY
                              (almost to himself)
                         She's right.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Let's all get out of here, this place 
                         stinks.

                                     BRODY
                         I'm going home.

               He turns and leaves abruptly, surrendering the dock to Vaughn 
               and Hooper, who eye each other with mutual dis-admiration.

               INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT - DINING ROOM

               Brody and Ellen, Sean and Michael, have all finished dinner.

               Brody's plate is untouched, a virgin meatloaf. His glass, on 
               the other hand, is well used, with the remnants of a stiff 
               scotch and ice. He is staring across the table at the 
               youngest, Sean, who makes a face at him. He makes a face 
               back.

               They play this game together for a few minutes.

                                     BRODY
                         C'mere and give Daddy a kiss.

                                     SEAN
                         Why?

                                     BRODY
                         Because he needs it.

               Sean gives Daddy the kiss. Brody shoos him and Michael off 
               to bed. Ellen, who is feeling progressively more left out 
               with each passing moment, gets up abruptly and clears a few 
               dishes. Brody is not letting her into his world for the 
               moment, and it shows. There's a knock at the door.

                                     HOOPER (O.S.)
                         Martin Brody residence?

               Ellen opens the door for him.

                                     HOOPER
                         Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband 
                         is here, I'd like to talk to him.

                                     ELLEN
                         So would I. Come on in.

               Hooper enters. He's carrying a couple of bottles of wine 
               which he picked up in town. He sits down near Brody.

                                     ELLEN
                         Would you like something? Some coffee?

                                     HOOPER
                              (seeing Brody's plate)
                         Is anyone having this...?

               He starts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated "go 
               ahead."

                                     HOOPER
                         Dynamite!
                              (to Brody)
                         How was your day...?

                                     BRODY
                         Swell.

               They exchange a long look that evolves into a slightly 
               desperate, but shared laughter.

                                     HOOPER
                              (producing wine)
                         Here... one red, one white.

               They laugh some more. Ellen is again left out of it.

                         Ummm. Really good.

               Brody begins stripping the foil off the wine, screwing in a 
               corkscrew, etc.

                                     ELLEN
                         My husband tells me you're in sharks.

                                     HOOPER
                         I wouldn't put it that way. But I 
                         love sharks.

                                     ELLEN
                         You love sharks?

                                     HOOPER
                         I do.
                              (he tells a story 
                              about his boyhood 
                              and a shark)
                         But you've still got a problem here, 
                         there's a shark just off the island 
                         somewhere.

                                     BRODY
                         How come you have to tell them that?

                                     ELLEN
                         Excuse me, but what are you talking 
                         about? Didn't they catch the shark 
                         this afternoon? It was on the Cape 
                         station news.

                                     HOOPER
                         They caught a shark, not the shark. 
                         Big difference. I could've proved it 
                         this afternoon, by cutting that one 
                         open and examining his stomach 
                         contents. Also, his bite was too 
                         small.

               Brody has the cork out of the wine. Pop.

                                     HOOPER
                         I was lucky to find that in town -- 
                         it's an estate bottled vintage year...

               Brody takes the fine wine, and pours it into his drink glass 
               filling the tumbler to the top with ice cubes, diluted scotch, 
               and the wine.

                                     HOOPER
                              (as Brody pours)
                         We ought to let it breathe... 
                         Whatever.

                                     BRODY
                         Let's all have a drink.

               He extends the bottle to Hooper, who politely accepts a token 
               sip. He takes some for himself, and offers some to Ellen.

                                     BRODY
                         You too, sweetheart...

                         sits in the car the whole way over. 
                         He's got this childhood thing, there's

                         Drowning. Lemme ask you something. 
                         Is it true most attacks take place 
                         in three feet of water, around 10 
                         feet from the beach?

                         Yeah. Like the kid on your beach.
                         I wish I could've examined that shark 
                         they caught...

                                     BRODY
                         Something else. Do most attacks go 
                         unreported?

                                     HOOPER
                         About half of them. A lot of 'missing 
                         swimmers' are really shark victims.

                                     BRODY
                         There's a kind of a lone shark, 
                         called, uh...

                                     HOOPER
                         Rogue?

                                     BRODY
                         Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where 
                         there's food and hangs out there as 
                         long as the food supply lasts?

                                     HOOPER
                         It's called Territoriality. It's a 
                         theory.

                                     BRODY
                         And before 1900, when people first 
                         starting swimming for recreation, 
                         before public bathing and resorts, 
                         there were very few shark attacks, 
                         cause sharks didn't know what they 
                         were missing?

                                     HOOPER
                         You could say that.

               Brody digests all this; confirmation of facts he has gleaned 
               in his newly acquired knowledge of the shark species.

               There is a long pause.

                                     BRODY
                         Why don't we have one more drink, 
                         you and I, and then we go down and 
                         cut open that old shark and see for 
                         sure what's inside him, or not.

                                     ELLEN
                         Can you do that?

                                     BRODY
                         I am Chief of Police. I can do 
                         anything I want.
                              (to Hooper)
                         You want to come?

                                     HOOPER
                         I'm flattered you should ask.

               He gets up and they both start out. Ellen watches them go.

               INT. BOAT SHED - NIGHT

               Dark, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange 
               silhouettes of boat parts and scaffolding. At one end, the 
               large, symmetrical bulk of the shark's carcass lies on a 
               tarp. A single dark figure is bending over the dead shark.

               The large double doors at one end of the shed squeak open, 
               and the Shadowy Figure moves abruptly away from the shark.

               The new entrants move into the shed. It is Hooper and Brody 
               and they are continuing the conversation begun in the car on 
               the way over.

               As the Shadowy Figure moves silently into a vantage point 
               against one wall, he passes through the light from a window; 
               it is Quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize 
               him as he backs against the wall.

                         ...And it was Dartmouth Winter 
                         weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, 
                         and I was her date; then she got 
                         into the fact that her family had 
                         more money than my family, and she 
                         was right -- her great-grandfather 
                         was in mining, and my ancestors were 
                         Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up 
                         and I went home with some beatnik 
                         from Sarah Lawrence.

                         Our friend, the shark.

               They bend over the shape like 18th century graverobbers.

                         We always had a summer place on the 
                         water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so I 
                         figured I'd major in something I 
                         knew about. Oceanography, marine 
                         biology. It was that, or design racing 
                         yachts like my older brother. Hmmm. 
                         He we go. Up the old alimentary canal. 
                         Hold the light.

               We hear a slurp and a squish as Hooper produces a big knife 
               and dips into the shark with a major incision.

                         We open the abdominal cavity and 
                         check the digestive tract. Simple.

                              work)

               From his vantage point, Quint watches, unseen by the two 
               men.

               Brody is holding the light, fighting the gag reflex, 
               fascinated by the bizarre ritual.

                         No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage

                         Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, 
                         anything. They can sense it miles 
                         away. If he's out there, we might be

                         It's a good time, too. They're night 
                         feeders...

               EXT. ABOARD HOOPER'S BOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

               We see Brody, looking sick and nervous, holding on anxiously 
               as the "Fascinatin' Rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling at 
               night. His glasses are already flecked with the white salt 
               of dried seawater. He is wearing a life-preserver.

               Hooper is at the wheel, a chart spread in front of him, his 
               eyes scanning the sea restlessly, checking the dials and 
               gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-finding 
               and "fish-finder" gear mounted in the cockpit. A green glow 
               shines from the instruments on his face. Two closed-circuit 
               TV cameras mounted below the hull flash their pictures onto 
               monitors in the dash.

               In the aisle between the seats is a large container filled 
               with unpleasant-looking bait; Hooper is long-lining for signs 
               of shark, and chumming.

                         he's still here.

               Brody, bored, tired, and slightly queasy, is trying to 
               concentrate on anything but the motion of the boat. He stares 
               at the sophisticated electronics displays.

               He hears something, his eyes widen. It is the "bump-thump"

               Hooper looks up and cuts the wheel hard, as the same time 
               dropping the engines into neutral, and then reverse. The 
               sudden change throws Brody to his knees.

               ANGLE FROM HOOPER'S BOAT: GARDNER'S BOAT "FLICKA" AWASH AND 
               FLOATING DEAD IN THE SEA

               It's what they've just run into -- flooded to the gunwales, 
               loose debris floating around, a tangle of lines and gear 
               looking like floating garbage in the cockpit. Hooper's light 
               sweeps across it.

                                     BRODY

               Hooper cuts his engines and drifts in; he scampers out to 
               the bow of his boat and makes a line fast to the Flicka.

               INSIDE THE COCKPIT OF HOOPER'S BOAT

               The electronic display is showing increased activity, but 
               only Brody, who is clinging to a support for dear life, can 
               see the blips and hear the chatter. Hooper is leaning out to 
               look at the Flicka.

               THE TWO BOATS

               Hooper is examining the Flicka, tying a towline to it.

               The light picks its way across the ruined boat. The rail 
               where a cleat once was is broadly scarred down to the raw 
               timber, and the heady cleat has been torn bodily out of the 
               hull, ripped out screws and all.

               Hooper moves to get a better look, the boat rocks in the 
               swell and from his movement, Brody clutches the rail in a 
               death-grip.

               Hooper goes below decks, getting into his wet suit, buckling 
               on a weighted belt, holding a mask and hot flashlight.

               Hooper takes a last few breaths, orients himself, takes a 
               long, hard look at the quiet, open ocean, and falls into the 
               sea.

               fascinated by the sea like a bird facing a cobra. He is very

               UNDERWATER SEQUENCE - HOOPER

               Hooper descends in a froth of bubbles. Warily he turns a 
               full circle with his hotlight. At first we see nothing out 
               of place about the Flicka except that it is lying so low in 
               the water. But as Hooper travels the bottom looking for 
               damage, he comes across a jagged hole two-thirds of the way 
               forward.

               The hole is about the size of a basketball, and the wood 
               around it has been bashed and splintered. Hooper explores 
               the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sheath 
               and begins to dig at something. Whatever it is comes free in 
               his hand. As he studies his find, his light wanders upward, 
               pointing directly into the dark hole. Hooper looks up...

               Ben Gardner's dead face stares out through the hole in the

               bumps his head in trying to get away, seems to yell through 
               escaping bubbles. We hear the gasping shout as a bubbling 
               roar in the ears. His mask fills with water as he flails for 
               the surface. Miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of his 
               own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with 
               adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried 
               loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the 
               eternity of the ocean bottom. He finally bursts through the 
               surface.

               He is gasping for breath, his whole body vibrating with

               adrenaline in his blood to deprive him of speech.

                         a shark, we're talking about a Shark!

               Brody sinks weakly into a chair. Brody huddles in the stern, 
               Hooper kicks the engine in with a roar, and still a-shiver 
               with excitement, turns the boat and its grim tow back to 
               port.

               Next to the "Amity Welcomes You" billboard is a group of

               slow down to see what's happening.

               Behind the billboard, Brody and Hooper have gotten Vaughn to

                         Well, I'm not going to commit economic 
                         suicide on that flimsy evidence. We 
                         depend on the summer people for our 
                         lives, and if our beaches are closed, 
                         then we're all finished.

                         We have got to close the beaches. We 
                         have got to get someone to kill the 
                         shark, we need non-corrosive mesh 
                         netting, we need scientific support... 
                         It's gonna cost money just to keep 
                         the nuts out and save what we have.

                         I'm familiar with the fact that you 
                         are going to ignore this thing until 
                         it swims up and bites you on the 
                         ass! There are only two ways to solve 
                         this thing: you can kill it, or you 
                         can cut off its food supply...

                                     BRODY
                         That means closing the beaches.

                         something.

               He leads Brody around to the front of the billboard, on which 
               we see that some pranksters have painted a huge shark fin in 
               the water behind the swimmer, so she looks now like a frantic 
               bather fleeing a pursuing monster.

                         Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a 
                         deliberate mutilation of a public 
                         service message! I want those little

                         Larry, we can re-open the beaches in 
                         August.

                                     VAUGHN
                         August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, 
                         and we are going to open for business.  
                         It's going to be our best summer in 
                         years. If you're so concerned about 
                         the beaches, you two, you do whatever 
                         you have to to keep them safe, but 
                         with you or without you, the beaches 
                         stay open this weekend.

               INT. FERRY BOAT - DAY

               Two cavernous iron doors. Then a crack of vertical light as 
               six burly crewmen muscle them apart. The Amity ferry landing 
               is approaching, people in colorful outfits waiting dockside 
               for the first filled-to-capacity shuttle of the summer season 
               and --

               Bach's Little Fugue is the musical accompaniment to this 
               wholly visual montage of disembarkation. The next two minutes 
               should be treated like a "short film" taking into account 
               all of the colors, episodes, faces and behavior of a variety 
               of Americans who colonize Eastern resort communities for the 
               ninety-day season.

               Intercut with this montage is Brody's home, where Ellen, 
               Hooper and Brody are in sweaty, gritty all-out effort to 
               enlist some support. Elements in this montage include:

               A.  A train of cars trundling down the ramp, bumper to bumper.

               B.  Young Beautiful People from Princeton, Yale, NYU, wearing 
               knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in papoose rigs, 
               energized children, senior citizens holding hands on the 
               pedestrian ramp, a few wheelchairs.

               C.  Hooper, bent over the phone: "I know it's a long weekend, 
               could you get me his home phone number?

               D.  Sidewalk vendors hawking "Shark Killed" souvenirs, big 
               photo "Personality Posters" of the dead tiger shark hung on 
               the dock.

               E.  Brody: "You're acting senior officer? Where's Chief Petty 
               Officer Feldman? Where's the Coast Guard Executive Officer?"

               F.  Souvenir stands selling Genuine Sharks Teeth from The 
               Amity Killer Shark, Captured This Week.

               G.  Amity Cab Company, small blue Toyotas lined up with their 
               college student drivers like a bomber wing.

               H.  Hooper:  "Well then, operator, could you try him in the 
               dining room?"

               I.  Brody: "All I get is a recording. Is there some other 
               number I could try...?"

               J.  Station wagons with pale winter faces pressed anxiously 
               to the window. Cadillacs with Rear Admirals at the helm, 
               their wives with blue hair remembering the way from years 
               before.

               K.  Hooper: "When did he check out? Did he leave another 
               phone number?"

               L.  Brody: "How can I reach him in Chambers if he's not in 
               Chambers?"

               M.  Little Karate Hands breaking picket fences.

               N.  Some local delinquents about 10 or 12 years old, towing 
               behind their bicycles a little dead sand shark with signs: 
               "Amity Monster Shark." "Killed Here." 5 Cents a Hit." Etc.

               Then six blonde and tanned Coney Island meatballs descend 
               the ramp. They all wear Men's Club Lifeguard patches and 
               matching collegiate windbreakers. They scour the landing, 
               looking for someone to save.

               The boat is empty. Everybody heading inland, anticipating 
               the best Fourth of July ever. Already there is debris on the 
               docks and the cleaning crew works away at it.

               INSIDE THE FERRY

               As Bach's Little Fugue ends, the six burly crewmen lean their 
               combined weight against the Cathedral doors, closing out the 
               light and locking in the trade. The doors latch shut with a 
               resounding clang!

               ANGLE ON BRODY, NERVOUSLY WATCHING THE BEACH

               He is studying everything, trying to make sure he has it 
               covered as well as possible. He almost doesn't hear the 
               approaching roar of a small helicopter until it settles down 
               behind him, and a Flying Officer gets out, starched, pressed 
               fatigues, a flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dark 
               aviator's sunglasses. The Steve Canyon of Amity. He presents 
               Brody with a clipboard.

                                     OFFICER
                         Martin Brody?
                              (Brody nods)
                         I'll need your signature here... 
                         here... and here.

                                     BRODY
                         What is this?

                                     OFFICER
                         Authorization for direct payment of 
                         flight expenses not directly connected 
                         to a normal mission of this command.
                              (Brody doesn't 
                              understand)
                         You pay for the gas.

               Brody signs. The Officer shakes his head as Brody makes an 
               error.

                                     BRODY
                         I signed on the wrong line...

                                     OFFICER
                         Just erase your signature and initial 
                         your erasure.

               Brody complies, shaking his head. The Officer snaps him a 
               salute, jogs lightly back to his idling copter, buckles in, 
               and gives Brody a "thumbs up" as he lifts off in a flurry of 
               sand and ice-cream wrappers.

               EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING

               And this is it -- the Dawn Patrol, the only forces that the 
               frantic phone calling produced. Hendricks, and the regular 
               summer extra deputies. The lifeguards. Half a dozen state 
               troopers. Some deputies from neighboring towns, and a Coast 
               Guard ensign with a handful of regulars in work dungarees.

               Some of Hooper's friends from the institute.

               Brody and Hooper, badly in need of sleep, are watching the 
               crew straggle in. Already the first of the holiday beach-
               goers are piling out of their cars in a brightly colored 
               cascade of beach balls, umbrellas, blankets, portable bar-b-
               ques, radios, sun visors, reflectors, rafts, balls, tubes, 
               and newspapers.

               Hooper watches one such group: A Family of Ten getting out 
               of a camper-van. He watches in dismay as the family bumbles 
               onto the beach for a day of fun in the sun.

               Brody addresses his troops, such as they are.

                                     BRODY
                         I want to thank you guys from local 
                         agencies for cooperating, and I hope 
                         we won't actually be needing your 
                         services. But I'm glad to have you 
                         here.

               The Men ad lib responses: "Happy to do it," "Any time," 
               "When's lunch?" "I hate holidays," etc.

                                     ENSIGN
                         I want to get our lines and repellent 
                         out, so we better shove off.

               He nods to his men, who head for some Boston Whalers (or 
               similar boat with surf-riding capability) and push off into 
               the surf to patrol the swimming areas.

                                     BRODY
                              (a last caution)
                         We're all on one channel, so let's 
                         keep radio traffic to a minimum, 
                         okay?

               Everyone kind of nods acknowledgment.

                                     HOOPER
                         I hope we get some more help.

                                     BRODY
                         I wish it would rain...

               EXT. BEACH - AMUSEMENT AREA - CLOSE OF SHARK MACHINE

               In a shed near the bandstand, a half-dozen pinball and arcade 
               machines sucking quarters from holiday beach-goers. A 
               mechanical shark traverses the screen, is hit with an electric 
               harpoon and red "blood" blossoms from its side, indicating a 
               hit.

               Sounds of electronic gadgetry, people having fun. Meadows is 
               there writing it all up for the paper. A move away from the 
               screen of this particular machine reveals the arcade, the 
               parking lot, and, finally, the beginnings of the panorama of 
               the beach that July 4th has created.

               EXT. SOUTH BEACH - THE FOURTH OF JULY

               four foot surfer's swell curls and crashes on shore, 
               riderless. The broad sandy beach is a mosaic of summer color 
               as one thousand vacationers practice fun in the sun, but not 
               in the water. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors are 
               everywhere.

               ANGLE - LIFEGUARD STATIONS

               A half-dozen lookout lofts. As many handsome lifeguards with 
               Walkie-Talkies strapped to their trunks and loud-hailers at 
               arm's reach. Bored, two of the hot dogs train their binoculars 
               on some local color.

               ANGLE ON TV MOBILE UNIT

               A TV Mobile Unit Van is setting up: cables snaking to cameras, 
               a camera with a big sports zoom sitting on the platform atop 
               the truck, a spiffy announcer-type in a blazer with his 
               station's call letters on the pocket. Inside the darkened 
               control room, we can see the pale blue squares of monitors 
               in a mosaic against one wall, facing the switcher.

               AT SEA

               Hooper is methodically patrolling in his boat. Tactically 
               flanking a three-hundred-yard apron of black repellent are 
               four small watch-boats. A tiny pleasure boat darts around 
               the repellent line. Farther out, crossing back and forth, 
               are patrol boats. To top it all off, a Coast Guard helicopter 
               hovers and patrols three hundred feet above.

               INT. TELEVISION MOBILE UNIT

               At least eight monitors, reflecting the outputs of three 
               cameras and two tape machines, as well as line, preview, and 
               effects monitors.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 1: Holding on a group of happy citizen-bathers 
               as they unpack their gear, wave to camera, run into the water.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 2: The Repellent Line, set in place by Coast 
               Guardsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping 
               repellent into the ocean.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 3: Close on the Bandstand, where Amity's 
               band is playing lilting patriotic airs.

               After we've seen this activity, we can take a look at what's 
               going on: the preparation of the tape segment for the six 
               o'clock news.

                                     TV DIRECTOR
                         Put 1 on the line. In five. 4. 3. 2. 
                         1. Roll.

               On the "Tape 1" and "Line" monitors, we see Vaughn being 
               interviewed by the Announcer in the blazer.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         ...and with me is the Mayor of Amity, 
                         Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how 
                         about those rumors?

                                     VAUGHN
                         How about them indeed. I'm pleased 
                         and happy to repeat the news that we 
                         have, in fact, caught and killed a 
                         large predator that supposedly injured 
                         some bathers here. As you can see, 
                         it's a beautiful day, the beaches 
                         are open, and the folks here are 
                         having a wonderful time. Amity, 
                         y'know, means 'Friendship.'

               MONITOR: CAMERA 1: As Vaughn speaks to us on the monitors, 
               the monitor for Camera 1 pans over to show a Sightseeing Bus 
               pull up in the parking area, and a horde of media vultures 
               spilling out, carrying cameras with long lenses and tripods, 
               telescopes, sunshades and parasols, all the equipment of the 
               curious and none of the equipment of the holiday bather or 
               swimmer.

               TAPE 1 AND LINE MONITORS: Close on the Announcer, Vaughn out 
               of the picture.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         Also here today is a Marine Biologist 
                         and Research Fellow from the 
                         Oceanographic Institute, Matthew 
                         Hooper. Mr. Hooper, what've you heard?

                                     HOOPER
                         What I've heard and what I've seen 
                         are two different things. I believe 
                         there is a large Great White Shark -- 
                         Carcharodon Cacharias - in the waters 
                         off this very beach, that he has 
                         killed and that he will kill again...

               Hooper's voice fades off as someone at the mixer panel dials 
               his mike off, and brings up the Announcer's lavalier.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                              (moving into center 
                              frame)
                         And there you have it -- two different 
                         opinions, by men of good will. The 
                         holiday crowd here at Amity seems to 
                         be making up its own mind...

               The camera pans off him to a happy family headed for the 
               beach.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 3: Zooms in on the puffing face of the tuba 
               player.

               MONITOR: CAMERA 2: Brody and the Announcer.

               MONITOR: TAPE 1 and LINE: Back on the Announcer, his lips 
               moving, but his sound turned off. We hear, instead, the sound 
               from Monitor Camera 2, Brody and the same Announcer.

                                     BRODY
                         I'm sorry, I just don't have the 
                         time.

                                     TV DIRECTOR
                         Recue the machines. 2, pan off the 
                         Chief and show me some tits and ass. 
                         1, get me some cute kids. 3... see 
                         if you got a shot at the water.

               MONITORS: CAMERAS 1, 2 and 3: The cameras seek out the 
               appropriate activity as the Director calls for it.

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                              (holds up stopwatch)
                         Mayor, 43 seconds, Biologist 45 
                         seconds. That's equal time, right?

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Right.
                              (he presses "Talkback" 
                              button to his 
                              announcer)
                         Jerry, come on in and look at this.
                              (to his headset)
                         Roll 2. In five, 4. 3. 2. 1.

               TAPE 2 - MONITOR:

               Starts showing us the assembled interview segment we've just 
               seen, starting with the Announcer's opening remarks.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O. MONITOR)
                         Amity Island is famed for its clear 
                         air and white sand beaches. But a 
                         cloud appeared...

               His voice is dialed under as the Announcer himself appears 
               in the control room to watch himself on the monitors.

                                     ANNOUNCER (LIVE)
                         Look at that shine on my nose. It's 
                         a beacon.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Close enough for remote.

               As Vaughn begins his spiel again, the other monitors show us 
               the action on the beach.

                                     VAUGHN (V.O.)
                         ...I'm pleased and happy...

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Think we ought to stick around?

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         What else you got?

                                     ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                         Teachers' strike downtown.

                                     CAMERAMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Christenson, this is Al. Union says 
                         time for Engineering Five.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         That's five minutes, guys. Coffee.

               ANGLE ON THE BEACH

               Vaughn is in his shirtsleeves, having slipped out of his 
               jacket.

               He mops his brow, and surveys the beachfront. At this moment, 
               there's nobody swimming. He approaches a familiar Selectman, 
               nods hello, and squats beside him on the sand.

                                     VAUGHN
                         Why don't you get in the water?

                                     SELECTMAN
                         I don't want to wash off my suntan 
                         lotion. I'll get a burn...

                                     VAUGHN
                              (some urgency)
                         Nobody's going in!

               On an adjoining blanket, a spirited Ruth Gordon type is 
               sitting, watching brightly as her manservant, a polished 
               Eric Harrison type, prepares some tea from a thermos.

                                     WOMAN
                         Is there nobody going in? What a 
                         shame. Arthur, should I be going in?

                                     ARTHUR (THE BUTLER)
                              (pouring tea)
                         If you'd like.

               He puts down the tea service, and leads her towards the water.

               At the edge of the sea, she stops, and he walks in.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (as he enters the 
                              waves)
                         It's very nice. Not too cold... Quite 
                         refreshing... Very pleasant....

               He ducks his head under for a final look around. His dripping 
               head rises triumphantly from the surf.

                                     ARTHUR
                         No sharks, m'lady.

               She starts into the water, he takes her parasol, escorting 
               her the rest of the way into the ocean.

                                     WOMAN
                         This is marvelous! Arthur, I want to 
                         come back to this very spot. Will 
                         you make a note of where we are?

               WIDE - ON THE BEACH

               Encouraged by the sight of the Woman and Arthur, and Vaughn's 
               quiet urgings, people begin to wander into the surf, a few 
               at first, and then a rush, as people plunge in and begin 
               enjoying the pleasures of ocean bathing. The Selectman goes 
               in, his family follows, Vaughn watches it all, beaming.

               BOAT #7

               Hendricks is on the radio while a Coast Guard spotter works 
               the sonar.

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. 
                         Over.

               Pan to the water.

               UNDERWATER

               As before, 400 pairs of enticing, yummy swimmers' legs, 
               kicking like animated hors d'oeuvres.

               INT. HELICOPTER - AERIAL VIEW

               A breathtaking view. The copter spotter looks down with naked 
               eye and binoculars.

                                     COPTER SPOTTER
                         Nothing from up here, Daisy. Over.

                         False alarm. Must be this glare.

               ANGLE - BEACH - CLOSE ON BRODY

               He is walking down the beach, threading his way through the 
               happy hordes. Meadows nods "hello."

                                     VOICES
                         Who's scared to go in! I was in! Up 
                         to your knees, yeah -- So come with 
                         me -- I'll go again.

                                     MEADOWS
                         Beautiful day, Chief!

               A group of youngsters playing with Michael Brody's dinghy.

               They are hauling it toward the surf.

                                     BRODY
                         Hey Mikey -- !

               Michael turns as Brody trots toward him.

                                     BRODY
                         You're not going to the ocean with 
                         that, are you son?

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'm all checked out for light surf 
                         and look at it.

                                     BRODY
                         Do me this favor just once. Use the 
                         ponds.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Dad, the ponds are for old ladies.

                                     BRODY
                         Just a favor for your old man.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (confused)
                         Sure, Dad.

               TV CREW - NEAR WATER

               TV cameramen are packing up their gear. For them it's a wrap

               REPELLENT LINE - COUNTY POLICEMAN

               Suddenly his Walkie-Talkie fizzes, and the Copter Spotter's 
               voice overloads the speaker.

                                     COPTER SPOTTER
                         Copter to Daisy! Red Four, Red Four!

               BOAT #7 - HENDRICKS

               Guns are up, heads turning everywhere.

                                     HENDRICKS
                              (into walkie-talkie)
                         Where -- ?

                                     COPTER SPOTTER
                         Went under your -- There!

               The Coast Guard sonar operator spots it and pales. A slick 
               black dorsal fin is slicing a wake toward the swimming area.

                                     SONAR OPERATOR
                         Jesus Christ -- Shark!

               BEACH - BRODY

               Rigid and choked, he almost breaks the "send" button trying 
               to transmit.

                                     BRODY
                         Everybody out! Out of the water, 
                         please -- leave the water, please --

               A lifeguard in a loft behind him begins blowing on his 
               whistle.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               shouting hysterically.

                                     BRODY
                         No whistles! No whistles!

               THE BEACH

               Dozens of bathers halfway out of the water, turn to see. 
               More whistles, and they start toward shore. We hear panicky 
               voices ad-libbing; "Shark," "Look Out," etc. The loudhailers 
               sounding more urgent now, and a contagious dread seizes one 
               person after another. Entire groups of people begin pulling 
               toward shore, some of them obviously trying to control a 
               growing hysteria in others.

               BOATS #6 AND #7

               are converging, heading toward the repellent line as if 
               tracking an underwater shadow. The fin is beyond the repellent 
               cordons and heading into the crowds.

               HOOPER'S BOAT

               Caught on the other end of the line, he is wheeling in a 
               broad, hot-dogger's circle turn, headed back.

               THE WATER - BATHERS

               People begin screaming. Kids are suddenly separated from 
               their parents. Others seem to forget how to swim. One myopic 
               little girl has her glasses bumped off and she begins to cry 
               in blinded panic. Ellen Brody looks around frantic.

               BOATS #2, #3, #4

               The riflemen in the boats are trying to get a bead, but too 
               many civilians create a hazard. The Coast Guardsmen attempt 
               to sever the repellent cord to gain access to the bathing 
               area and the heaving fin.

               THE WATER - BATHERS

               This is a confirmation of our worst dread -- a full-blown 
               headlong water panic. Screaming vacationers claw their way 
               over the bodies of the less able. Some literally attempt to 
               walk over the bobbing heads and glistening backs of others 
               pulling for dry land.

               CLOSEUPS - PANIC

               Horrified faces. Some are stunned and wandering in slow, 
               tentative circles, while others are helped out by friends.

               Five people try to mount a rubber raft.

               Ugly reminders that each of us is Number One.

               Brody enters shot, yelling into his walkie-talkie, someone 
               charges past him to help an old man out of the water.

               EXT. THE BEACH

               Dragging the helpless from the surf. Tears well in Brody's 
               eyes. The screaming is deafening. The TV unit is hopping up 
               and down in rage and frustration.

                                     TV DIRECTOR
                         Why did we wrap? Get that! Somebody 
                         get that!

               One thousand survivors pack the beach, standing absolutely 
               still. A numbing cold sets in, and people shiver against 
               each other.

               Muted sobs, whimpering, coughing.

               The six burly lifeguards huddle together like Cub Scouts.

               ANGLE - BATHING AREA

               The monstrous black fin turns a slow circle as two Coast 
               Guardsmen manage to cut their own repellent line. All boats 
               converge on the dynamic fin. Men raise their guns to fire. 
               Others adlib nautical commands in a uniquely calculated 
               fashion.

               CLOSE - FIN

               It slips sideways, revealing for the first time a tiny blue 
               snorkel. Then appears the faces of two youngsters whom we 
               will recall from the coven behind the dune. The fin bobs 
               back, a beaverboard replica attached to a partially submerged 
               surfboard. One youngster looks up and is greeted by:

               YOUNGSTER'S POINT OF VIEW

               Twenty rifles and shotguns pointed directly at him. 
               Surrounding him on three sides. Some of the policemen start 
               to lower their guns -- struck dumb.

               HOOPER IN HIS BOAT

               He throttles back suddenly, subsiding into his own wake, his 
               eyes still restlessly searching.

               CLOSE - YOUNGSTER

               his only defense, he begins to cry -- and feebly raises his 
               hands in unconditional surrender.

               ANGLE - ESTUARY

               The narrow estuary leading into the half-mile is rough today.

               Two children digging in the sand and unaware of the beach 
               panic one hundred yards away look up, and the little girl 
               points.

               BLACK DORSAL FIN

               is cruising through the narrows and toward the busy pond.

               HOOPER IN HIS BOAT AGAIN

               He sees it, and jams his throttle forward. He steers with 
               one hand, fumbling urgently for his walkie-talkie with the 
               other.

               AERIAL VIEW

               The circle of boats around the little pranksters, the crowds 
               huddled on the beach, Hooper's boat suddenly arrowing towards 
               the estuary, leaving a huge boiling wake.

               CLOSE ON VAUGHN

               He catches Hooper's boat out of the corner of his eye. 
               Curious, he follows its progress. It's urgency finally 
               communicates itself to Vaughn, who begins a shambling trot 
               across the dunes towards a rise overlooking the estuary.

               OVERLOOKING THE ESTUARY

               Vaughn gets there just in time to see the disaster. He 
               watches, helpless, trying to shout, out of breath. Stunned.

               ANGLE - POND

               Michael is tacking full-sail in his boat with a friend, Kit.

               Kit is admiring the shark's tooth necklace around his own 
               neck while Michael rubs some water on the scratches left by 
               it.

               The fin, huge, black and real, crosses behind them. They are 
               not yet aware. The fin seems to circle and return. It heads 
               toward Michael's boat when another small dinghy gets in its 
               way -- a weekend novice just finishing a thermos of coffee 
               when he is "bumped." The entire boat is overturned. Michael 
               sees the fin now as it collides with him, the entire bow 
               lifting out of the water and rolling over on the port side.

               Michael and Kit are thrown head first.

               Three heads in the water come up sputtering, the fin between 
               them crossing back. Michael freezes. The fin comes directly 
               at him, growing into the sky, passing him so close he could 
               touch it, but ignoring him as it follows the flailing and 
               panicked weekend novice. Catches him. Michael watches. That 
               all too familiar explosion of water -- a choked off scream -- 
               the head and upper torso of the novice passing Michael swiftly 
               as though being carried off -- a current of blood trailing 
               behind.

                                     THE VICTIM
                              (passing a horrified 
                              Michael, who half 
                              extends one hand, as 
                              if to help)
                         It's no good. I'm dead...
                              (and he is)

               A renewed cry of shark!

               CLOSE - BRODY

               He turns. Oh God! Running through the slogging sand.

               CLOSE - ELLEN

               A sudden turn. She runs.

               CLOSE - HOOPER IN BOAT

               He's got the walkie-talkie to his mouth.

                         Block the estuary! The estuary!

               Three boats racing to carry out the orders. The black fin re-
               passing the two children, racing to get out. Hooper reaches 
               the mouth before the others. The fin won't veer off. It smacks 
               into the little vessel, bumping it aside. The fin is left 
               racing into open water. Blood leavings. Hooper leaping over 
               the side, slogging towards Michael.

               WIDE ON WATER

               Copter roars in buzzing the shark, but too late.

               CLOSE - BRODY AND ELLEN

               They are pulling Michael out of the water as Hooper splashes 
               up. Michael is conscious but in shock -- his eyes staring at 
               nothing.

                                     BRODY
                              (feeling his face)
                         He's in shock. Get blankets!

               People gather and Brody snatches beach towels out of their 
               hands. They cover Michael and carry him off the beach, feet 
               raised above his head.

               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Michael is wheeled out in the bed. Brody and Ellen are there.

               Sean is sleepy in Brody's arms. Vaughn is waiting in the 
               hall.

                         morning.

                         There's only one thing you're good 
                         for anymore -- signing a damn voucher.

                         I'm going to hire Quint to kill the

                         Next summer's had it. You're the 
                         mayor of Shark City. You wanted to 
                         keep the beaches open. What happens 
                         when the town finds out about that?

                                     VAUGHN
                         I was acting in the town's best

                         The best interest in this town would 
                         be to see that fish belly-up in the 
                         water with a hole in his head. You 
                         do the right thing. You authorize

                              (indicates paper)
                         Right there. Whatever it costs.

                         Just sign it, Larry.

               Vaughn signs, and Brody takes the paper and exits.

               QUINT'S HOUSE - DAY

               Brody and Hooper are approaching Quint's house. They enter 
               through the big wooden doors, into another circle of Hell.

               Smoke and steam from two big oil drums sitting over fires 
               fills the air. Quint and his mate, Herschel, are grinding 
               pieces of pilot whale into chum. The whale lies bloody on 
               the floor, its ruined carcass adding to the stench of other 
               sharks being boiled in the drums, their tails suspended in 
               the air.

               Diesel fumes and decay fill the air, and tools, ropes, broken 
               bits of iron and engine parts litter the floor. Wall hangings 
               of rope and floats, and buoys, barrels, tackle and gear all 
               conspire to frame the killing floor.

               Brody and Hooper navigate the obstacle course.

                                     BRODY
                         This has got to be one big 
                         violation...

                         Keep your hands off my stuff.

               He emerges from the steam and smoke.

                         and you buy the lunch.

                         Two cases. And dinner when you land.

                              (pours drink)
                         Try some of this. I made it myself.

                         women.

               Herschel interrupts. He's stopped working, and is wiping his 
               hands on a bloody rag.

                         up in the morning. Then you're on

               Quint turns to see this new voice, and starts walking towards

               EXT. QUINT'S DOCK - MORNING

               The Mate is loading. He hands Quint the items on his check

               As he talks, we see Hooper coming down to the dock. Wheeling 
               a wagon behind him are two long-haired Research Assistants 
               from the Institute. On the wagon, among other things, is a 
               big shark cage. At dockside, Hooper checks his list, as he 
               signs for his issue.

               Its diesels chugging, the Orca pulls away from the pier.

               Ellen has already resolutely turned her back on it, and is 
               walking off the dock back onto dry land.

               ABOARD THE ORCA

               Quint has set a course out towards the open sea. He lashes 
               the wheel, and jumps down to address Hooper and Brody, who 
               are standing together in the stern.

                         little round window.

               He laughs at his joke. This is probably something he tells 
               all his charters.

                                     QUINT

                         ready -- let's go fishin'.

               He starts moving gear around, preparing chum barrels, setting 
               hooks, Hooper gives him a hand, Brody stays out of the way.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE OCEAN - NOON

               It is quiet as the Orca drifts along in the current, a wide 
               chum slick spreading behind it. A couple of flag buoys spread 
               along our perspective show us the miles the boat has gone.

               Quint spots something in the water -- a small blue shark 
               attracted by the chum. He rigs a small pole with a piece of 
               bait, and throws it over the side.

                         Here's something for you...

               The shark takes the bait, Quint brutally and efficiently 
               sets the hook, and reels the shark alongside. He hauls it 
               part way out of the water, and sticks it with a gaff. Hooper 
               and Brody watch.

               Tailrope dropping on him. Gaffed and bleeding, the shark is 
               immobilized by Quint's practiced hands. He takes one of his 
               big knives and poses for a moment beside the struggling fish.

                                     QUINT
                         These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat 
                         their own guts.

               He slices into the shark's underbelly. We hear the sound of 
               entrails plopping into the water. Brody is almost retching, 
               and Hooper is just displeased.

               ANGLE ON THE WATER

               The gutted shark swimming in circles biting at its own 
               entrails.

               Fins closing in on the wounded shark.

               SHARK FRENZY

               A boil of water and the flash of fins and teeth as the local 
               sharks erupt in a feeding frenzy, jaws snapping, blood 
               spewing, a sudden display of the fury and blind predatory 
               drive of the fearsome species.

               EXT. THE OCEAN - AFTERNOON

               The Orca is drifting in neutral. The ocean is like gelatin, 
               the sun sucking heat waves from its surface. Brody at the 
               stern, handkerchief on his head to protect from further 
               sunburn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shark hunt:  
               the ladling out of chum. There are several empty chum barrels. 
               A flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, another waits to 
               be tossed over the side. Brody is reeling with nausea. He 
               opens his overnight kit and takes out a handkerchief and 
               some Old Spice after-shave. He pours the after-shave into 
               the cloth, presses it to his nose. Hooper is also in the 
               stern.

                         Keep that chum line going -- we've 
                         got five good miles. Don't break it.

                                     BRODY
                         Who's driving the boat?

                                     QUINT
                         Nobody. We're drifting with the 
                         current.

                                     HOOPER
                              (using the fish finder)
                         Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         Hell, in the old days we went out 
                         with good charts, good sounding lead, 
                         and a damn good compass. Nowadays, 
                         these kids are afraid to go out 
                         without depth finders, radar, radio, 
                         electric toothbrush, every stupid 
                         thing...

               Quint opens a can of beer and drains it in one long pull, 
               crushing the empty and throwing it over the side. Hooper 
               drains his coffee from a styrofoam cup, and cracks it in his 
               hand with a silly "plup." He stows the pieces in an empty 
               chum barrel.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Get a fresh barrel.

               Brody goes to unlash a fresh barrel, but can't figure out 
               the knots. He finally tugs on a piece of rope, and it all 
               comes loose... barrel, shark cage, and, most important, 
               Hooper's tanks, clattering and rolling on the deck.

                         didn't go to schools in electronics. 
                         He was born with what he does best.

               The men are in different positions on the boat. Hooper on 
               the flying bridge. Quint in the stern, Brody hanging over 
               the rail, puking.

               Quint takes a wide red strip of whale meat and a gnarled 
               squid from the garbage pail, and searches for a No. 2 hook 
               rig. He holds up a strip of whale.

                         situation.

               Brody shades his eyes from the white sun as Quint baits up.

                         size of a radish.

               Quint sits in the fighting chair. He casts off, murmuring as 
               the line feeds out.

                                     QUINT

               LATER

               Quint at ease in his chair, Brody near him, practicing tying 
               knots. The line starts to move, a few feet at a time; both 
               men watch. Then the line whizzes off the reel. Brody jumps 
               up. Hooper springs to the deck. Quint puts his hand on the 
               drag and addresses the situation softly.

                         Hooooooo!

               Quint tightens drag and strikes. The line goes whizzing out.

               Brody runs to Quint's side. Hooper springs up to the flying 
               bridge.

                                     BRODY
                         You got it?

                         Wet my reel, quick!

               Brody goes to get water, the boat surges, he staggers. Brody 
               pours water on the screaming reel, nearly unspooled now.

               Hooper is turning the boat around and the line changes 
               direction.

               Hooper steers it sharply.

               Again the line changes direction, down this time.

               Quint reeling in like mad.

                         Sure -- try it!

               He ad libs brief instructions to Brody as the line rushes 
               out and there is less tension. Quint is horsing up and down, 
               reeling in.

               The line is almost vertical, and Quint shows a hint of 
               bafflement. He reels in suspiciously.

                         Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in

               The leaders show above the water line. Brody is wide-eyed, 
               waiting for that first look.

                         It's too wild, too erratic. It's a 
                         marlin or a stingray. It's a gamefish.

               Hooper snaps the rope onto the leader and holds on.

                         Grab onto this!

               Before he realizes what's happening, Brody is clumsily 
               clutching at the big rod, appalled. Quint skips away for a 
               flying gaff. He picks one, turns...

               That's when the leader lashes free, sending Hooper crashing 
               backward in a serious fall, and the rod whips at Brody's 
               forehead, drawing blood. Quint snatches up the rod and reels

                         back up on the bridge.

                         Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.

               Hooper shakes off his dizziness and obeys. Brody watches 
               Quint rig up a new leader, hook up the same bait.

               Brody goes inside to inspect his forehead.

                         right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.

               Hooper cuts the engines as Quint swings nimbly down. He stands 
               stock still on the main deck, motioning Brody to be silent.

               Then picking up the newly rigged rod, Quint softshoes it 
               over to the chair. About to sit down, he freezes.

               CLOSE - QUINT

               looking hard at something.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               staring, eyes widening.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               moving in, surprised, interested, fascinated.

               THEIR COMBINED POINT OF VIEW

               We see the shark. First the fin... then the head and upper 
               jaws, ten or twenty yards off the side of the boat. It finally 
               submerges, its tail giving a final slap.

               ANGLE ON QUINT

               He puts his rod away and stares at it. And stares. And stares.

               Hooper is the first to break the silence.

                         25 feet. And three tons of him there.

               Hooper is nearly beside himself with a strange ecstasy. He 
               leaps toward his gear.

                                     QUINT
                              (quietly, to Brody)
                         I never saw one that big.

                         What do we do? Get some help? Radio 
                         in?

               Quint ignores him and moves off into the pilot house, where 
               he swiftly takes out his green case, and opens it to begin 
               to assemble something inside it. Brody is alone on the deck 
               with Hooper.

                                     BRODY
                         How're we gonna handle this?

               Hooper is contained in his own excitement. He has finally 
               come up with what he was looking for -- an expensive Nikon 
               through which he peers intently at the shark alongside. He 
               is talking half to himself as he fine-tunes the range finder 
               and focus.

               He is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional 
               boil.

               CLOSE ON QUINT IN THE PILOT HOUSE

               He is assembling the Greener harpoon gun, deftly screwing on 
               the long wooden stock, the heavy steel barrel, and big shaft 
               with the wicked barbs, the frame all rigged with line. Past 
               him, on the deck, we can still see Hooper. As Quint is working 
               with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life.

                                     RADIO VOICE (V.O.)

                         Just fine, Missus. We'll be back 
                         soon. Everything's fine. We haven't 
                         seen anything yet. Orca out.

               He snaps off the radio, and, for good measure, pulls the 
               plug from the power source.

               ANGLE FROM DECK

               The big shark is slicing through the water just below the 
               surface, its fin high, the big gray back glistening, the 
               teeth gleaming.

                         Damn it! I need something in the 
                         foreground to give it some scale. 
                         Martin! Stand here! No, to your left!

               He is positioning Martin frantically, trying to include Brody, 
               the shark, and the Orca in the same frame. Quint finishes 
               with the gun, and as a final gesture, snaps an explosive 
               cartridge into the breech. He empties the box of cartridges 
               onto the table, snatches up a big handful, and drops them 
               into a pocket, and heads out on deck, bound for the bow 
               pulpit.

               ON DECK

               Quint appears with the harpoon gun. He throws one end of the 
               line to Hooper.

                                     QUINT
                         Here. Rig this to the forward keg up 
                         there.

               He indicates the barrels on the foredeck.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)

                         my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've 
                         got to get a clean shot at that 
                         porker's head.

               Quint moves up toward the bow, Brody goes up to the flying 
               bridge to take the wheel, Hooper starts for the foredeck, 
               but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing gear around as he 
               desperately hunts for something.

                                     QUINT
                         Hurry up, rig the line!

               ANGLE ON HOOPER

               He finds what he's looking for. A small, powerful strobe 
               unit, waterproofed, a miniature signal beacon. He triggers 
               it, and it begins to pulse with a light we can see even in 
               the sun.

               Hooper scampers to the foredeck and begins to rig the light 
               to the first barrel, as the shark begins to surface near the 
               bow.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Come to port. Watch my hand. Steady 
                         now...

               He guides Brody with hand signals. Brody tries urgently to 
               get it right, not to oversteer, to try to hold the big boat 
               with its throbbing diesels on the course that Quint is 
               indicating.

                         The line, man, the line!

               Hooper is rigging like crazy.

               Brody steering f.g., Hooper on the foredeck with the barrels, 
               Quint leaning out over the pulpit, the gun at the ready, the 
               shark crossing inexorably in front of them.

               CLOSE ON QUINT

               Agonizing over his shot as the shark approaches, glancing 
               back to see if the line is properly rigged and Hooper is 
               clear of it.

                         Get clear, damn you!

               The shark is in position, Hooper shouts, a moment too late.

                         Clear!

               Quint fires. The harpoon slams into the shark behind his 
               head, half-way along the back in front of the big dorsal 
               fin.

               The rope snaps out in a blur of violent motion, Hooper jumps 
               back, and the barrel leaps out of its rack, pulled by the 
               line rigged to the harpoon. It bounds forward and into the 
               sea, past Quint, who is already reloading, mounting another 
               steel shaft. In the distance, the barrel bobs and skips 
               violently in the water, dragged by the shark in his merciless 
               moves.

                         with that on.

               Hooper, furious with himself, runs for the flying bridge to 
               take the helm from Brody.

               THE FLYING BRIDGE, BRODY AND HOOPER

               Hooper has snatched the wheel, and is ramming the throttle 
               forward as he spins the wheel in a frantic 180 degree turn.

                         around!

               His eyes dart about the ocean, looking for the barrel, as he 
               hot-dogs the ship around in a violent expression of his own 
               disgust with himself.

                                     HOOPER

                         I'm coming about!

               He spins the wheel again, trying to make the big boat handle 
               like a formula speedster. The decks tip and the rigging sways 
               under the sudden strain. Brody is caught unaware, and tumbles 
               off his feet, sliding across the deck to fetch up against a 
               wall. the M1 Rifle is close to his hand. He stares at it.

               FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

               Hooper is anguished, intense, trying to find the shark, 
               spinning the wheel, compounding his error, tipping the boat 
               in rolling turns as he crosses his own wake. Quint has turned 
               his back to the sea, and is in the pulpit looking up at 
               Hooper, staring at him, excluding everything else.

               As Quint folds his arms and stares at Hooper, we realize the 
               sun is going down, and it's getting dark.

                         We got a barrel on him. We can't 
                         lose him. We stay out here until we 
                         find him.

               Hooper throttles back, and the roar of the diesels subsides 
               and the boat resumes an even keel, slowly circling the ocean.

                                     BRODY
                         Let's call in -- we can radio and 
                         have a big boat here in an hour...

                                     QUINT

                         You hired me, remember? It's my 
                         $10,000. It's my shark...

               EXT. ORCA - OPEN SEA - NIGHT

               Throttled back to slow ahead, the boat circles the water 
               endlessly, staying over the shark like an avenging angel. 
               Its running lights gleam in the night, and a glow lights the 
               interior of the pilot house. A bright strobe glints on the 
               water winking once like a firefly.

               INT. PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

               Brody and Hooper at the table, Quint at the wheel, keeping 
               his eye on the light.

                                     QUINT
                         He's up again.

               He corrects course slightly to keep the barrel buoy in sight.

               Hooper is sitting at the table, morose. Brody is staring at 
               a couple of open cans of beans or beef stew, or some other 
               crappy rations Quint has on board. Dirty spoons stuck in the 
               open cans show us this has not been a formal dinner. Quint 
               fumbles on the chart shelf and produces some of his home 
               brew.

               He takes a pull, and hands it to Hooper, who takes a double.

               Brody touches the fresh abrasion on his forehead, where the 
               fishing rod caught him.

               Quint bends forward and pulls his hair aside to show something 
               near the crown.

                                     QUINT
                         That's not so bad. Look at this: 
                         ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans, 
                         in Boston, where some sunovabitch 
                         winged me upside the head with a 
                         spittoon.

               Brody looks politely. Hooper stirs himself.

                                     HOOPER

                         Steve Kaplan bit me during recess.

               Quint is amused. He presents his own formidable forearm.

               Brody is fascinated. Quint and Hooper take a long pull from 
               the bottle.

                                     QUINT

                         the snot locker and laid him amongst 
                         the sweetpeas.

                         Ever see one like this?

               He hauls up his pants leg, revealing a wicked white scar.

               He starts rolling up his own dirty pants leg.

                         just like somebody caressed me with 
                         a nutmeg grater...

               Brody is drawn into their boasting comparisons. He secretly 
               checks his own appendix scar, decides not to enter the 
               contest.

                                     HOOPER
                         I'll drink to your leg.

                         And I'll drink to yours.

               They toast each other. Brody looks around, sees the strobe 
               blink once through the darkened window.

                                     QUINT
                         Wait a minute, young fella. Look. 
                         Just look. Don't touch...

               He starts lowering his pants to reveal a place on one hip 
               where the tissue is scarred and irregular.

                                     QUINT

               Hooper is pulling at his shirt, trying to get it off, but 
               it's tangling its sleeves, and won't come undone.

                                     HOOPER
                         Gimme a hand, here. I got something

               Brody lends a hand. The shirt slips part way off.

                         Ellen.

               The two men raise their mugs in a toast.

                         And here's to the ladies. And here's

                         Yeah. The U.S.S. Indianapolis.
                         June 29th, 1945, three and a half 
                         minutes past midnight, two torpedoes 
                         from a Japanese submarine slammed 
                         into our side. Two or three. We was 
                         still under sealed orders after 
                         deliverin' the bomb...the Hiroshima 
                         bomb...we was goin' back across the 
                         Pacific from Tinian to Leyte. Damn 
                         near eleven hundred men went over 
                         the side. The life boats was lashed 
                         down so tight to make the bomb run 
                         we couldn't cut a single one adrift. 
                         Not one. And there was no rafts. 
                         None. That vessel sank in twelve 
                         minutes. Yes, that's all she took. 
                         We didn't see the first shark till 
                         we'd been in the water about an hour. 
                         A thirteen-footer near enough. A 
                         blue. You measure that by judgin' 
                         the dorsal to the tail. What we didn't 
                         know... of course the Captain knew...I 
                         guess some officers knew... was the 
                         bomb mission had been so secret, no 
                         distress signals was sent. What the 
                         men didn't know was that they wouldn't 
                         even list us as overdue for a week. 
                         Well, I didn't know that -- I wasn't 
                         an officer -- just as well perhaps. 
                         So some of us were dead already -- 
                         in the water -- just hangin' limp in 
                         our lifejackets. And several already 
                         bleedin'. And the three hundred or 
                         so laying on the bottom of the ocean. 
                         As the light went, the sharks came 
                         crusin'. We formed tight groups -- 
                         somewhat like squares in an old battle -- 
                         You know what I mean -- so that when 
                         one come close, the man nearest would 
                         yell and shout and pound the water 
                         and sometimes it worked and the fish 
                         turned away, but other times that 
                         shark would seem to look right at a 
                         man -- right into his eyes -- and in 
                         spite of all shoutin' and poundin' 
                         you'd hear that terrible high 
                         screamin' and the ocean would go 
                         red, then churn up as they ripped 
                         him.  Then we'd reform our little 
                         squares. By the first dawn the sharks 
                         had taken more than a hundred. Hard 
                         for me to count but more than a 
                         hundred. I don't know how many sharks. 
                         Maybe a thousand. I do know they 
                         averaged six men an hour. All kinds -- 
                         blues, makos, tigers. All kinds.
                              (Pause)
                         In the middle of the second day, 
                         some of us started to go crazy from 
                         the thirst. One fella cried out he 
                         saw a river, another claimed he saw 
                         a waterfall, some started to drink 
                         the ocean and choked on it, and some 
                         left our little groups -- our little 
                         squares -- and swam off alone lookin' 
                         for islands and the sharks always 
                         took them right away. It was mainly 
                         the young fellas that did that -- 
                         the older ones stayed where they 
                         was. That second day -- my life jacket 
                         rubbed me raw and that was more blood 
                         in the water. Oh my. On Thursday 
                         morning I bumped up against a friend 
                         of mine -- Herbie Robinson from 
                         Cleveland -- a bosun's mate -- it 
                         seemed he was asleep but when I 
                         reached over to waken him, he bobbed 
                         in the water and I saw his body upend 
                         because he'd been bitten in half 
                         beneath the waist. Well Chief, so it 
                         went on -- bombers high overhead but 
                         nobody noticin' us. Yes -- suicides, 
                         sharks, and all this goin' crazy and 
                         dyin' of thirst. Noon the fifth day, 
                         Mr. Hooper, a Lockheed Ventura swung 
                         around and came in low. Yes. He did 
                         that. Yes, that pilot saw us. And 
                         early evenin', a big fat PBY come 
                         down out of the sky and began the 
                         pickup.  That was when I was most 
                         frightened of all -- while I was 
                         waitin' for my turn. Just two and a 
                         half hours short of five days and 
                         five nights when they got to me and 
                         took me up. Eleven hundred of us 
                         went into that ocean -- three hundred 
                         and sixteen got out. Yeah. Nineteen 
                         hundred and forty five. June the 
                         29th.
                              (pause)
                         Anyway, we delivered the bomb.

               EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

               Quint has just finished his story, and we are looking across 
               the quiet night sea to the Orca slowly circling in the night, 
               the warm light in the pilot house barely revealing the figures 
               of the three men inside, the red and green running lights 
               winking along the ship's flanks. We hear the distant boom 
               and drawn-out hoot of a whale.

               INT. ORCA PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     BRODY
                         What the hell?

                                     HOOPER
                         It's a whale out there.

               There's a brief, eerie pause. Quint breaks the silence by 
               muttering into song, which he slowly swells.

                                     QUINT
                              (singing)
                         Show me the way to go home... I'm 
                         tired and I want to go to bed. I had 
                         a little drink about an hour ago, 
                         and it went right to my head.
                              (etc.)

               Gradually, Hooper and Brody join in, and the pilothouse 
               becomes a warm cozy place.

               EXT. OCEAN

               The Orca and its song in the night. In the foreground, the 
               barrel and strobe light flash up into view, and behind them, 
               the big dorsal fin surfaces, and glides ominously towards 
               the ship.

               INT. PILOT HOUSE

               The song is continuing, and we hear the barest hint of a 
               scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men. Quint's 
               eyes abruptly narrow as his sensitive ears are the first to 
               hear the abrasion of his ship. Things vibrate on the shelves.

               Quint stops singing, Hooper and Brody continue a duet. The 
               scraping repeats, and Hooper now senses it. He drops out of 
               the song, leaving Brody singing solo.

                                     QUINT
                              (quietly, to Hooper)
                         Start the engines.

               As Brody hears this and is about to stop singing, the boat 
               is suddenly bumped from below, and the gentle scraping turns 
               to a violent assault somewhere on the understructure of the 
               vessel. Water bubbles up into the hold. Brody starts, and 
               looks at the radio. He is about to move towards it when 
               Quint's urgent instructions stop him.

                                     QUINT
                         He's busting the shaft! Start the 
                         pump!

                                     BRODY
                         Where...?

                                     QUINT
                         The bilge pumps. There --

               He leaves Brody in the pilot house, and runs onto the deck, 
               grabbing his M-1 rifle as he goes. Brody hits a switch and 
               we hear the pumps starting.

               ANGLE ON THE ORCA

               Hooper is on the flybridge, starting the engines, but the 
               diesels sound wrong.

                                     QUINT
                         Cut the engines!

               Hooper does.

                                     HOOPER
                         Rudder bearings?

               The boat is assaulted again. Quint fires over the stern, 
               emptying a clip into the water.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         Get up forward! Watch for him!

               Brody moves cautiously up to the bow.

                                     QUINT
                         Keep your eyes open, Mr. Hooper!

               Hooper stands ready on the bridge, Quint pacing the stern 
               deck.

                                     QUINT
                         Nobody sleeps! Nobody.

               He jams a fresh clip into the M-1. The men scan the seas 
               around them. Quint resumes their song, louder this time, 
               more defiant.

                                     QUINT
                              (sings)
                         Show me the way to go home... I'm 
                         tired and I want to go to bed.
                              (etc.)

               Hooper and Brody join in from their respective positions.

               EXT. OCEAN, WIDE ON THE ORCA

               The men in place, singing, the water sparkling towards the 
               horizon, the stars twinkling above. The sound of a distant 
               whale in distant counterpoint.

               EXT. THE ORCA - DAWN

               Brody is at the wheel on the flying bridge, while Hooper and 
               Quint have a hatch up on the stern, and are working together 
               to repair the damaged rudder controls torn loose by the shark. 
               Hooper is bucking the steel rod, while Quint is hammering 
               away at the joint, trying to drive a new pin.

               The engine is idling. Bits of iron clutter the deck, along 
               with a few rough, outsized tools and greasy rags and gaskets.

                                     QUINT
                         More left rudder! More! Left hand 
                         down now, Chief.

               Brody tries to comply.

                                     HOOPER
                              (shifting his grip)
                         Lemme get a better angle on it. Now.

               Quint hammers again.

                                     QUINT
                         He's bent the housing. You can hear 
                         it.

               And we can. The Orca's diesels are no longer smooth. Brody 
               suddenly sees something, and points.

               BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

               The barrel is surfaced directly ahead of them, just off the 
               port side. They are drifting up to it.

                                     BRODY
                         The barrel!

               The strobe light winks at them. Quint holds up a hand:  
               "Quiet!"

               Everything stops as they watch the barrel coming slowly up 
               on them.

                                     QUINT
                         It's him.

               He takes a killing lance from the rack. Hooper gets a 
               boathook.

                                     QUINT
                         He's under the keg. Careful --

               Hooper leans out gingerly, snagging the barrel with the hook.

               It bobs lightly in the water, an innocent bystander. Hooper 
               shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in.

                                     QUINT
                              (suspicious)
                         Easy -- just want to goose him up. 
                         The minute he runs, drop it or you'll 
                         lose your hands.

               Hooper gets the line and starts hauling it up. No resistance.

               It comes easily over the transom into a coil on the deck.  
               He and Quint exchange looks.

                                     QUINT
                         Here -- gimme. I don't see what he's 
                         been doin'.

               WATER - ANGLE

               Both men are draped over the side, their chins almost touching 
               the water on the aft side. From the opposite starboard 
               direction, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the Great 
               White. First the fin, then the conical nose and the upper 
               border of wide, grinning teeth. It knifes through the water 
               in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed 
               toward the unsuspecting men.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               His instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquired sense of 
               direction.

                                     BRODY
                              (top of his lungs)
                         Shark! Starboard!

               CLOSE - HOOPER AND QUINT

               They turn just in time, and a long spine-stretch saves them 
               from instant decapitation. The Great White passes the transom, 
               the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed-
               off cable. It rolls on its side and looks at them as it 
               passes.

               Past the stern the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope 
               out of Quint's hands, shearing a huge swath through the paint, 
               peeling it off like a plane, taking one of the bronze letters 
               out of "Orca." The shark begins an arc to sea, its fin cutting 
               the water, and starts circling the boat. Quint notices his 
               cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing 
               it.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         Haul in that rope -- it'll foul us!
                              (then to Brody on the 
                              bridge)
                         Start the engine!

               The diesels start with a terrible grinding.

                                     QUINT
                         Easy! It'll tear right out!

                                     HOOPER
                              (hauling)
                         The shaft is giving.

               Hooper slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, clearing 
               the deck for action once again.

                                     BRODY
                              (on bridge)
                         That's it! Radio in for help!

                                     QUINT
                         Shut up! Just pump her out!

                                     BRODY
                              (coming down off the 
                              bridge)
                         Yeah, Captain, as soon as I make a 
                         call.

               Brody heads for the radio in the pilot house.

               QUINT - CLOSE

               A perfectly terrible look comes over him. He raises up and 
               starts after Brody. Brody disappears into the cabin. Quint 
               pauses outside and sees:

               INSERT - QUINT'S LEAD-CENTERED BASEBALL BAT

               his calloused hand grabs it up fiercely.

               INT. RADIO SHACK

               Brody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on 
               the complex console.

                                     QUINT (O.S.)
                         Beg your pardon --

               ANGLE - DOORWAY

               Quint appears, silhouetted in the hot light of the door, 
               raising his bat.

                                     QUINT
                         Duty first and pleasure after --

               CLOSE - BRODY

               looking up in horror, covering his face.

               CLOSE - QUINT

               Quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can summon.

               Crash!

               Sparks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of 
               metal ricochet all over the cabin as Quint demolishes the 
               ship-to-shore radio.

               Quint takes a happy breath, winks at Brody and hands him the 
               bat.

                                     QUINT
                         Excuse me!

               Brody's adrenaline turns his fear into rage. His glasses are 
               cracked or broken by flying pieces of radio. He seizes the 
               bat, and pound the shattered radio for emphasis.

                                     BRODY
                         Some great idea! Now where are we?  
                         Some goddamn skipper you are. You're 
                         certifiable, y'know that? You're a 
                         real treat! Certifiable! Bananas!

               His tirade is interrupted by an urgent bellow from Hooper.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               Pointing at the fin.

                                     HOOPER
                         Coming right to us!

                                     QUINT
                         No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, 
                         he'll hit us head on --
                              (the engine clanks)
                         Slower! Throttle back ---

               ANGLE - OVER THE BOW

                                     QUINT
                              (raising harpoon)
                         Hard to port!

               Hooper pulls the boat into a tight turn and Quint has a shot 
               at the upward rolling flank. He sinks it with careful 
               precision.

                                     QUINT
                         Try shakin' that out!

               Brody emerges from the cabin as the rope zips overboard, and 
               the barrel, changing over, catapults into the air before 
               plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash.

                                     BRODY
                              (shouting to Quint)
                         Did you get him in the head?

                                     QUINT
                              (to Brody)
                         No! No! No!
                              (to Hooper)
                         Swing around! After him!

               ON THE FLYBRIDGE

               Hooper can see the fin racing ahead of the barrel. Diving 
               down. Up again -- Quint prepares another iron. Brody is 
               digging in his bag. He comes up with his 2" .357 service 
               revolver.

                                     QUINT
                         More gas... go to half! Get me right 
                         alongside him --

               The engine thuds and knocks.

                                     HOOPER
                              (shouting down)
                         We can't rev it up this high --

               Suddenly the barrel gongs into the side of the Orca.

                                     QUINT
                         Watch it!

               Hooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope.

                                     QUINT
                         Atta boy!

               Quint leans to one side, harpoon over his head. The Great 
               White breaks water and...

                                     QUINT
                         Take two, they're small!

               He sinks it deep. We hear shots. As the new rope whips out, 
               Brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, in regulation 
               police combat pistol stance, holding his .357 in both hands, 
               firing at the shark's head.

               Quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the 
               barrel goes over.

                                     HOOPER
                              (shouting at Brody)
                         Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy 
                         on his own blood already!

                                     BRODY
                         I can't stand here doing nothing!

                                     QUINT
                         Order in the court!

               WATER LEVEL ANGLE

               He has seen the two barrels pop to the surface.

                                     QUINT
                              (racing over)
                         Three'll do it! He's havin' trouble 
                         with two!

               He yells to Hooper and Brody as he swings behind the controls.

                                     QUINT
                         Grab yourselves a couple of poles!

               Quint steers "Slow Ahead," engine protesting, as he maneuvers 
               toward the moving barrels. Quint peers down, steering closer 
               and closer.

                                     QUINT
                         Get ready! Now snag 'em!

               Together Brody and Hooper hook a barrel-rope and hold on for 
               dear life as the shark changes course.

                                     QUINT
                         Pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto 
                         the transom -- free ride.

               Brody and Hooper pull in with all they are worth as Quint 
               helps out by wheeling in a circle. He laughs to himself, 
               enjoying the spectacle.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               securing the rope to a cleat but allowing the barrel to hang 
               overboard. Brody ties his now-perfect bowline adjacent cleat.

               WIDE ANGLE - ORCA

               The boat is jarred violently from side to side as the 
               underwater force of the Great White jerks and heaves them to 
               and fro, up and down, side to side...

               ANGLE - HOOPER AND BRODY

               are both torn off their feet as the boat is thrust forward.

               FLYBRIDGE - QUINT

               sees the fin ahead. It is pulling the boat.

                                     QUINT
                         Get tired! That's the idea! Here's a 
                         little reverse for you!

               The shark leaps partially out of the water, and the sight is 
               both horrifying and awesome. Its jaws break water, snapping 
               at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated.

               Quint throws the Orca into neutral and shouts down:

                                     QUINT
                         Haul in -- watch the prop!

               With that, Quint slides down to the prow, putting another 
               shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and 
               balance. The shark can be seen directly ahead, threshing 
               closer.

                                     QUINT
                         Now! Untie 'em! Quick! He'll tear us 
                         to pieces.

               He fires the iron, and the shark veers downward in a gushing 
               shower of spray.

               HOOPER AND BRODY

               They are trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes are 
               stretched too taut. They jump out of the way, falling flat

               on the deck as the ropes sweep over them, knocking over 
               objects, skeetering across the deck. A tight jerking motion, 
               and the Orca is dragged through the water -- backwards. And 
               much too fast. Water is splashing up over the transom in its 
               backward wake. The engines groan and complain.

                                     QUINT
                         Damn head is too far away. He's too 
                         big.

               Wrenched to one side, Quint is knocked from his feet.

               CLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS

               A moment of slackness, and then a great surge of raw strength.

               The rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintered wood 
               spraying -- and the barrels fly over the water. They disappear 
               beneath the turbulent grey surface.

               The three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouring sweat, 
               look out at the blank water.

               ANGLE - OCEAN

               Pop -- pop -- pop. One, two, three, the barrels surface -- 
               ready for more.

                                     QUINT
                              (amazed at the shark's 
                              strength)
                         He can't go so deep. Not with all 
                         those on him.

               Brody looks down at his feet. There is salt water up to their 
               shoe tops.

                                     BRODY
                         What about us?

                                     QUINT
                              (mentally assessing 
                              the damage)
                         Have to pump her steady, s'all.

               The barrels start a wide circle, each cuts through the water, 
               pushing a wave before it and leaving a wake behind.

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         Follow him --
                              (to Brody)
                         You start pumpin' out here.

               Quint tosses Brody the hand pump, then picks up his M-1, and 
               checks the load.

                                     HOOPER (O.S.)
                              (on bridge)
                         He's heading under -- !

                                     QUINT
                              (incredulously)
                         No way! He can't!

               ANGLE - OCEAN

               The barrels approaching the Orca dip below the surface, one -- 
               two -- three.

                                     BRODY
                         Where'd he go?

               Brody looks around. Hooper on the flying bridge searching in 
               all directions. Quint is looking more appalled every second.

                                     QUINT
                              (helplessly)
                         He can't stay down with three barrels 
                         on him! Where is he?!

                                     BRODY
                         Have you ever had one do this?

                                     QUINT
                              (and he means this)
                         No!

               Booming thud at the keel. Brody slides on the wet deck and 
               Quint loses his footing, falling into Brody's arms.

               WITH HOOPER ON THE FLY BRIDGE

               It seems the only place out of reach of the shark. Quint 
               climbs up, Brody following him, reloading his pistol.

               Just then, the barrels pop up ahead, veer left, and duck 
               under.

                                     QUINT
                         Follow him!

                                     HOOPER
                         He's under!

               BRODY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW

                                     BRODY
                         There!
                              (points wildly)

               The barrels have surfaced and we see the monster shadow 
               sliding under the Orca, seemingly endless. Violent scraping 
               sounds.

                                     BRODY
                         He's trying to sink us!

                                     QUINT
                              (to Hooper)
                         Dead astern! Zig-zag!

               Quint is grimly silent. Brody senses that Quint is in the 
               fight of (and for) his life.

               The Orca taking evasive action. But the three barrels are 
               closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying 
               themselves with every rotation of the damaged shaft.

                         BRODY
                 He's chasing us! I 
                 don't believe it. 

                                                       QUINT
                                               Full throttle! To port!

               ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

               Hooper is jamming the throttle forward, but the engine is 
               pounding and knocking wildly. The barrels circle and move 
               in. Quint has his rifle ready.

                                     HOOPER
                              (suddenly giving Quint 
                              the wheel)
                         Hold her.

               He leaps to his gear, trying desperately to get his dart 
               gun.

               Just then, the shark attacks, breaking water and rising over 
               the boat like a rocket; snout, jaws, pectoral fins, belly, 
               falling sideways. A vast spray drenches the men. Quint fires 
               into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness.

                                     HOOPER
                              (loading)
                         Keep him there! Keep him!

               The Orca shudders from side to side. From Hooper's point of 
               view we can the shark gripping the transom in his jaws, 
               shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to 
               side, trying to tear a chunk out of the very hull. Quint has 
               reloaded and is firing into the fish. Brody has a wicked 
               pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing 
               and gouging it, trying for the eyes. The killing lust is on 
               all three men.

                                     QUINT
                         Throttling back!

               The boat surges, the shark gives a final unbalances wrench, 
               and disengages. The dorsal fin circles off, beginning a wide 
               loop around the boat.

               The engine quivers and dies, the boat without power, rolling 
               half awash, a wounded victim.

               The fin dips, the barrels follow, the shark disappears beneath 
               the waves. There is complete silence.

               THE THREE MEN ON DECK

               In the dead quiet, we can hear the lap of waves against the 
               hull, the hoarse panting breathing of the men, the pings and 
               pops of the cooling, dying engines.

               QUINT AND THE TRANSOM

               He eyes the stern. Huge cracks and broken timber testify to 
               the fury of the attack.

                                     QUINT
                              (very quietly, to 
                              Hooper)
                         What can that gun of yours do?

                                     HOOPER
                         Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine 
                         nitrate. If I can hit him. I can 
                         kill him. But I gotta be close.  
                         Very close.

                                     BRODY
                              (the awful realization)
                         You gotta go in the water...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ON DECK, LATER

               Quint and Hooper are assembling the shark cage, its shiny 
               bars the only undamaged things on deck. Brody is working 
               too, bolting the sections together.

                                     HOOPER
                              (in command now)
                         Rig the cable to the roof eyebolts.

               The men are speaking in near whispers, quiet in the silence 
               that surrounds them. Hooper is in his wet suit, adjusting 
               weights, mask, tanks, etc. The cage is standing in the stern.

               Quint runs a line from the gin pole to the roof section.

               Hooper climbs in though the top.

                                     HOOPER
                         Take me up.

               Brody cranks the winch, hoisting cage and Hooper into the 
               air. Quint balances the gin pole lines, Hooper crouching in 
               the cage, examining it for stresses; satisfied, he holds out 
               his hand. Quint puts the spear gun into it.

               CLOSE ON HOOPER IN THE CAGE

               He examines his weapon, checking the power load, with the 
               big wicked-looking syringe head uncapped to reveal its razor 
               point.

                                     HOOPER
                         Lower away, Chief.
                              (then, to Quint)
                         Try and keep him off me till I'm 
                         under.

               Hooper inside, looking out the bars of the cage, gives Brody 
               a reassuring smile, then pops his mouthpiece between his 
               teeth and checks his regulator. Brody steps back, and with 
               Quint guiding the cage, begins lowering it off the gin pole 
               boom arm into the sea alongside the boat.

               Brody and Hooper stare at each another as their faces pass, 
               Hooper sliding down into the cold grey ocean.

               As Hooper disappears beneath the surface, Quint and Brody 
               exchange a long look between them.

               UNDERWATER - CAGE

               HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

               Submerging. The sky, horizon, water line, clean fresh sea 
               air then... the magnificent innerspaces, with bubbles 
               sparkling in front of us.

               ANGLE - HOOPER IN THE CAGE

               as he floats to twenty feet Hooper never stops looking around 
               360 degrees. He removes the rubber guard from the needle and 
               waits.

               EXT. THE SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

               Their turning heads tell us that the barrels are still 
               circling.

               Suddenly, both heads stop turning.

               THE SEA

               The barrels have come to a stop. Delicately, they change 
               course and meander toward the lowered cage.

               UNDERWATER - HOOPER

               His back is to us. He is just now completing a visual sweep 
               and turns, eyes front into closeup and: fixes wildly on 
               something monstrous... and fascinating.

               HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

               The water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward in 
               the blue. From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly -- 
               comes the shark. It moves with no apparent effort, sinuous 
               beyond comparison. As it nears the cage, it turns, and its 
               ghastly length passes right in front of him: first the snout, 
               then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.

               Hooper tentatively reaches out. It is too far for the 
               strychnine pole. The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes, 
               iron scars, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge 
               the passing currents with pink.

               SURFACE

               The trailing barrels gong and scratch the keel of the Orca 
               above. Brody and Quint leap back.

               HOOPER - CLOSE

               The shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt. Hooper, 
               expecting the shark to attack out of that same general 
               direction, braces himself, pole extended through the bars, 
               breathing faster, straining his eyes into the gloom and... 
               we see that the shark attacking from behind him.

               The cage is sent careening. Hooper grabs the bars for dear 
               life. The shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal 
               jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending 
               the bars like clothes hangers. Hooper can't turn the pointed 
               end of the pole around, his body jammed as far away from the 
               non-rational attacker as possible.

               Hooper is trapped.

               The shark withdraws to get some running room then charges 
               again. The bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bars, 
               the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hooper's torso, 
               the tail thrusting it forward. Hooper drops the strychnine 
               pole between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward rapture 
               depth.

               All the shark needs is one more good thrust before separating 
               Hooper at the waistline. Through frantic bubbles Hooper 
               fumbles with the overhead hatch cover, kicking up and out of 
               the cage. The shark backpedals with its tail, but the broad 
               head won't shake loose.

               Hooper rushes downwards, after the strychnine pole.

               ANGLE - SHARK

               The shark twists free of the cage and arrows downward after 
               Hooper.

               Hooper nearly recovers the pole. Again it slips from his 
               frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow abyss.  
               Hooper turns and looks up.

               The Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above.

               SURFACE

               One of the barrel ropes snakes around the cage rope and pulls 
               taut.

               HOOPER - DEEP

               Turning to meet the monster which -- though held back for a 
               moment by the snarled rope -- now surges forward.

               SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

               The Orca is listing dangerously aft, the ginpole bent almost 
               to the breaking point. Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul 
               up the cage. Quint attaches the end of Brody's rope to a 
               hand-winch. The ginpole is splitting.

                                     QUINT
                         Let go of it!

               The pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale... 
               the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Orca, dragging 
               it, but Quint won't give up the winch. Brody hauls on the 
               rope barehanded.

               UNDERWATER - HOOPER

               maneuvering downward, away from the jaws... Suddenly the 
               crazed shark veers upward for the surface.

               SURFACE - QUINT

               The winch is working faster now, Quint demonically winding 
               it in. The crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks 
               water.

               Brody is horrified. The cage is empty!

                         QUINT
                    (a horrible scream)
                 He's comin' up -- !

                                                       BRODY
                                               He's taken him!

               MASTER ANGLE

               The shark breaks water right beside the Orca, rising with a 
               great whooshing noise. It rises vertically, towering overhead, 
               blocking out the sun. The pectoral fins seem to reach forward.  
               The shark, in all of its monstrous glory, falls onto the 
               stern of the boat with a shattering crash, narrowly missing 
               Quint and Brody. It drives the stern underwater, the ocean 
               pours in over the transom. The jaws snap from side to side.  
               Brody flounders backwards away from it.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               He is clinging to the mast for dear life, as the ship begins 
               to tilt to stern, and everything starts to break loose around 
               him.

               NIGHTMARE ANGLE - DECK OF THE ORCA

               The giant jaws are snapping irresistibly at everything: great 
               chunks of wood torn out of the deck and superstructure.

               Deck chair, irons, rope, gear, beercans, bottles, Brody's 
               bag, all are food for the insatiable maw blindly churning 
               away.

               Quint is clinging next to a rack of lances: he is enraged at 
               this ultimate violation of his territory. He snatches up a 
               lance and hurls himself at the shark with a wordless bellow.

               The great head weaves side to side, the deck is at a 
               treacherous incline, slippery with blood and seawater. Quint's 
               footing falters and slips, he stumbles at the Mouth of Hell, 
               the big teeth seize him and snap.

               Quint's roar of rage and pain is choked off as his body is 
               clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head and 
               legs suddenly contort as the shark's teeth meet across his 
               torso. Blood gushes onto the deck. The remnants of his body 
               tumble from the shark's mouth.

               Brody sees the horror, hears the screams -- in his 
               desperation, he tears loose one of Hooper's remaining air 
               tanks, and hurls it at the monster. It tumbles into the bloody 
               well, wedging across the back of the mouth, the thick steel 
               blocking the cruel jaws.

               The shark's head shakes even more violently, trying to clear 
               the cold iron, but the tank is in to stay.

               DECK OF THE ORCA, LISTING BADLY

               To avoid sliding into the jaws, Brody scrambles on the titling 
               deck, bracing himself in the cabin door to avoid pitching 
               down into the bloody mouth. He fights his way into the cabin, 
               already a shambles.

               Below him, on the deck, the shark lunges again, shifting 
               weight so that the boat in now stern down, and listing to 
               the side. Water from the sea pours into the cabin.

               Another lunge by the shark. The huge snout and jaws slam up 
               against the doorframe, blocking escape, bloody, gnashing.

               More seawater. To stay in the cabin is to go down with the 
               ship.

               Brody clambers as far from the shark as he can, against the 
               forward wall of the pilothouse. He sees the window Hooper 
               used before. It's blocked by barrels and debris. He breaks 
               the side window highest above the water, edges out onto the 
               battered bridge.

               The shark rolls around, now half in the water. The ship is 
               sinking, the sea is not a viable alternative. Brody climbs 
               up into the flying bridge.

               The shark is still lunging and snapping. Brody is forced to 
               climb higher and higher as the ship slowly sinks beneath 
               him.

               CLOSE - BRODY

               He scrambles for his life onto the flying bridge, sees the M-
               1 stuck there, seizes it.

               OVER BRODY, LOOKING DOWN AT THE STERN

               He is bracing himself, aiming the rifle, taking a bead on 
               the steel tanks, silver gleaming in the bloody shark's mouth.  
               He fires. And fires. Bullets shatter the shark's teeth, 
               punching holes in the dripping snout.

               WIDE ON THE ORCA  EXPLOSION

               With a muffled boom, the perfect symmetry of the shark is 
               suddenly blown apart in a geyser of steel and blood as Brody's 
               shot hits the pressurized tank. A 30-foot cloud of water, 
               steel, shark and debris covers the sky.

               A gigantic convulsion hurls the Great White's mangled body 
               into the sea. The Orca slowly begins to turn over in its 
               death roll.

               UNDERWATER

               The shark's carcass floating down in a cloud of blood and 
               debris.

               A shadow clouds the waters, and the Orca's mass begins to 
               slip into the frame.

               CLOSE - HOOPER

               Emerging from beneath the surface, he raises his mask, spits 
               out his mouthpiece and kicks toward Brody.

               SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER

               Brody is holding onto a cushion, barely afloat, relieved the 
               shark is dead, yet stunned to see Hooper is still alive. The 
               two men share weak laughter, which soon trails off.

                                     HOOPER
                         Quint...?

                         No...

                              O.S.)
                         You think we can get back with those?

               SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER - ANOTHER ANGLE

               They swim through the debris, using two barrels as floats, 
               as dozens of seagulls feast on shark remains on the surface.

                                     BRODY
